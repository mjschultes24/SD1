1. Introduction
Satoshi Nakamoto’s seminal Bitcoin white paper proposed a revolutionary new digital
currency. But it was based on its predecessor Hashcash and the proof-of-work
concept  was  originally  proposed  by  Dwork  and  Naor  in  1992 1 as  a  means  of
combatting junk email.
1.1. The success of Bitcoin
So why did Bitcoin achieve such explosive economic value while its predecessors
were mostly of academic interest only?
1.2. Real Implementation
More  than  just  a  white  paper,                                                              “Satoshi”  released  the  open  source  reference
implementation in 2009. Because Bitcoin itself was more than just a white paper, but
an actual working system, it was able to capture the imagination of developers and
leverage the paradigm of open source software development to quickly iterate and
improve into a global-class financial infrastructure.
1.3. Open Governance
More importantly, Bitcoin is an open system that allows for evolution through forking
and as such provides an assurance of its long term trustworthiness. If stakeholders
ever get upset with the direction of Bitcoin, they can and already have produced forks
that users and miners can migrate to if they see fit.
1.4. The Problems of Bitcoin
The biggest problem with Bitcoin at the moment is that it has not broken out into
mainstream adoption. One study pegs the number of active cryptocurrency users to
between 2.9 and 5.8 million2.
This paper proposes a solution for adding a billion users to the cryptocurrency
movement  by  adding  two  key  elements  missing  in  order  to  provide  significant
adoption by mainstream users.
The next billion users have not yet entered cryptocurrency for two main reasons:
1.5. Too complicated
Cryptocurrency suffers from complexity for the average user. Managing private
keys, public keys, blockchain concepts—it’s all vastly out of the reach of the

PUNDI&X&ICO                                                                                     5




average user. In some cases the next Billion users may even barely be able to
operate a smartphone.
1.6. Not Relevant
Today, the only thing you can buy with a cryptocurrency are other cryptocurrencies.
The vast majority of people have no involvement with this process and no interest.
Until the average user can use cryptocurrency to buy a bag of rice or a loaf of
bread, the relevancy of cryptocurrency will be restricted to a small audience.
1.7. The Solution
This paper presents Pundi X, a platform for consumerizing cryptocurrencies by
enabling their use in retail Point of Sale (POS) through a mobile app and contactless
payment card.
Following in the footsteps of Bitcoin, Pundi X has the same properties of Real
Implementation, Open Governance and Incentivization that allows for the rapid global
expansion of the solution.
1.8. Real Implementation
Pundi X is a complete end-to-end solution for contactless and mobile retail point-of-
sale (POS) including a full-stack reference implementation of all the components. It
includes a mobile application, a contactless smart card and point-of-sale  (POS)
terminals that are already in deployment. All of these components will be made widely
available through open source and open specifications.
1.9. Open Governance
By releasing the full-stack reference implementations as open source and open
specifications, we can enable ubiquitous distribution worldwide of the Pundi X
protocols and ensure the rapid expansion of the value of the Pundi X Network.
1.10. Incentivization
The Pundi X network incentivizes participation through providing free hardware to
retail stores in the initial target geography of Indonesia. Users are incentivized to
participate in the Pundi X network through accessibility and ease of use and the
convenience of mobile payment.
With a solution that decreases complexity and adds relevance of cryptocurrencies to
end  users,  we  will  see  rapid  mainstream  adoption  of  cryptocurrencies  and  the
merging of the crypto-economy (current estimated value in October 2017 of 170B)
with the much larger mainstream economy (estimated value 214T).

2. Vision
The Next Billion Crypto Users
Pundi X will help to generate demand for new and old, as well as big and small
cryptocurrencies.  No  other  online  cryptocurrency  exchange  can  bring  in  new
cryptocurrency users from this segment and in the same number, thanks to our
powerful focus on attracting the consumer market.
From 9 million to 100 million
With future growth in mind, let’s look at some relevant statistics as of October
2017:
-  Bitcoin price is approximately USD 6,000
-  Bitcoin market capitalization is approximately USD 100 billion
-  Trading frequency is 250,000 times
-  Trade volume is USD 900 million.
With trading volume accounting for 1.1% of total volume, the reason bitcoin had
such respectable numbers is because there may be as many as 5.8 and 11.5 million
- an average of  8.7 million  - active wallets. However, the global bitcoin wallet
ownership numbers do not even reach 2% of the population of South East Asia.

Just take a few seconds to absorb this information … what if we could
introduce another 10 million, even 100 million users … what kind of impact
would this have on the cryptocurrency landscape?

100 million users in 3 years
Pundi X is concentrating initial traction efforts on South East Asia. Half of all
South East Asians live in Indonesia. We have local team with a deep understanding
of the Indonesian market - plus we have track record, connections and products to
match the local market’s needs.
We will spend the next two years building an extensive coverage of convenience
stores, shopping malls, retail shops, chain outlets, cafe, restaurants and other outlets.
We will use Pundi apps to coverage an even greater number of smaller sellers. Our
goal is for users to be able to buy and spend cryptocurrency within a five minutes
walk of any location in Jakarta.
With  our  initial  outreach  in  Indonesia,  we  intend  to  expand  into  Thailand,
Malaysia, Singapore, Japan and other regional markets simultaneously. Our plan is
to cover South East Asia within three years. At the same time we will explore other
parts of Asia, the Americas and Europe using our open source and open specification
for adoption of our protocol. In this way we can achieve our objectives in sales of
cryptocurrency; usage of cryptocurrency; and growth of cryptocurrency.
100 million to 1 billion in 5 years
Pundi X Platform will be provided as open source and the hardware reference
implementation specifications will be provided under Creative Commons. The Pundi
X solution will therefore be readily deployable across the world in regions outside of
Indonesia. With these international deployments, Pundi X will be able to reach the 1
Billion user mark.

3. Mission
3.1. The next billion
Cryptocurrencies, while capturing the imagination of 8 million people has almost no
meaning or value to most of the world.
Pundi X seeks to bring cryptocurrency to the next Billion users.
3.2. Benefits
By achieving this goal, Pundi X will help increase the value of cryptocurrency for all
users.
4. Problem
4.1 Complexity
One of the hardest problems in crypto is how to radically reduce the complexity of
handling cryptocurrency. Pundi X solves this problem through several end users
layers including a mobile wallet and a contactless smart card.
4.1.1.The Mobile Wallet
The mobile wallet is a helpful component because it solves the handling of
private  and  public  keys.  Instead  of  managing  a  long  and  complicated
blockchain public key, it may be preferable for end users to simply maintain a
password-based  system  that  is  much  more  familiar.  Increasingly  mobile
devices  can  be  secured  by  fingerprint  or  face  recognition,  so  even  the
password may become too complex for many users and in fact a point where
the complexity can help create a security risk.
4.1.2.The Smart Card
The second layer that reduces even more complexity is the use of a smart
card. The card can be used with or without the mobile app, and one member
of the family could use the mobile app to charge up multiple cards that can be
used by other members of the family.
By empowering users with a contactless smart card, this enables users to
avoid even the complexity of navigating a smartphone app.
PUNDI&X&ICO                                                                              9




4.1.3.The Pundi Platform
The Pundi Platform is the final round-up in solving the complexity issue. As a
both  software  and  hardware,  the  full  stack  implementation  allows  the
merchants to integrate their existing POS device by connecting with the Pundi
Platform and accept payment in lieu of purchase/sale of cryptocurrencies and
sale of daily goods & services. The hardware allows the use of the Smart Card
and any Mobile Wallet, whereby addressing the inter-operability complexity.
4.2 Relevance
As mentioned before, the fact that most cryptocurrencies can only be used to buy
other cryptocurrencies reduces the relevance of them to almost zero for most people.
Thus the problem can be reduced to this: how can cryptocurrency be converted to
fiat currencies for use in a “normal” everyday retail store to buy just about everything?
And how can fiat currencies be used to buy cryptos just about anywhere?
4.2.1.Crypto to fiat
The standard way in crypto banking to solve the problem of Crypto to fiat for
consumers  is  the                                                                          “Bitcoin  Debit  Card”.  This  leverages  the  VISA  and
MasterCard networks and enables users to access as many as 43 million Point
of Sale (PoS) terminals around the world.
One of the problems that has cropped up in this space recently is that VISA
and MasterCard have both blocked the access to their networks for crypto
debit cards. So for many geographies, another solution will be needed.
4.2.2.Crypto to crypto to fiat
Pundi X offers support to point-of-sale devices through a full stack reference
implementation of a contactless NFC mechanism that transacts directly with
the cryptocurrency blockchain.
The Point of Sale (POS) devices can become active on the Pundi X network
through multiple means including:
1) The full Pundi X reference implementation stack. Pundi X is giving the full
hardware reference implementation to retail environments as their primary
POS                                                                                         device                                                     in   Indonesia.
2) SDK -another easier approach is for existing POS device manufacturers to
use the open source PundiX library to support crypto to crypto to fiat transfers.
3) Mobile app—one of the easiest ways for a Point of Sale to include this
payment protocol is simply to download the mobile app onto a compatible
PUNDI&X&ICO                                                                                 10




device, Some retail environments may even choose to use an Android phone
or an iPhone (like the Apple Store) for customer checkout. Another approach
would be to use an android or IOS tablet device with the software.
The existence of any of these solutions allows the point of sale to sell anything
for cryptocurrency without the use of the VISA or Mastercard service by going
directly to the cryptocurrency blockchain to record transactions.
After these transactions are recorded, the Pundi X device or API reports back
to Pundi to ensure that the merchants and retailers are paid back in fiat.
4.2.3.Fiat to Crypto
How do Pundi X users buy cryptocurrencies? Three primary ways:
1)                                                                                  The mobile wallet can allow users to directly purchase
cryptocurrencies
2)                                                                                  Mobile to card—users can transfer cryptocurrency from the mobile
app to cards. An example of where this might be useful is if a member of the
household has minor technical skills, they can set up crypto backed debit
cards for the rest of the family and they don’t even need to worry about
working a phone app.
3)                                                                                  POS to card: for the simplest use case and for users who don’t even
                                                                                    have smartphones, the Pundi X system enables the POS, whether it be the
                                                                                    full hardware reference implementation, the mobile app or a tablet powered
by the mobile app to directly be charged by a cryptocurrency.

5. Solution
Pundi X aims to bring in the next billion crypto users as it allows users to buy
cryptocurrency anywhere and anytime. This will make PundiX the world’s largest
decentralized, offline cryptocurrency sales network. It is ‘decentralized’ because the
ecosystem and transaction records live on the blockchain. It is ‘offline’ because our
entry  point  is  via  Point-of-Sale                                                     (POS)  devices  installed  in  physical  outlets.
Pundi X allows for three customer use cases. It enables users to:
1)  Buy or Sell cryptocurrencies through a Point-of-Sale (PoS) device
2)  Buy anything using cryptocurrency through the Pundi X POS device (retail
point-of-sale)
3)  Pay peer-to-peer using mobile (like PayPal)
Pundi X consists of:
   Pundi X Mobile App - a smartphone app used to do the following things:
-                                                                                        buy BTC, ETH, LTC, XEM, PXS and cryptocurrency using cash or card
-                                                                                        sell BTC, ETH, LTC, XEM, PXS and cryptocurrency for cash

7. Pundi X Card
The Pundi X card is the physical multi-currency (fiat and cryptocurrencies) wallet
or a Crypto Debit card which can be loaded with cryptocurrencies via the POS
devices which are connected to the PundiX platform. The PundiX card also facilitates
payments  via  cryptocurrencies  held  in  the  card  through  NFC  and  contactless
technology.
With the future being Crypto, this physical debit card/wallet has a key use case
in the event of theft of the mobile phone or loss of battery or no service coverage.
The PundiX card will allow the easy onboarding of the next billion crypto users, who
can get accustomed to using cryptocurrencies.   We also envisage several channels
(Crypto Banks, Crypto Exchanges, POS device manufacturers, etc.) through which
the PundiX card can potentially become a regular feature.
8. Pundi X Platform
Starting with Indonesia, the largest country in South East Asia, our team aims to
provide retail outlets, restaurants and convenience stores with Pundi X Point-of-Sales
PUNDI&X&ICO                                                                              14




(POS) devices so that customers can use the cryptocurrency held in their accounts
to make daily purchases such as sugar and rice.*
In this way, Pundi X POS devices become the latest participants in the global
blockchain and consumers benefit because they can use cash, credit card or a digital
wallet to buy anything.
* These purchases using Pundi X are carried out by first selling a fraction of a unit of
cryptocurrency and buying the local fiat currency (Dollar, Rupiah etc.) and then local
currency is used to buy products or services. For example, if a pack of sugar costs 1 US
Dollar, users will sell approximately 0.00025 BTCs (Bitcoins) for 1 dollar and then use fiat
currency to buy the pack of sugar. (Rates are calculated in real time; the fiat currency
selected is the local currency.)
8.1. What is Pundi X Platform?
The Pundi X POS is a smart device that is built to distribute cryptocurrency and
is connected to the blockchain, so that each transaction is recorded. Consumers use
Pundi X POS to buy physical goods using cryptocurrency *
A software-only Pundi X POS is designed to run on Android and IOS tablets and
is a special purpose version of the consumer mobile wallet app.
Since each Pundi X POS device is connected to the web, software and feature
updates can be performed remotely. For example, an update may introduce new
blockchain features; schedule the sale of new ERC20 tokens; or arrange for a new
cryptocurrency to be issued through an ICO.
PUNDI&X&ICO                                                                                    15




* These purchases using Pundi X are carried out by first selling a fraction of a unit of
cryptocurrency and buying the local fiat currency first before using local fiat currency to
purchase items.
8.2. Targeted growth: 100,000 devices in 3 years
If the upcoming ICO reaches 35,000,000 tokens, our target for an installed base
of Pundi X POS devices is 100,000 over 3 years. Since these devices constitute a big
part of our cost, the amount raised during the ICO will determine device roll out
numbers. For example, if we double the amount raised, our network will reach
220,000  Pundi  X  POS  devices  in  three  years,  and  so  forth.  For  more  detailed
explanation please check Chapter 15.2.
Our plan is to address the global market by implementing an agent-partnership
model for markets where we cannot roll out our device immediately. Although our
focus remains to roll out our full stack hardware solution, our aim of upgrading the
current infrastructure (existing POS devices) globally will allow us to grow faster.
Looking beyond South East Asia, we will be forming these agent-partnership
models with the goal of introducing Pundi X POS devices in many other parts of the
world within the next twelve months.
PUNDI&X&ICO                                                                                   16

9. Pundi X Blockchain
Every Pundi X POS device is connected to the Ethereum and NEM blockchain
via XPlugins. As a result, each physical outlet is part of the Ethereum and NEM
blockchain and developers from all over the world can connect with the Pundi X
network of devices and physical outlets.
9.1 Pundi X Management Platform
The Pundi X Platform is a visual management system consisting of Pundi X
POS devices and other existing POS devices. Every common man can login to the
Pundi X Platform to buy or sell cryptocurrencies using the PundiX card and the Pundi-
Pundi wallet App. All transactions that are executed by the PundiX devices are
recorded in the blockchain for easy access and tracking.
9.2. Connecting stores with Pundi X
The target for Pundi X is to enable every POS device & retail store to be part of
the blockchain ecosystem. With the Pundi X Platform, we now have a cost-effective
approach to achieving this goal. Each device is connected to the blockchain using
PundiX Platform API  - XPlugins via two layers: the communication layer and the
PUNDI&X&ICO                                                                             18




blockchain layer. The communication layer delivers a  ‘buy’ request and uses the
blockchain  layer  to  make  a  record  of  the  sale.  This  information  is  then  stored
permanently in the blockchain. As a result, POS manufacturers all over the world can
now collaborate with Pundi X.
9.3. Selling cryptocurrency stores everywhere
We allow developers as well as cryptocurrency traders and holders to sell their
cryptocurrency via our sales network. Major Cryptocurrency and ERC20 tokens can
be accepted and sold on Pundi X POS and developers can use XPlugins to connect
to digital wallets, creating smart contract requests that can be supported by Pundi X
devices. The system automatically generates a smart contract in the Ethereum
blockchain after receiving orders from XPlugins.
9.4. Making payments using a digital wallet
All ERC20 tokens can be used to make payments at Pundi X POS device
locations. Developers can use digital wallets to connect to the Pundi X API and create
a smart contract for any individual merchant. Developers can even set different
transaction fees for different countries. Once a merchant approves a smart contract,
the  newly  accepted  cryptocurrency  can  be  sold  in  a  retail  outlet  enabling  the
purchase of everyday goods.
PUNDI&X&ICO                                                                                   19




9.5. Connecting to other Cryptocurrency Exchanges
Pundi X POS devices connects to different online cryptocurrency exchanges.
Since each online cryptocurrency exchange has a different bid-ask spread and price
level, users and merchants decide for themselves which platform best suits their
individual needs.
Users can choose their preferred cryptocurrency on various exchanges, and
the market will help determine which platform offers the best combination of price
and service.
PUNDI&X&ICO                                                                          20




10. Pundi X Token (PXS)
PXS  is  the  token  used  for  Pundi  X.  Token  purchaser,  crypto  traders,  crypto
developers and trading platform. They can also use PXS as “gas” to fuel transactions
in the Pundi X ecosystem. For example, people who want to use the Pundi X sales
network will have to buy PXS. As the Pundi X ecosystem grows, so will the demand
for PXS and the earliest token purchaser will stand to benefit most.
10.1. Supporting digital wallets on Pundi X
The Pundi-Pundi digital wallet app supports the Pundi X Wallet API; hence all
Pundi X features will be carried across to the Pundi-Pundi app. For example, using
the Pundi X Platform you can also buy on Pundi-Pundi.
In the future the Pundi X Wallet API will be connected to a wide range of digital
wallet apps. Many of our business partners’ digital wallet apps are in the process of
integrating the APIs. All of these digital wallet apps will enjoy the benefit of access to
the broad Pundi X ecosystem, including the ability to buy cryptocurrency directly
within the app.
PUNDI&X&ICO                                                                                  21




11. Progress to Date
Pundi X has been launched by the Pundi team which has already developed
highly successful digital wallet apps for South East Asian markets that have grown
rapidly to become some of Indonesia’s largest Pay-by-QR applications (think Alipay).
Pundi X is aiming to become cryptocurrency’s largest offline sales network -
(think  Walmart  or  7-Eleven)  providing  the  first  comprehensive  online-to-offline
cryptocurrency sales solution that includes:
- a decentralized sales network
- a multi-currency (fiat and crypto) wallet
- a decentralized trading platform
- a decentralized ICO platform
Pundi-Pundi is already one of Indonesia’s largest QR payment application
(think Alipay).
PUNDI&X&ICO                                                                               22




12. Roadmap
12.1. Pundi X Platform
We are currently identifying several channel partners to promote the Pundi X
Platform and PundiX Card. In this instance, we have identified the following
verticals:
1.  Existing POS Device Manufacturers - both hardware and tablet based (ex.
Verifone, mSwipe, Kounta, InHouse, etc.)
2.  POS Software Developers
3.  Crypto Exchanges (ex. Kraken, Bitrex, etc.)
4.  Crypto Cards (ex. TenX)
5.  Crypto Banks
12.2. Pundi X Banking
Approximately 73% of the population of South East Asia does not have a bank
account. In addition, tracking user credit ratings presents a major challenge without
a workable credit rating system and so bank loan approval presents many difficulties.
Consequently, Pundi X will collaborate with local financial institutions to create
an effective credit rating system by addressing the biggest challenges of privacy and
decentralized control by using blockchain technologies.
12.2.1.Challenges of storing credit data
Privacy is always a concern when it comes to storing data in the blockchain.
Also, the cost and performance of storage are both important considerations:   If all
the credit rating data generated by users was stored on the Ethereum blockchain
today, the system might not be able to handle all the necessary data processing.
12.2.2.Pundi X solution
To solve this challenge, Pundi X has an API suite that connects to the Ethereum
blockchain and stores user data in the blockchain in the form of a hash calculation.
The aim is to store all data indefinitely - including utility bills history.
Our approach is to store the hash results in the Ethereum blockchain instead of
all the credit data. The hash data can then be retrieved and validated in order to check
the full set of data stored outside of the blockchain.
By accessing the open database and calculating the results into a hash, Pundi
X partners can match their results with the hash that is stored in the Ethereum
blockchain: if both results match then identity and data-integrity is validated.
PUNDI&X&ICO                                                                                23




By avoiding storing all data in the Ethereum blockchain, we have developed a
cost-effective method that also effectively addresses privacy issues. Today, no user
data is stored in the Ethereum blockchain, only hashes. Financial institutions can now
retrieve credit rating data effectively and perform further calculations on their own
servers, while avoiding impinging on client privacy.
12.2.3.Pundi X advantages
Due to its successful growth, Pundi X has a wealth of transactions and other
data that is mapped to a wallet or blockchain address, while Pundi-Pundi has a
great deal of user data such as names, occupation and credit card information.
Together, Pundi X and Pundi-Pundi hold a huge data pool from which anonymized
information can be extracted responsibly in order create huge value. This is
something that other startups companies are not in a position to achieve.
PUNDI&X&ICO                                                                              24




12.2.4.The workflow of Pundi X
PUNDI&X&ICO                      25




13. Token Release
In this ICO, Pundi X will be issuing ERC20 compliant tokens with the ticker “PXS”.
13.1. PXS 3-year release program
We  accept  Ethereum  (ETH) during  the  ICO  and  the  basic  exchange  rate
between ETH and PXS is 1 ETH = 1666.67 PXS3 subject to holding for Three (3) years
(36 months) and fulfill the KYC requirement.  However, purchaser will only receive 500
PXS (30%) at the moment, the rest of the 1166.67 PXS (70%) will be entitled only if
the Purchaser holds for 3 years (36 months).   We will release the rest of the 70% of
the PXS token on a monthly basis. Therefore, purchaser who does not hold PXS for
36 months shall be penalized getting lesser PXS token.
In short, the Total receiving token is 1 ETH: 1666.67 PXS; The Initial receiving
token is 500 PXS, and the Locked token is 1166.67 Token subject to terms and
conditions.
13.2. Selling PXS on our platform
PXS is a key component of the Pundi X ecosystem. Any company or individual
that wants to connect to the Pundi X sales network will have to pay a transaction fee
in PXS. Hence anyone that wants to do business in the network will have to buy PXS
from the market.
13.3. The PXS discounts
As a token holder, when you shop at any outlet that supports Pundi X payments,
you will get an additional discount. Whether you are in Bali, Phuket, Bangkok, or
anywhere else in the world, you will receive significant benefits according to your

15. ICO
15.1. ICO details
Notes:
-   We accept ETH for PXS
-   Ratio of 1 ETH = 500 PXS
-   This ICO is not an IPO (Initial Public Offering)
-   Pre-ICO: Token purchaser can visit the Pundi X website before the ICO to pre-
register with their email address. Token purchaser will enjoy extra benefit based
on the pledged amount.
-   PXS amount: If this ICO does not generate 35,000,000 PXS tokens in sales, the
company reserves the right to use the remaining tokens for a second ICO. The
token  price  for  any  second  ICO  would  be  greater  than  in  this  round.  The
management reserves the right to terminate this ICO and, if this decision is taken,
all ETH fund will be returned to the original token purchaser.
15.2. ICO hard cap
Our hard cap will be 35 million US dollars. Regardless of how the price or
cryptocurrency changes, our target will be the same. The number of Pundi X POS
device distributed will be based on the number of tokens we are able to raise from
this ICO.
Total&ETH&raised                                                                        Number&of&POS&machine   Remarks

number(goes(up
The greater amount of funds raised from the ICO, the more Pundi X POS’s
production, installation, operation and marketing costs can be reduced. The device
numbers will also create a network effect where more people will use Pundi X POS
to buy and trade cryptocurrency, and more sellers will sell goods and services on our
sales network.
15.3. PXS release scheme
PUNDI&X&ICO                                                                             28




We  accept  Ethereum  (ETH) during  the  ICO  and  the  basic  exchange  rate
between ETH and PXS is 1 ETH = 1666.67 PXS4 subject to holding for Three (3) years
(36 months) and fulfill the KYC requirement.  However, purchaser will only receive 500
PXS (30%) at the moment, the rest of the 1166.67 PXS (70%) will be entitled only if
the Purchaser holds for 3 years (36 months).   We will release the rest of the 70% of
the PXS token on a monthly basis. Therefore, purchaser who does not hold PXS for
36 months shall be penalized getting lesser PXS token.
In short, the Total Receiving token is 1 ETH: 1666.67 PXS; The Initial receiving
token is 500 PXS (30%), and the Locked token is 1166.67 PXS(70%) is subject to
terms and conditions.
For simplicity, we will only show 1 ETH = 500 PXS on our official
website.
For this round, ICO token purchaser will hold 20% of the total PXS token
supply; while the founders, management, company, advisors and ICO marketing
expenses will together hold another 10%. (For details please see 11.6). The remaining
70% of the tokens will be released based on Proof-of-Stake to all token holders
including the founders, management, company, advisors and marketing campaign.
The system will release the rest of the PXS tokens based on the percentage of
the PXS tokens that a holder possesses immediately after the first month of the ICO
campaign. The entire release scheme will last for 3 years.
The system will determine the PXS tokens amount after the ICO, and based on
that we will be able to determine the precise PXS tokens released each month. Users
can login to our website to check the monthly PXS tokens released. The system will
release the tokens from the token pool.
When the entire remaining tokens are released, the PXS tokens will reach almost
100%, and the outstanding minuscule percentage will be distributed in the final
month.   We will announce the detailed PXS release scheme and the exact release
percentage each month after the ICO.
So how do we calculate?
If 35,000,000 tokens are created from this ICO, Alice contributes 1 ETH, which
she shall be entitled of  1666.67 PXS. She will receive  500 PXS by the time she
pledges, the rest of the 1166.67 PXS token will be released in the next 36 months.
On the first day of the 6th month after the ICO she will have over 763 PXS (500+263),
on the first day of the 10th month she will have 1013 PXS (500+513), on the first day
of the 16th month she will have 1268 PXS (500+768) ; On the first day of the 24th month
she will have 1500 PXS (500+1000); On the first day of the 36th   month she will have
4 The exchange rate might be varied from different discount rate.
PUNDI&X&ICO                                                                               29




1666.67 PXS (500+1166.67). During this period Alice will need to execute the smart
contract and fill in the KYC form as stipulated to unlock the tokens.
*  due to the fact that we will only be able to calculate the exact token distribution after the
ICO. The smart contract token distribution will be generated after the ICO to determine the
exactly monthly distribution amount. ICO token holders can visit our website for more
details or query the smart contract directly.
15.4. Release scheme implementation
From the 1st to 10th of every month, token holders can execute the smart
contract in any ERC20 supported wallet to know the exact PXS tokens from the
previous month. They will also be able to claim the bonus tokens based on the
monthly basis. Execution steps are as below:
A.  User executes smart contract in an ERC20 wallet and fill in the KYC form in
official website;
B. Release scheme starts on the second month after receiving PXS, user can
choose to execute the smart contract from any of the 2nd till the 7th month, in
order to receive the release tokens from the previous 1st till the 6th month;
C. Smart contract determines the number of tokens in an address from the
previous month (final day at 23:59), if the smart contract detects that user have
not claimed the release tokens for several months, it will then determines the
unclaimed released tokens of each month (final day at 23:59), and returns all
released tokens;
D. Tokens unclaimed more than six months will be forfeited. Each time a smart
contract is executed, the maximum release tokens are for a maximum of six
months;
E.  Calculation: determine the month(s) of PXS token counts of each month (final
day at 23:59) of an address, multiply by the month(s)   to determine the release
token numbers;
F.  On the last day of each month, Pundi X will activate a smart contract to
determine unclaimed bonus tokens over six months, unclaimed bonus tokens
will be announced and kept for further usage;
G. All times are GMT+8.
Note: The Release scheme will kick start from 1st December 2017. Token

15.6. Reserved PXS
Based on the number of tokens created during the ICO, we will create an
additional  portion  for  our  founders,  management,  company,  advisors  and  for
payment for ICO marketing expenses.
Assume in this ICO ‘A’ amount of PXS is created, the percentage of tokens will
be distributed for the additional portions are:
- ‘A’ x 25% to the founders and management;
- ‘A’ x 20% to the company, reserved for current and future employees;
- ‘A’ x 5% to the advisors and ICO marketing expenses.
- Reserved tokens will be unlocked at a rate of 10% each month.
Calculation:
For example after the conclusion of the ICO, if we have created 35,000,000
Tokens, the
reserved tokens created on top of the tokens from the ICO are indicated below:
- 8,750,000 tokens for founders and management;
- 7,000,000 tokens for company, reserved for current and future employees;
- 1,750,000 tokens for advisors and ICO marketing expenses.
