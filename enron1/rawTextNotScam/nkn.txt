(Dated: March 13, 2018                                                                                    Version:  1.0)
NKN  (New  Kind  of  Network)  is  a  new  generation  of  highly  scalable,  self-evolving  and  self-
incentivized blockchain network infrastructure.  NKN addresses the network decentralization and
self-evolution by introducing Cellular Automata (CA) methodology [1, 2] for both dynamism and
efficiency. NKN tokenizes network connectivity and data transmission capacity by a novel and use-
ful Proof of Work.  NKN focuses on decentralizing network resources, similar to how Bitcoin  [3]
and Ethereum [4] decentralize computing power as well as how IPFS [5] and Filecoin[6] decentralize
storage.  Together,  they form the three pillars of the Internet infrastructure for next generation
blockchain systems.  NKN ultimately makes the network more decentralized, efficient, equalized,
robust and secure, thus enabling healthier, safer, and more open Internet.

• Any node can connect to this fully open network
from any place
• Promote network sharing
• Secure net neutrality from network layer innova-
tions
• Always keep network open and scalable
• Perform efficient and dynamic routing

and changes its state accordingly [19]. Node state can be
