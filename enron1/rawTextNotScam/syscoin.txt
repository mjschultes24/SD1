Abstract—Syscoin  3.0  introduces  a  novel  implementation  of
a decentralized marketplace, an asset infrastructure, master-
nodes providing bonded validators for a PoW/PoS hybrid con-
sensus model and instant pseudo-interactive zero-confirmation
cryptocurrency transactions with double-spend protection.
1. Introduction
Syscoin  3.0  builds upon Syscoin  2.0[Sid] with addi-
tional  implementation  of  an  asset  infrastructure,  a  zero-
confirmation  double-spend  protected  instant  settlement
scheme, a hardened decentralized marketplace, and master-
nodes  providing  bonded  validators  for  a  Proof  of  Work
(PoW)  /  Proof  of  Stake  (PoS)  hybrid  consensus  model,
leveraging the blockchain’s immutability and audibility.
1.0.1. Z-DAG.    Z-DAG                                                               (Zero-Confirmation   Directed
Acyclic Graph) is an instant settlement protocol functioning
across  all  Syscoin  services.  Syscoin  services  consist  of
Alias  Identities,  Certificates,  Escrow,  Offers  and  Assets.
Each service is controlled via an Alias, in which ownership

incorrect state over time.To accurately detect double-spends,
other implementations such as Phantom[SZ] or Spectre[Zoh]
must use an algorithm to replace the longest chain rule to
derive the order of events and attacker sequences in a graph.
These implementations end up in a more complex game-
theoretical situation that has not mathematically been proven
to be accurate in all cases. Syscoin relies on the thoroughly
tested Nakamoto consensus model to arrive at a consensus
over time rather than simply relying on a DAG.

ownership of tokens.
Sending  allocations  of  an  asset  involves  the  Z-DAG
protocol to allow for real-time point-of-sale applications in a
token to service model. The sender would send the receiver
some tokens and receiver would in real-time detect double-
spends within roughly 10 seconds. This provides a way for
the receiver of a micro/low value transaction to be ensured
that it is statistically likely that their funds will confirm
on the network, and that the contract between sender and
receiver can complete.
For efficient operation of non-fungible tokens  (tokens
that  track  ownership  individually  like  the  UTXO  coin
model) we developed a way to store the ownership of these
tokens as input ranges. Input ranges represent a range of
ownership tokens that an asset or an alias identity owns such
that when transferred or received it will split and merge the
ranges respectively.
SA  ⊇ SB
Let SA  be the superset range of inputs of the sender and
SB  the strict subset inputs range being sent to the receiver.

1.3.5. Multiple payment options. Syscoin offers the di-
rect  conversion,  transfer  and  ownership  of  hundreds  of
cryptocurrencies today. The Syscoin marketplace will allow
offer payment via the complete set of coins by adding an
abstraction layer converting coins to Syscoin upon purchase
and locking the Syscoin in escrow as part of the normal
offer purchase flow. Native support can be for any coin
that supports the same private key and signature scheme
format as Syscoin does; this allows client-side conversion
from the native Syscoin address to the desired address such
that the same private key can unlock payments in the other
supporting blockchains where the private key can be used to
sign off on spending those coins. Direct support for Syscoin
and other Assets will work differently. Instead of sending
money to an address, an Asset transfer would happen be-
tween identities since Asset transfers use the identity as
input instead of coins.                                               Figure 5: Data anchoring infographic

1.8. Escrow
Syscoin’s integrated escrow service allows safer pay-
ments of offers by securely holding a buyer’s tokens in
escrow until the terms of the sale are met and the buyer
releases payment to the seller.
The system uses an arbiter-based system, whereby ar-
biters act as trusted third-parties between buyers and mer-
chant for a sale in the decentralized marketplace. An arbiter
is paid based on a dynamic fee set in the rates peg for the
offer that is sold. Once the escrow process is complete all

arbiters  and  buyers  that  any  disputes  would  be  quickly
and efficiently resolved. Arbitration and insurance would
become cost-effective means to insure true buyer protection
as markets form as a result of the technology. There is
currently  a  proof-of-concept  under  development  for  this
proof-of-shipment mechanism.
We are working on the ability for autonomous agents to
act as escrow agents and deliver goods to buyers within
5km  of  distribution  centers.  The  food  industry  employs
such services. We would simply adapt these to allow for
a decentralized marketplace with tokens held in escrow that
would be released upon acceptance of delivery.
5.4. Syscoin 4.0 - Next Generation
The next generation of Syscoin will focus on scalability.
Work has begun on creating a platform for enterprise grade
applications done in a permissionless blockchain environ-
ment. A public blockchain that serves as the backbone for
a merkle computer[Rou] is the ideal case for subsequent
economic development to rely upon without central actors
to dissuade others from performing for the most efficient
common goals for an economy. The ideal system would
allow for an EVM implementation to run such that the
Patricia  Trie  states[Fou].  The  accounts  would  be  stored
in a scalable, permissionless blockchain running on mas-
ternode technology. They would also be performing side-
chain Syscoin transactions to get in and out of the EVM
environment  through  the  help  of  Intel  SGX  or  merge-
mined sidechains. The computation would be run either as
a quorum or with the help of hardware protected execution
environments, so that single random or dual random nodes
are all that would be needed to perform calculations for
