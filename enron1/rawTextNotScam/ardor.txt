Chains.

door to conducting seemless transactions with fiat
over the blockchain. Furthermore, the existence of
multiple child chains pegged to different external cur-
rencies will allow users to trade them for each other
using the Coin Exchange functionality, effectively using
Ardor as a decentralized foreign exchange  ("forex")
platform.

The financial and banking sectors have undoubtedly been in the last
years some of the most eager industries to embrace the advantages
of the blockchain technology. Cross-border transactions, mirror
accounts, trade finance, money transfer, digitalized payments and
insurance tracking can all benefit from the distributed and trustless
nature of the blockchain. Ardor, being written in Java, scalable and
secure, is the perfect choice not only for the above-mentioned use
cases but also, thanks to its rich functionality, for asset and securi-
ties issuance, management, trading, and dividend payments.

Simply put, the Nxt developers know what there are doing and they always deliver on their promises. I've
followed the team since the early beginning of Nxt’s existence and the project has advanced the abilities of
secured decentralized applications tremendously. Nxt is also a green blockchain technology and I like this. I'm
totally staggered. The Ardor platform is the natural expansion of Nxt where blockchain scalability is addressed.
Contrary to the Bitcoin scaling solution currently on the table, Ardor's solution improves the global decentraliza-
tion of the network instead of reducing it. The ideas of multiple fully featured child chains is also extremely wel-
comed as this increases the synergy around the Ardor platform. Sincerely, you got to take a deep look at this seri-

I love that the tech has been working without a hitch since the beginning. That track record is unusually good.
But the great community of Nxt is really above all else what kept me around. The altcoin space in general is very
toxic and full of spammers (see BitcoinTalk). I imagine that got especially developer-types attracted, that then
spawned a lot of good projects off- and around Nxt. The use case for the child currencies is so perfect for busi-
