I. Introduction and Concept
1.  The Emergence of a Data Revolution
Blockchain protocol has revolutionized the way the world looks at data storage mecha-
nisms. Specifically, P2P networking helps achieve this decentralized distributed consensus
by combining the advantageous appliances of blockchain and P2P design. With that, a
new era of data management and financial asset storage sprouted and came to life. With
the creation of the first blockchain digital currency, Bitcoin, in early 2009, many researchers
and like-minded visionaries recognized the potential of independence that this technolo gy
holds.
With the concept of centralized organizations controlling operations from digital com merce
to financial industries, it is evident that in a world of growing and ambitious indivi duals,
these types of organizations hold threat to the advancement of both the world and the way
social structures are molded.
Throughout history, it is seen that all centralized entities have their downfall as social struc-
tures advance and humanity progresses. Leaving the power held to a select few to deter-
mine the future of evolvement of humanity is the exact reason why blockchain P2P networ-
king was created.
Aside of common known centralization problems, lack of privacy adds a second issue, not
only to traditional financial systems, but to cryptocurrency transactions as well. Financial
privacy has become a rare and valued commodity; purchases performed via credit cards
and bank transfers are monitored. It is possible to determine a lot about one person by
analyzing spending habits. Sensitive financial information is currently being stored in
systems that are highly vulnerable to being compromised.
As Bitcoin came to solve some centralization problems by providing the liberty of
transacting with others without third parties involved, it has not, however, been able to
provide complete financial privacy as transactions can still be linked to individuals.

2.  Objectives and Purpose
NIX aims to grant the means and resources to empower people across the world to
achieve independence in their social, economic, and global structure. These assets span
from financial security and freedom to private data management and even social content
autonomy.
The key issue within the blockchain and cryptocurrency realm in the present is user inte-
gration. Although the technology has been battle hardened to an extent, real world de-
velopment and use case is little to none. The adversity that NIX aims to solve is bridging
that problem and empowering elements to create ecosystems with a specific use case. In
order to achieve this, NIX is adopting multiple privacy mechanisms, scaling solutions, smart
contracts integration, sidechain utilities, and ease of use towards the end consumer speci-
fically in speed and environment.
The NIX protocol offers layered optional privacy that is enabling people to create a me dium
of communication and dApps between blockchain channels, for whichever purpo ses each
channel stores.
3.  Intra And Interoperable Privacy Platform
NIX is being built to establish an ecosystem of asset distribution with the added power
of privacy. To achieve this, the initial design targets a series of strong intra-chain privacy
elements, like the NIX Ghost Vault and 2-Way Ghosting, to first make NIX a powerful
privacy based coin.
To deliver the above mentioned features, NIX has created a personal privacy library named
the NIX Ghost Protocol, which is using the mechanisms of Zerocoin privacy proofs, paired
with one-time integrated Zerocoin addresses. This is also combined with a Tor network
that offers   OBFS4 bridging and communication. All elements from networking privacy to
blockchain privacy are offered.
Along with the Ghost Protocol, an atomic swaps infrastructure is being developed to allow
private transactions among different chains. This layer focuses on chain-to-chain private
transfers via NIX Platform.

4.  Privacy Features Overview
The NIX Ghost Protocol consists of several privacy elements that will be conti nued to be
built on top of. NIX platform has enabled Zerocoin coupled with Tor networking. Zerocoin
helps scramble user data by creating a system that makes it impossible to guess the correct
ori ginal location of assets. Integrated with a layering of Tor networking, users have both
blockchain privacy as well as networking privacy. The use of Bulletproof integrations will
keep being researched and developed into the NIX Ghost Protocol, yet is not available on
mainnet release.
Based on the Ghost Protocol, NIX developed its first privacy solution, NIX Ghost Vault.
This feature provides full one way privacy to either the sender or the receiver and allows
users to completely hide coins from the chain.
Apart from NIX Ghost Vault functional feature, NIX has crafted the first in history privacy-
in-one-transaction development: NIX 2-Way Ghosting. This innovative development
allows users to transfer their private coins from one vault to someone else’s vault. To enable
2-Way-Ghosting, NIX designed and implemented Commitment Key Packs. Commitment
Key Packs allow for an address-less blockchain payment protocol which has never been
done before utilizing Zerocoin.
These privacy features are explained with details in the present document.
5.  NIX Multi-Layered Scheme
NIX is a multi-layered privacy currency which utilizes an interoperable platform model
to fuel privacy focused decentralized applications. By definition it covers 4 main layers:
Protocol Layer, containing the consensus mechanisms and privacy protocol design;
Utilization Layer, which includes tools and features like the Ghost Vault and 2-Way
Ghosting; the Communication Layer, accounting for interoperability between chains; and
the   dApp Layer which extends to dApp development and use cases such as the DEX
Manager.

II. Protocol Layer
1.  Proof-of-Stake consensus
The objective of a cryptocurrency security system is to ensure that remote processes arrive
at the same conclusion in perfect order, this is known as consensus among nodes. All nodes
in the network must record every single transaction, which is achieved by the consensus
protocol.
NIX Platform employs Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism to secure the network, validate
the blockchain and allow the emission of new blocks. NIX holders (stakers) act as nodes
that account for the execution of those tasks; as a result, their voting power on the network
validation process is proportional to the amount of NIX coins they stake and thus their
staking reward frequency.
Proof-of-Stake technology complements NIX’s core value of decentralization, as mining
monopolies that manipulate blocks become abolished and it does not involve the creation
of new units of money.
2.  Optional NIX Ghost Protocol Privacy Model
The superior privacy layer that NIX offers solves many concerns in the cryptocurrency eco-
system. Because NIX believes that users should have the power of privacy, it is not a re-
quired feature, simply an optional one.
With zero-knowledge proof elements for concealing transaction and data movements along
with the Zerocoin Protocol and Commitment Key Packs scheme, the NIX privacy protocol is
the most robust and mathematically secured cryptocurrency system.
The construction of the privacy mechanism follows that of a slightly modified Zerocoin se-
tup still utilizing the RSA and Discrete Logarithm system for a zero-knowledge proof setup.
For the Zerocoin parameter generation, NIX creates a scheme that has 4 checkpoints. The
initial layout is the Setup parameter, followed by Mint, Spend, and finally Verification. The
two factors that are modified for the construction of the NIX model focus on the last two
elements, Spend and Verification.
Initially, a setup parameter is designed in order to create an accumulator environment
with prime numbers p and q such that   p = 2ωq + 1 for ω ≥ 1. At this point, the random
generators created still maintain the zerocoin relation and there are no modifications in this
nixplatform.io

section. The mint parameter follows where outputs from the setup mechanism are used to
create a zero-knowledge proof which helps verify ownership of a Zerocoin on the network.
Now comes the spend parameter which takes the output of the mint to create a witness for
the supposed solution. On the NIX Network, the output from the spend is then sent to a
one-time-address on the network which is only communicated with the prover of the zero-
knowledge proof. On the NIX chain, a spent Zerocoin outputs to a NIX that is sent to an
address that can only be accessed and viewed by the receiver and payee. Since the payee
is the Zerocoin accumulator in this instance, privacy is key between the receiver/user only.
This process works as follows: the transaction is created and is sent to N’, where N’ is the
equi valent to a NIX public key paring hashed with a one-time-address. In this case, N’
is displayed as a NIX one-time-address on chain that has no link to real NIX addresses.
Because of this, Zerocoin can essentially be created and spent right away via a one-time-
address platform since monitoring these outputs can only be decoded between the
receiver/user. This does not affect the verification parameter for our trustless Zerocoin setup
as the signature of knowledge is not affected by this method. Peers are still able to verify
the signature of knowledge with the known public parameters.
Now poses the issue of monitoring peers which commit Zerocoin transaction to the
mempool. Because there is a possible way for an attacker to monitor a user’s interaction
and transaction process via the networking in the P2P network, Tor networking allows
obfuscation with no exit nodes which provides a networking trustless setup to prevent
against these attacks, TOR is en abled by default in the NIX platform setup. Proof-of-Stake

2.1.   Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Zero-knowledge proofs are proofs that show a statement to be true without revealing
anything other than the veracity of the statement to be proven1. They are particularly
effective in fields like secure communication, privacy and authentication.
By definition, a zero-knowledge proof must satisfy the following three properties:
Completeness, the high-probabilistic opportunity that if the part A is telling the truth, the
part B is being convinced that part A is telling the truth. Soundness, the fact that part A can
only convince the part B if it is telling the truth.   Zero-knowledgeness, the fact that the part
B does not learn anything about the part A’s knowledge.
NIX Platform uses zero-knowledge proofs to help anonymize transactions; in detail, they
allow NIX to obfuscate information of transactions on the public blockchain network.
2.2.   Zerocoin Protocol
To solve the dilemma of anonymous transactions, Bitcoin and preceding alternative crypto-
currencies have attempted to use transaction mixers or ring signatures. However, there are
a number of drawbacks to these proposed solutions. For one, a malicious or compromised
member of a mixer or ring signature can break privacy. Furthermore, the anonymity set is
a key metric to understanding how private a currency is. Privacy in formerly proposed so-
lutions is limited by the size of the mixing cycle or ring signature. Each mixing cycle or ring
signature is controlled by the number of transactions per cycle, which is transitively limited
by the block size of the currency. Thus, the anonymity set in previous attempts at privacy
tends to only be a few hundred transactions.
The Zerocoin Protocol is a strong encryption system in which large prime numbers are
multiplied and the factorization of the resulting number makes it impossible to find out
which numbers   are used2.
With Zerocoin, the anonymity set is on a dramatically higher magnitude. Instead of having
it limited to the few dozens, the NIX network, with the use of Zerocoin has an anonymity set
that en compasses all minted coins in a particular RSA accumulator that can scale to many
thou sands, and -unlike other solutions- it is not subject to transaction graph analysis.
2.3.   Pedersen Anonymous Deposits: Commitment Key Packs
The introduction of zero-knowledge commitment schemes using Zerocoin Protocol
techniques allows for anonymous coin mixing on a blockchain which enables coin history
destruction and full parameter privacy. Currently, Zerocoin is enabled as an intra-layered
nixplatform.io

protocol for individual clients on a P2P blockchain network. The NIX network proposes a
solution that expands the isolated zero-knowledge scheme towards a commitment key pack
solution that allows third-parties to conduct in direct zero-knowledge payments resulting in
an address-less blockchain payment protocol.
As a soft-fork implementation, a new key scheme can be created which manages and tracks
Zerocoin Pedersen commitment values for direct public deposits. To understand how this
does not compromise any parameter information from peer to peer, NIX breaks down the
Zerocoin payment layout as follows:
To create a Zerocoin Mint, several private parameters are used in order to generate the
single public parameter that is shared to the network. A random private ECDSA key is
created with every single Zerocoin Mint object, in turn a pairing public key (P) is generated.
The public key is then RIPEMD160 hashed into a serialized object to create (S). Finally, NIX
Platform then generates a large random number (R) that is used to compute the Pedersen
Commitment (C) for the Zerocoin through use of RSA-2048 as the modulus commitment
group. The one public parameter that is now serialized and transmitted through the network
is the Pedersen Commitment (C).
NIX created a key scheme called Commitment Key Packs that allows packing of Pedersen
Commitments to act as one-time-key formats for Zerocoin Deposits. Through this, NIX
can conduct full blockchain privacy payments without the need of using any group-
able addresses on chain and instead conduct transactions using only zero-knowledge
commitment schemes. A Commitment Key Pack creates a simpler environment for clients
to manage one-time payment locations. By default, Zerocoin works as a fixed denomination
payment model, and because of this, each individual Commitment Key can only accept one
deposit. The purpose for a Commitment Key Pack is to allow a key format to group commit
schemes to permit peers to conduct multiple zerocoin transactions at once.
Flexibility: This privacy model requires a partial interactive payment setup between peers.
Because keys are one-time usable, providing the same key to multiple payees is not
accepted, therefore a custom Commitment Key Pack should be provided to each payee.
Verification of the payment can be monitored in an offline manner, yet ownership of the
payment cannot be verified offline.
Scalability: A drawback to this current model include lengthy and unfriendly key
formats. Because this payment protocol requires a partial interactive payment setup, the
encumbrances of lengthy keys do not pose a major issue, yet this could be mitigated in
the future by enabling sender-receiver parameter calculations. This could be done by
compromising one of the private parameters such as the random number (R) used to
calculate the Pedersen commitment (C) to be calculated instead by the sender. In this case,
the receiver only needs to provide a Commitment Key Pack which packages the public

key hashed values which are much smaller in length. Another design that could be used
to lessen the key length is integration of bulletproofs to introduce reduction of proof sizes
which will directly affect the Pedersen commitment size in turn the Commitment Key Pack.
Both these solutions are being looked into further.
Design: To allow for flexibility in the key scheme, the design of a Commitment Key Pack
reflects the following encoding format.
Base61(C0 + ... Ci + 0xFFFF(eokp) + CSize0(1byte) + ... CSizei + checksum(4bytes))
A 4 byte eokp (end-of-key-pack) identifier is placed at the end of the grouped commitment
keys, followed by respective sizes in single byte increments followed by a 4-byte checksum.
This allows keys to be created based on any amount of Commitment packings which allows
for flexibility in one-time payments, however big they may be. A 10-packed amount is
enabled by default, nonetheless simple parameter changes can modify it in the base client.
Implementation: Because Commitment Key Packs do not work like standard key pairs,
it is necessary to continually scan each block for a direct match. However, no strenuous
calculations are made to determine whether or not a payment has been successfully
transferred, so the check can be made in O(1) time which in turn adds negligible time to the
blockchain sync process.
When a localized Zerocoin is created currently, the Zerocoin data is written to the wallet
database which is then used to provide the ZK proof on Zerocoin spend verification.
However, Commitment Key Packs differ in that the ZK proof information is instead stored
on a separate wallet database that is used to either generate packs for payments, or to scan
each block or transaction to verify ownership.
With Commitment Key Packs being an interactive payment model, simple SPV wallets can
be dedicated to hosting the one-time-keys associated with these payments. To determine
if an existent paid Commitment Key Pack is eligible to redeem on the blockchain, only
two factors must be known, the public commitment scheme, and the serialized private
coin information. With these two parameters, a light wallet does not need to sync with the
entire blockchain, and instead, only needs to create a data structure that holds total public
and private redeemed commitment schemes on chain. This can be an extremely light
performance based process, and broadcasting payments to the network does not require
pre-existing blockchain history.
Benefits: There are many factors that could potentially break a user’s privacy on a single
blockchain. Commitment Key Packs create an environment of privacy that cannot be broken
by any external parameter. One privacy failure could be IP linking through node transaction
transmission, which can help group and identify transactions made by certain nodes to one
nixplatform.io

owner. A work-around for this would be to use Tor/VPN and/or Dandelion. The issue here
though comes when a transaction is funded from multiple change addresses, linking the
owner and previous blockchain history rendering the Tor/VPN and/or Dandelion useless. To
be almost 100% private on all ends of a transaction, a user would always need to make sure
proper networking and blockchain privacy is managed; this could add inconveniences to
the process of transacting on a specific blockchain network. With Commitment Key Packs,
there is no need for any networking privacy since transactions cannot be linked to public
any UTXO sets. Theoretically, if a user only conducts transactions using Commitment Key
Packs, there could be no way of compromising his/her history.
Conclusion: NIX Platform has proposed a full parameter private address-less blockchain
payment protocol which can be integrated through a simple soft-fork. The benefits that this
payment model can offer, outweigh any encumbrances in its current state. This protocol
not only enhances user privacy on a single blockchain, it also simplifies any layer-2 solutions
utilizing privacy mechanisms.
2.4.   Bulletproofs Integration3
Bulletproofs is a zero-knowledge   proof integration of creating confidentiality. The outlying
solution which Bulletproofs bring is designing a trustless setup that creates transaction
output privacy for users whilst highly reducing transaction size.
This protocol runs on very short proofs and without a trusted setup; the proof size is only
logarithmic in the witness size. Bulletproofs are especially well suited for efficient range
proofs on committed values. This technology brings a significant improvement to the
cryptocurrency ecosystem regarding proof size.
Bulletproofs is based on the notion of confidential transactions introduced by Maxwell
in order to address the confidentiality of the amounts. To enable public validation, the
transaction contains a zero-knowledge proof that the sum of the committed inputs is
greater than the sum of the committed outputs, and that all the outputs are po sitive,
namely they lie in the interval [0,2n], where 2n is much smaller than the group size.
As a consequence, Bulletproofs increase in size only logarithmically with the number of
outputs and size of the range’s proof, as a result, the size of transactions get reduced
significantly. This implementation can turn into huge space savings, faster transactions and
incredible space savings.
Bulletproofs technology application is being studied to be incorporated to the NIX Network
as a scaling solution.

2.5.   Tor Anonymity Network
Tor is a software that enables the ability to conceal user location and usage from outside
monitoring entities. When using Tor, a user’s networking is routed through thousands of
different network relays to scramble initial internet traffic resulting in a secure system for
networking. Tor is a default networking tool enabled in the NIX Network.
2.6.   Dandelion
The integration of Dandelion to the NIX Network provides an additional level of privacy by
way of concealing the IP address of a user broadcasting a transaction.
When a user (A) wishes to transfer funds to another user (B), A   generates a transaction
message that includes some of   his/her information: the quantity of funds transferred, the
prior transaction from which these funds are drawn, and a reference to B’s pseudonym. The
system-wide sequence of transactions is shared and broadcasted to the nodes that the
network is connected to and recorded on a public blockchain in a very fast manner4.
Considering the current node’s communication protocol and given the wide propagation
range of user’s information to many nodes, it can be inferred that, if several conditions
are reached, the IP address that conducted the transaction could be discovered, thus
compromising user’s privacy.
Dandelion modifies the communication protocol among nodes by implementing 2
processes called: stem phase and fluff phase. The stem phase changes the traditional
model of broadcasting a transaction to all nodes at once, instead it gets communicated
from node to node. Each time a node receives a stem-phase transaction from another node,
it either relays the transaction or diffuses it, which brings the second phase.
Once this information has been shared from node to node, the fluff phase reconfigures the
communication mode back to traditional system, i.e., all connected nodes are informed
about the transaction. As the nodes that originally shared the information in the stem phase
do not do it in a public way, it highly decreases the probability of finding the user who
conducted the transaction.

3.  NIX Ghostnodes
NIX Ghostnodes help to ensure dedicated network processing for Ghost Protocol
transactions. Any smart contract based element that requires autonomous privacy
processing relies on the NIX Ghostnodes to fulfill that request. Maintaining and running
a NIX Ghostnode is a decentralized process in which users need to obtain 40,000 NIX
coins to run. By holding these NIX coins in ‘G’ addresses and following Ghostnode
setup procedures, the network uses nodes to dedicate power for NIX Ghost Protocol
transactions ensuring no bottleneck in the computing com ponent of each privacy element;
in return, each Ghostnode is rewarded as follows: a.) There is a 0.25% fee awarded to NIX
Ghostnodes through any Ghost Protocol transaction enabled by smart contract elements,
which is a small charge to pay for decentralized priva cy that also includes atomic swaps. A
small charge to pay for decentralized privacy. And b.), NIX Ghostnodes additionally earn
partial block rewards of around 70% per block.NIX Ghostnodes

III.  Utilization Layer
1.  NIX Ghost Vault
NIX Ghost Vault is a privacy feature based on the Ghost Protocol that makes user’s coins
completely private from the chain. This element uses Zerocoin to conceal transaction
location with one way privacy: either for the sender or the receiver.
This is the first Ghost Protocol privacy solution as it allows users to mint NIX coins,
essentially making them disappear with no previous history and permitting the user to
decide when to spend their coins leaving no traces for NIX.
Ghost Vault functioning is similar to a Zerocoin accumulator which privatizes location
Zerocoin Mixing. NIX are not directly stored in the Vault, as they are first minted into
zerocoins by the implementation of the optional privacy Ghost Protocol. As this system
works similar to an accumulator by combining everyone’s minted zerocoins, what is of public
knowledge is the number of zerocoins there are on it, therefore there is no way to identify
which coins belong to each user, which in turn results in complete anonymity. The overlying
feature of the Ghost Vault is the more users and volume going in, the greater the privacy set
for everyone utilizing the Ghost Protocol.
nixplatform.io
14 / 23




With this feature, each user is able to send coins to their Ghost Vault which then hides the
locations of those coins. Sending coins to the Ghost Vault is called “ghosting”, this process
is fully private for receiver, as the destination is a hidden location, yet the sending address
is public and identifiable. Sending coins from the Ghost Vault is called “unghosting”, here
the sending address, represented by the vault   is private, giving sender privacy, yet the
receiving address is public.
As the Ghost Vault uses the Ghost Protocol, it generates fees to Ghostnodes when
users conduct public to private payments, so 0.25% of the coins stored into the vault
is distributed among nodes as a form of income for backing the private transaction.
Commitment Key Packs scheme transactions (Zerocoin to Zerocoin payments) are feeless.
1.1.   Ghosting and Unghosting
Zero-knowledge proofs are created whenever a public NIX coin is ghosted which is then
serialized into a format for specific transaction inputs and outputs. The specific format for
these deployments are as such:
For a NIX coin being ghosted, the NIX Network utilizes the OP_ZEROCOINMINT opcode
which enables peers to read and store the transaction script as a zerocoin into the networks
accumulator:
Vin:
Public NIX coins
Vout:
CScript() <<
OP_ZEROCOINMINT <<
pubCoinValueSize <<
pubCoinValue;
This is a simple storage of the Zerocoin model that was created when NIX coins were being
destroyed and ghosted. With this, the network communicates that there has been a NIX
coin destroyed, and in turn a zerocoin has been made.
For a ghosted NIX coin to be unghosted from its zerocoin format, NIX Platform utilizes
the OP_ZEROCOINSPEND opcode which enables peers to read and validate the zerocoin
spend script as it attempts to convert a zerocoin into a NIX public coin. The specific format
for these deployments are as such:

Vin:
CScript() <<
OP_ZEROCOINSPEND <<
serializedCoinSpendSize <<
serializedCoinSpendProof;
Vout:
Public NIX coins
Here, the zero-knowledge proof to the original Zerocoin is attached to the transaction for
the network to validate. This entire process allows the destruction and recreation of NIX
public coins in two steps.
2.  NIX 2-Way Ghosting
To enable full transaction privacy between sender and receiver, NIX Platform introduced the
2-Way Ghosting mechanism, which is based on our Commitment Key Packs scheme.
2-Way Ghosting adds the ability to mint new zerocoins when unghosting and deposit them
into receiver’s Ghost Vault.
This brought NIX Platform towards enabling the faculty to launch powerful private smart
contracts on chain while allowing end-to-end Zerocoin private transactions, a never-done
before implementation.
2.1.   Application
For being ghosted, NIX coins go through the Ghost Protocol which destroys NIX and
converts them into zerocoins. The vault represents a cryptographically secured place where
those zerocoins are stored and become impossible to trade from the chain as they get
mixed with other user’s zerocoins.
Once in the vault, coins can be transferred to two different locations. The original format is
then sent   to a public NIX address. Meaning zerocoins are unghosted and thus converted
into new NIX. As the receiver is a public NIX address, those NIX can be traced throughout
the blockchain, therefore they are no longer private.
To eliminate one way privacy issues, NIX employs a Key List containing customized one-
time-keys (Ghost Keys) based on the Commitment Key Packs scheme; they can be found in
NIX core wallet and are used to unlock zerocoins.

The receiver must provide the sender with one Ghost Key, and now, instead of ghosted NIX
being sent to one public address, they are converted into new ghosted NIX, sent to a Ghost
Key and progressively to the receiver’s Ghost Vault. As it can be noticed the whole process
is performed without involving public addresses and without compromising user’s security
as once a Ghost Key gets used it gets burnt.
3.  NIX Ghost Vault Staking
NIX Platform is planning the incorporation of Ghost Vault staking so that users keeping their
coins private in the vault do not miss rewards.
This feature, aside of keeping coins private, is capable of increasing NIX Platform privacy
set as it incentivizes users to stake their coins in the form of Zerocoins directly from the
Ghost Vault.

IV.  Communication Layer
The purpose of this layer is to incorporate different platforms, allowing them to build on
the NIX Network to access various blockchains in a privacy agnostic fashion. The cross-
chain atomic swaps infrastructure that is being built on NIX plays an important role in
this ecosystem, not to mention that privacy is the key factor to be provided within this
interoperability infrastructure.
1.  Inter-Communication Model
The creation of an inter-communication model within the NIX environment points multi ple
elements. The utilization of privacy centered smart contracts allows for dApps to fill the
space for inter-chain communication protocols.
Branching outwards, the NIX architecture proposes the creation of any chain-to-chain com-
munication layer to use the privacy metrics that NIX offers. Not only NIX provides value in
its own financial ecosystem, it also consents utility in a smart contract privacy system. NIX
aims to allow users to lock the network required consensus for a chain-to-chain creation.
Essentially, when a user wishes to create a dApp that operates within the NIX dominion,
the initial fee for creating on the platform entitle users to deposit NIX into a network
distributed address, this address fulfills agreement requirements in the establishment of the
communication model.
2.  Sidechain Model
The integration of a sidechain ecosystem in NIX offers users, developers, and businesses
the opportunity to create and attach their own networks to the NIX network. The purpose
that sidechains aim to achieve within NIX is to create a framework that permits network
customization without requiring a change in the NIX core protocol. This plays a big role in
NIX’s direction at solving supply chain management through blockchain.

V.    dApps Layer
The dApp layer consists of decentralized applications running on top of the NIX Network
utilizing NIX’s unique privacy protocols. DApps economize digital resources providing a way
to monetize what has previously been very difficult to do. The NIX dApp layer provides the
option of full privacy for all of these digital assets utilizing NIX privacy protocols.
The first case of a dApp in the creation of NIX ecosystem is the bridge between DEX
platforms in delivering a privacy layered system to privatize atomic swaps. The DEX
Manager looks forward to solving privacy layers among DEX trading while also connecting
all joined DEXes allowing for much greater amounts of liquidity.
1.  Initial Use Case Adoption: Private Decentralized Trading
To demonstrate an important aspect for the financial world in cryptocurrency, NIX is targe-
ting the creation of the first privatized decentralized exchange manager.
On traditional markets, a trusted third party is required for users and traders to engage and
trade currencies through an escrow. Many times throughout the evolution of cryptocurrency
trading, this trust has been abused and traders/users have been taken advantage of. The
use of atomic swaps eliminates this issue, and the process for a NIX privacy swap is simple.
By integrating several DEX platforms, NIX Platform allows for the exchange of one cryp-
tocurrency for another without the need of a trusted third party.
This system creates a layer of privacy for any protocol and tradeable asset through a
multi-tiered trading structure. NIX seeks to bridge communication within external DEXes
to create priva cy elements among all and any compatible ecosystems. The progressive
incorporation of more DEXes is allowing NIX to achieve this system unification, permitting
direct development on each protocol in a streamlined fashion as a prompter integration is
developed.
To trade coin A for coin B via the NIX platform, there are several steps that take place to
ensure that when a trader receives coin B, the swap is untraceable and private. The privacy
process to swap coin A for coin B works on both routes: Coin A and B are mutually traded
for NIX. This is possible with any decentralized exchange protocol that gets integrated into
the NIX Platform.

NIX Ghost Protocol transactions are conducted by means of the NIX Ghostnodes ensuring
an anonymous and private trade. Once the coins are privatized and beco me untraceable
on the network to their origin, they are in turn traded for Coin A and Coin B and sent to
the respective traders. Finally, the initial Coin A owner holds Coin B amount which was
generated from the Zerocoin anonymous transaction that the NIX network created. Same
for the Coin B owner. All coins are then traced back to the NIX trade that it used, and since
the NIX coins hold no prior record, there is no historical trace of the atomic swap, creating a
privacy layer for atomic transactions.
NIX Ghostnodes work to accomplish these consensus requirements. Any integrated DEX
communication model is handled between NIX Ghostnodes on the NIX Network. With
the NIX consensus system utilizing Proof-of-Stake on chain, NIX Ghostnodes are used
to approve and fulfill cross chain protocols. The use of NIX Ghostnodes generates an
automation of network priva cy for these created ecosystems.

3.  NIX Network Future
NIX’s final goals are to provide full privacy and decentralization, so we are moving forward
towards those goals by delivering privacy-based solutions that are the foundation of NIX
Platform’s use case and by moving to a more decentralized ecosystem, one in which any
developer can build on top of.
The NIX Network forsees the future as follows: Having Utilization Layer applications being
widely and promptly implemented as well as accomplishing private trades between chains,
which encompasses NIX’s Communication Layer goals.
Subsequently, the network looks forward to the launch of NIX’s DEX Manager as the first
dApp Layer solution. This is intended to become a user friendly application that, as a
privacy tool, executes transactions among different DEXes.
Ultimately, NIX’s purpose is to become a completely decentralized project, where no main
teams nor development funding are needed, instead, having several teams that work on
different areas to update the core code whilst offering tool kits for other developers to
create their own dApps using NIX’s privacy utilities.
