What Is Blockvest?
Blockvest is the use of blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, the use of smart contracts
for digital assets to be self-managed, to achieve a “smart economy” with a distributed network.
Blockvest (BLV) is an ERC20 token based upon the Ethereum blockchain.  Operating on the blockchain allows
for global accessibility, 24/7 trading, transparency, public verification of Blockvest’s holdings and no expensive
legacy banking fees.    At it’s core, Blockvest, found online at Blockvestico.io,  is a utility token that’s
representative of the top performing cryptocurrency index. The initial tokens can only be acquired during the
Initial Coin Offering (ICO)  which is a one off, closed-cap offering. The tokens provided will represent a
participant ’s share of the portfolio. Thirty percent of the total amount contributed during the offering will go
directly towards buying the underlying index cryptocurrencies
Blockchain Investments issues tokens built on a profit-sharing smart contract. The company is proud to introduce
the Token-As-A-Fund business model, which allows investors to subscribe to the fund’s income stream. To
monitor the current reserves of the fund and the fund’s value, a self-certification system is included so
shareholders can monitor their investment at any time. Performing daily self-certification of funds in conjunction
with monthly external audits will ensure transparency and trust between BLV fund managers and shareholders.
Blockchain Investments offers multiple open-end investment funds also known as Digital Asset Arrays or
Bespoke Blockpools as well as our core product a Decentralized Blockchain Based Assets Exchange ran on The
BlockVest Network of Nvestnodes. Blockchain Investments helps its clients create passive income from Blockvest
Nvestnodes. Nvestnodes are similar to bitcoin mining but are much more efficient use of the network and are
much less complex. Nvestnodes have some crucial additional functionalities which give them more utility than
Bitcoin. Utility is a primary driver of value for cryptocurrencies. Blockvest connects collateral holders with people
who require low volatility, which creates an incentive-based market for stability. Collateral holders are rewarded
when users transact in the stablecoin, compensating them for staking the system.
Overall, Blockvest consists of a decentralized ecosystem that facilitates a stablecoin. Stablecoins are a
cryptocurrency designed specifically for price stability.
Blockvest has created a decentralized Ecosystem, built on a stablecoin capable of capturing all the benefits of a
permissionless system while also eliminating volatility.
Blockvest aims to solve one of the biggest                                                                              problems of trust and custodianship. The BLV token is a novel
decentralized asset, whose intrinsic value is derived from the fees generated in the network it collateralizes as
well as the right to receive quarterly earnings from the performance of the Blockchain Investments Fund. This
enables a form of representative money in which there is no requirement for a physical asset, thus removing the
problems of trust and custodianship.
How Does The Blockvest Ecosystem Work?
Blockvest aims to solve another big problem in the cryptocurrency industry: Volatility. Holders of Blockvest will
be able to issue a secondary token denominated in US dollars. This will lock the value of the stablecoin to the
USD.
Here’s how it works: those who use the stablecoin pay fees to those who collateralize the network through
holding Blockvest inside an Nvestnode Wallet, compensating them for the risks of providing collateral and
stability. Through this system, collateral providers control the money supply, and fees are distributed based on
each individual’s stabilization performance. Blockvest uses this system to reward those who supply stability
while charging those who demand stability. The end result is a balanced stablecoin ecosystem.

Blockvest achieves this structure using two linked tokens:
Yield
Yield is the stablecoin of the Blockvest platform. The supply of the stablecoin floats. Its price as measured in fiat
currency should remain stable. The token is designed to function as a superior medium of exchange. Therefore,
in addition to price stability, Blockvest should encourage adequate Yield liquidity.
Blockvest
Blockvest is a token that provides collateral for the system. It has a static (unchanging) supply. The market
capitalization of Blockvest reflects the fund, platform and exchange’s aggregate value. Ownership of Blockvest
tokens grants the right to issue a value of Yields proportional to the dollar value of Blockvest placed into escrow.
If a user wishes to release their escrowed Blockvest, then they must first present the system with the quantity
of Yields previously issued. Blockvest tokens are being released through Global ICO in Q4 of 2018 & our Global
IPO in 2019. Our Pre-IPO “Testing the Waters” Phase is live now.
The intrinsic value of the Blockvest token comes from the fees generated in the network it collateralizes. This
creates a form of representative money in which there’s no requirement for a physical asset. This removes the
problems of trust and custodianship. Basically, BLV token holders will receive transaction fees according to their
stability contributions to the network and transactions processed within the BlockVest Decentralized Exchange.
Initially, the Yield (YLD) stablecoin will hold its value relative to the US dollar. In the future, however, the
company may support additional types of stablecoins.
Benefits Of BLOCKVEST
Why do we need a stable coin? Overall, the goal of Blockvest’ dual token system is to create passive income as
well as a stablecoin that can be used as a reliable store of value for international money transfers, payments and
remittances. Some of the specific benefits include:
•    Trading on a decentralized exchange
•    A unit of account for prediction markets
•    Funding token sales
•    Overseas remittance
•    Online retail transactions
•    Secure store of value
Ultimately, cryptocurrencies have enormous value and potential. However, few investors are comfortable
putting their whole net worth into cryptocurrencies. One of the biggest concerns people face is volatility.
BLOCKVEST aims to solve that problem in a unique way. For more detailed information on the Blockvest
Platform, Decentralized Exchange or Ecosystem I would encourage you to take a look at the BlockVest
Presentation Found on the Learn More button on our ICO website.

Blockvest Analytical & Management Interface
The Blockvest Interface provides tools for investment portfolio structuring and management as well as a holistic
view of the available investment opportunities and the fund’s historical and current investment performance.
The interface allows the investor to:
• Analyze and pick investment opportunities from the list of options that are available on the Blockvest Crypto
Platform.
• Structure the investment portfolio and allocate capital to desired assets.
• Track the portfolio performance.
• Drill down to get the decomposition and verify the investment results.
• Submit tokens for buyback to participate in the distribution of the fund’s income.
• Download reports and export necessary analytical data.
This investment interface will be based on the institutional grade investment interfaces created by Blockchain
Investment Group.
Blockchain Investments seeks to provide investors a regular stream of income while preserving capital to the
maximum extent possible. The fund trades the following instruments in its portfolio basket: cryptocurrencies,
tokens, digital assets, Fintech, ICOs, leasing, mining, tokenized real state, tokenized gold, tokenized energy,
online trading and new technologies.   Blockchain Investments limits sub-account size in order to secure the
fastest most liquid trades as is possible thus realizing safe gains with extremely low volatility.
Here’s the process broken down in a step by step way:
Step 1) Greg participates in the token sale, sending 10 ETH (worth $10,000 USD) to the smart contract
Step 2) The token sale closes, and the value of the Blockvest collateral pool is established, with each Blockvest worth $1.00
Step 3) Greg receives 10,000 Blockvest tokens at the end of the sale
Step 4) The system only allows 20% of the value of Blockvest to be issued as Yields, which means there’s a buffer of 80%
against price changes; this is called the “collateralization ratio”
Step 5) Greg escrows her Blockvest, and 2000 Yield Stablecoins worth $1 USD each are deposited into the Yield pool
Step 6) Greg’s Yields are sold by the Blockvest system for ETH, and the ETH is deposited into Greg’s wallet
Step 7) Another party, Bob, purchases Yield and sends them to his friend Carol; during the transfer, a small transaction fee
is collected by the Blockvest system and sent to Greg and other BLOCKVEST holders

Blockvest design goals: Smart Economy
Blockvest is the use of blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, the use of smart
contracts for digital assets to be self-managed, to achieve a "smart economy" with a distributed
network.
Digital Assets on the Blockvest Blockchain
Digital assets are programmable assets that exist in the form of electronic data. With blockchain
technology, the digitization of assets can be decentralized, trustful, traceable, highly transparent, and
free of intermediaries. On the Blockvest blockchain, users are able to register, trade, and circulate
multiple types of assets. Proving the connection between digital and physical assets is possible through
digital identity. Assets registered through a validated digital identity are protected by law.
Blockvest has two forms of digital assets: global assets and contract assets. Global assets can be
recorded in the system space and can be identified by all smart contracts and clients. Contract assets
are recorded in the private storage area of the smart contract and require a compatible client to
recognize them. Contract assets can adhere to certain standards in order to achieve compatibility with
most clients. Our goal at Blockvest was to create our own Blockchain to Model Neo’s and Ethereums
but still compatible with both platforms.
Bespoke Blockpools & Digital Asset Arrays: ln a constant pursuit to remain financially Innovative
minimizing risk exposure to our investors remains a top priority. We are partnering with NEM, ICONOMI,
Bancor, Waves, PRISM and Melonport an Ethereum asset platform, to build experimental Digital Asset
Arrays (DAA). DAA’s are comprised of various combinations of digital assets. Each manager can create
his own assortment of specific digital assets and offer them to the Blockvest community.
Benefits of DAA
Because DAA can consist of as many underlying digital assets as you want, they are a perfect vehicle to
achieve your goals. DAA can be either diversified to maximize value stability, or fine-tuned to
aggressively pursue maximum gains.
Lower the Risk Of Depreciation
The new economy moves at lightning speed, so the value of digital assets can fluctuate rapidly. Making
a DAA of several digital assets can lower the risk of depreciation.
Maintain an Optimal Digital Asset Mix
Easy array adjustments enable constant reaction to the markets for optimal growth.
Attract Supporters & Split the Profits
Invite others to support the Blockvest DAA Ecosystem and share proceeds through our referral bonus
program.

The Power of Indexing
Index funds have consistently outperformed actively managed funds since their inception. For the 12-month
period ending May 2016, investors poured more than $375 billion into index funds. One reason why index
funds outperform other funds is due to their low annual fees. Blockvest has an annual fee of only 1% whereas
competing crypto offerings have fees of 3% per year. All crypto offerings built on one of the many recently
launched fund platforms will apply their fees over and above those of the platform. Blockvest index fund can
offer such low fees because it is independent and automated. Index strategies are a set of rules that an
algorithm can act on with no human intervention required.
We believe it takes an inspired team to build something big, so we make sure every single member of our staff
loves blockchain as much as we do. We are humbled to have truly outstanding software engineers, data analysts
and money managers on the team; unified by our mission to build innovative products in one of the most exciting
industries in the world.
Blockchain Investments uses a proprietary trading strategy for trading all asset classes. The strategy uses
variations of mean reverse, pattern recognition and Supply and Demand. The strategy employs risk modules to
be able to keep drawdowns to a range of 6% to 15%. Blockchain Investments targets returns between 12% to
25% per annum with a Sharpe ratio of above .5.
The BLOCKVEST (BLV) ICO Token Sale
The BLOCKVEST token sale is scheduled to go live in December of 2018.
