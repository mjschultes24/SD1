1  Abstract
There are many challenges originating from both cryptocurrencies and traditional banking
system. These challenges prevent wider adoption of cryptocurrencies and whole world to
benefit from cryptocurrencies. These challenges would only be overcome if the perception of
people changed, which is almost impossible as a solution. The other option would be to
implement a solution which would become a real connector between these two functional
systems, offering benefits that will make processes related to each ecosystem easier, cheaper
and more beneficial to participants.
HubrisOne, is a mobile application designed to completely revolutionise the dynamics
between the cryptocurrency and the banking sector. At present there is little to no trust between
traditional banking and cryptocurrency users. We plan to fuse traditional banking with
cryptocurrency, and deliver the related services to the masses through an open, honest and
fully trustworthy infrastructure, which is easy to use and easy to understand by new entrants
into the cryptocurrency market and veterans alike.
The HubrisOne team is introducing a functional utility token known as the Hubris Token
(HBRS), which will be used within the HubrisOne app and infrastructure, as a store of value,
a way to transfer funds, receive platform access, discounts and used as a form of payment in
conjunction with the HubrisOne debit cards.
There is a vast market opportunity which is not dominated by any new solution. We are
offering easy and affordable banking solutions to the 2 billion unbanked people around the
world.
There is a robust business model established depends on several revenue streams such as,
membership fees, crypto-backed lending services, and open partner marketplace.
As you read through our whitepaper, please note that the following information is based on
services and solutions we are certain of bringing to market, and these are not just ideas, but
well thought-out researched actionable tangible services. The app illustrations you see are
copyrighted and are actual screen shots of our upcoming proof of concept.
We appreciate your time and interest taken to read our whitepaper.




2  Introduction
HubrisOne, is a cryptocurrency wallet and traditional fiat bank account combined into a powerful,
intelligent, regulated and compliant digital mobile application. We are focused on merging the benefits
of these two powerful industries, seamlessly.
We have designed HubrisOne to be easy to use, secure and intelligent. HubrisOne is more than just a
digital cryptocurrency friendly bank account. It is a realistic and innovative approach to banking and
cryptocurrency utilization together.
2.1   Our Vision
Our vision is to bring the benefits of traditional world of finance and banking and the new world of
cryptocurrencies together in a new, secure, regulated and user-friendly way.
There is a need for a regulated, trusted and licensed go to solution that will help new investors to adopt
into the cryptocurrency market, whilst still maintaining the importance of their trusted banking system
they use on a daily basis. We know that current banking system has plenty of improvement points. We
might improve their current processes and services on offer by leveraging the technology such as
blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
We aim to become the world’s first cryptocurrency friendly digital bank, fully complaint and regulated
within the United Kingdom.
Just imagine, your day to day banking facilities, accounts, and cryptocurrency wallets side by side.
Banking made digital, secure and cryptocurrency friendly.

3.1                                                                                                     Challenges Caused by the Infancy of Cryptocurrency Market
Due to its infancy the cryptocurrency market is facing many significant issues, including
but not limited to;
•   The lack of global financial inclusion (CGAP, 2018)
•   Lack of a full end-to-end, on ramp and off ramp platform for new investors into the
cryptocurrency market.
•   Unregulated services and solutions such as exchanges, derivatives and indexes and other
investment derivative investment linked products (TechCrunch, 2018)
•   Price volatility and manipulation (CNN, 2018)
•   Lack of trust, transparency and Fraud (HBR, 2018)
3.2                                                                                                     Viewing Cryptocurrency Differently From Fiat Currencies
Most of the people in traditional finance space believe that cryptocurrencies will not be around in
the future. On the contrary, most of the cryptocurrency enthusiasts believe the opposite.   We see
the market evolving and developing to find a fair-balanced middle ground between the two form
of currencies as noted above. Therefore, it is most probable that cryptocurrencies and fiat
currencies in the future will operate as one overarching option of global currency, with each having
their own use case.
If cryptocurrencies are to be taken seriously by the world and for mass adoption to be achieved,
we need to legitimise cryptocurrencies through a trustworthy, secure and regulated medium,
channel or solution.
3.3                                                                                                     Recognising the Role of the Banking System
Most of the cryptocurrency enthusiasts are against the banking system with a subjective approach.
An objective and realistic analysis of to the existing banking systems reveals the fact that it plays
important roles in our lives.  Global banking system has been established, built and trusted for over
200 years. This 200-year old banking industry has its pitfalls, however, it is important to emphasise
its significance, access and opportunities it has given (BBA):
•   secure payment networks that keep the world’s economy moving 24/7
•   Providing financing and access for people to buy their dream homes, cars or holidays
•   Allows billions of people each day to pay for goods and services on and offline
•   Has provided millions of jobs globally
•   Pays millions of salaries everyday
•   Moves billions of payments everyday globally
3.4                                                                                                     The Cryptocurrency World Needs a Bank
Recently, the world and the cryptocurrency community has witnessed a severe backlash from
traditional banks, payments processors and credit card companies banning customers and users from
buying, investing or transacting in any cryptocurrency related businesses (Forbes, 2018).




3.5                                                                                                    Complacency & Poor Customer Service
Only 23 percent of customers globally believe their bank is meeting their expectations, according
to a newly released survey of 9,000 bank customers in nine countries by FIS, a banking and
payments technology company (FIS, 2015).
Banks globally are failing to meet their customer’s expectations; however, customers do not have
or know of any alternatives they can switch to due to the monopolistic nature and copy-cat offerings
each bank presents.
Below are a few issues and examples banks place on to their valued customers, not limited to the
following:
•   Old fashioned and outdated verification systems - up to 20-minute wait times
•   Lack of new and innovative communication channels - no live chat
•   Slow and outdated payment systems
•   No payments processed on the weekend
•   Unnecessary fees for overdrafts and missed payments
•   Long wait times for a new card or pin number
3.6                                                                                                    The Banks: Extortionate Global Exchange Fees
When you are sending money to a different location and you transfer money the banks can charge
you up to the purchase is in a different currency, the banks can charge you up to 13% on each
transfer. The greedy and unfair part is they could give you the inter-bank FX rates whereby your
fees are reduced by up to 98% to 100%.
Here’s an excerpt taken from (TD, 2018)- which captures the above problem perfectly.
“So let’s say you are moving countries and you sold your house in one country and bought in
another. $200,000 house, transferring from London to New York, or from Sydney to San
Francisco. How much do you pay the bank when you wire the money? You might be shocked
to discover that the fees are as high as 13%.
That’s on a round-trip exchange, meaning if you changed the money then changed it back you would
lose 13%. Ofccourse you’re not going do a round trip exchange, but it gives you the idea of how
much the banks are making. The average fees are around 7% round-trip or 3.5% one way.
This means that on your $200,000 house you just paid $7,000 to the bank to transfer the money for
you.”




Below you will find a table that displays the add-on fees banks commission on each of your transfers
you make.
Additionally, to the above we find the following issues are very prevalent and need to be disrupted:
Our research and market analysis suggests the majority of people are unhappy and are unsatisfied
with their bank for various reasons, ranging from, but not limited to:
•   Fees being too high
•   Lack of quality customer service
•   Significant inefficiency
•   Lack of innovation
•   Greed and not being customer-centric
3.7   High Competition in Customer Acquisition
Acquiring and retaining profitable customers is an ever-growing challenge for banks. It is apparent
that customer demographics, buying behaviour and needs are evolving rapidly, and have accelerated
even more with the introduction of cryptocurrencies.
The competition is aggressive and adapting rapidly. Traditional banks now need a 360-degree view
of each customer in order to focus their resources efficiently (BoC, 2017).




4  Solutions & Value Propositions
4.1   Instant Digital Bank Accounts

merchants.
4.2   International Transfers using Stellar Blockchain

their HubrisOne bank account using secure blockchain payments, this brings many benefits
never seen before in the banking industry, such as:
•                                                                                                    Real-time traceability and tracking of funds, you'll know when and where your transfer is
at all times
•                                                                                                    International payments using the Stellar blockchain Connectivity across international
banking payments networks
•                                                                                                    An instant on-demand settlement, when you transfer with faster payments or SEPA (usually
within 2-4 hours)
A key feature of the HubrisOne app will be the ability to conduct traditional and blockchain
international payments. Users will be given the option of transferring funds to bank accounts
via SEPA, SWIFT or Faster Payments or send via Stellar’s international blockchain payment
technology.




Why Stellar?

and non-blockchain service providers and to increase and improve our scope of service offerings.
Connecting great services and solutions to willing customers, users and investors.
Think about a comparison website when you are traveling or when booking a hotel. This is a similar
structure and concept that would be applied. These additional services can and only will be available
to Hubris Token holders.
4.10 Secure Contactless Debit Card
Multiple accounts, one card. Within a few taps
you can connect your debit card to your bank
account,  cryptocurrency  wallet  or  set  your
account to auto-spend from a nominated account.
We’ve simplified each step and made it seamless
to connect users to the world of cryptocurrency
and the traditional world of banking.
Users cards come fully loaded as you would
expect from your bank plus more:
•    Contactless payments
•    Spend where the VISA logo is accepted
•    Secure with 24/7 account monitoring




4.11 The Growth of Smartphone Usage and Unbanked
The growth of smartphone usage aligns with our growth plans and direction of developing an app
only digital banking solution which is lightweight, secure and accessible. In saying this, there are
over 2 billion unbanked adults who do not have access to the banking infrastructure that we take we
granted.
According to Statista, the number of smartphone users is forecast to grow from 2.1 billion in 2016
to around 2.5 billion in 2019, with smartphone penetration rates increasing we see a general global
shift to mobile-only digital solutions and banking is an area that is due for a digital shake-up
(Statista, 2016).
4.12 Helping Cryptocurrency Adoption
The HubrisOne app will increase the adoption rate through our cryptocurrency integrated digital
banking accounts.
By presenting a familiar banking solution with cryptocurrency integration, we will slowly increase
adoption and gain users at the same time
By enabling our target
market to execute their
day  to  day  banking
operations   from   the
HubrisOne   app   and
providing  easy  access
to  the  cryptocurrency
market   infrastructure,
we  provide  a  simple
vessel for users to adopt
cryptocurrencies
exponentially.

5.1                                                                                                 The Market Opportunity: How Big is the Global Market?
The market for the HubrisOne app and digital banking solution is vast and an extremely attractive
market.
Firstly, we are offering a digital banking solution to people who meet the following criteria:
•   Have a smartphone with internet connection with access to Apple App Store or Google
Play
•   Have or need a bank account.
•   Over 18
Note: The above criteria has been simplified for illustration purposes, but already, the
evidence is apparent that our solution is a mass market product and applies to the mass
population, which already shows the potential demand of the market we are targeting.
According to the WSBI, over 37 million individuals do not have a bank account within the
EU. The EU will be the first regional hub HubrisOne will launch (WSBI).
On the contrary, over 430 million individuals have a bank account within the EU. The above
two criteria are our target market we will focus on upon launch of HubrisOne.
A combined 467 million target opportunity in the EU alone.  Additionally, we have identified
over 2 billion global unbanked adults which will be our secondary target market. HubrisOne
appeals to the mass market, however we have further segmented this market in order for  our
focus to not be too wide. Hence our proposition is      cryptocurrency-banking, cryptocurrency
first and compliant and regulated banking solutions second.
5.2                                                                                                 Customer Acquisition Strategy
We will implement three key customer acquisition models which will generate revenue to
cover costs, increase cryptocurrency adoption and increase the rate of customer acquisition.
Our customer acquisition model is a simple yet effective strategy. Many of our future users
and customers will be acquired through the following three key acquisition strategies. We
ensured that  the  cost  to acquire was significantly lower than  the future revenue and
monetization potential each customer would bring.
We will be focusing and are implementing three strategic customer acquisition channels:
Freemium                                                                                            Model
HubrisOne will offer basic digital current accounts services for free in addition to other
services. However, a fee will be charged per month for additional premium services.




By giving away the basic product for free it is easier to attract users and create a strong
customer base. Some key benefits we see are: Customer acquisition, marketing effect via
word of mouth and network effect, the more people that use HubrisOne the more people it
will attract.
Hubris Token Reward for User Sign up
The second key strategic
acquisition  channel  we
see  as  being  effective
and                                                                                                 significant   is
leveraging   the   native
HubrisOne
cryptocurrency   tokens
(HBRS)  which  will  be
used as a reward (among
other   uses)   for   each
customer  that  signs  up
with HubrisOne.
By rewarding users to sign
up with our Hubris Token, we incentivise and reward new users to join and share. This will
increase the rate of our customer acquisition, and significantly increase the growth rate of our
customer base via organic network and marketing effect.
Partnerships & Third Party Open Platform
The third key strategic acquisition channel we see as being effective and significant is creating
and building an open platform for third-party blockchain and non-blockchain services.




Creating an open platform for non-conflicting third-party services and solutions we:
•   create a revenue stream via commissions and on-boarding fee.
•   we create awareness of blockchain services thereby increasing adoption
•   we increase the scope of services we provide indirectly without increasing the cost of
having  to  offer  these services  directly.  Partnerships  will  be key and  we are  in
discussions with key players in financial services, insurance, and retail.
5.3                                                                                                          Competition & Differentiation
We are aware of competing solutions which offer similar or fragmented digital banking
solutions. However, we are yet to identify a solution which offers the same offerings as
HubrisOne. Upon analysis we find the market is in it’s infancy and our value propositions have
been tailored to our primary customer segment.
Below you will find three potential competitors, now and in the future:
•   Wirex
•   Revolut
•   TenX
Note: There may be smaller competitors, however we have not identified them as serious
contenders for the cryptocurrency and digital banking market. These smaller competitors have
been identified as: MinexPay, ViaBuy
Although we have identified there are competitors, we have mapped out the market ad
understand that our solution differentiates significantly.
5.4                                                                                                          Revenue Generation & Sustainability
Customer Acquisition Analysis: Years 1-5
Below you will find details and data points regarding our customer acquisition within the first five years
of operation. We have based these predictions on real, tangible, relevant data points. We have used
Revolut’s growth rate in the past two years as a base standard. Revolut in some respect can be identified
as a potential competitor of HubrisOne.
The data below has been adjusted to reflect the following:
•   The infancy of HubrisOne
•   Lack of brand awareness of HubrisOne
•   Proof of concept only and no working product
•   New cryptocurrency solution and a relatively new market
According to (CNBC, 2017), Revolut was signing up and acquiring over 3,500 users every single day. As
mentioned above we will not use the same growth and acquisition rate due to the reasons mentioned
earlier. We will apply a 50% reduction in customer acquisition growth. See below for our estimates,
analysis and predictions for HubrisOne.
Customer Lifetime Value
Our customer lifetime value, is a simple equation - (current revenue - cost to acquire, projected
over the customer lifecycle).       However, it is very difficult to measure in today’s changing and
always evolving business context. We’ve simplified the above formula to apply to the estimated
customer acquisition, number of paid users over a predicted 17 years LTV (life time value cycle).




A new study suggests that the average time a customer remains with a bank is 17 years (Gaurdian,
2013). We will use this as our foundation to generate a customer lifetime value based on 30% of
our acquired customers being premium paid users.
Upon launch and through the development of HubrisOne we will establish the perfect
monthly fee to charge users per month for our services. The above is only analysis to illustrate
the potential of our targeted market over a five-year period without factoring in growth,
inflation and others.
HubrisOne Membership Breakdown
For  the  purposes  of  this  descriptive  whitepaper  we  have  decided  to  focus  solely on
membership fees which will form the backbone of our revenue and sustainability model.
See below for our proposed membership model. Free and Premium, with each having their
target customers and benefits.




5.5   Marketing Channels
We have identified our user base and customer segment to be digital natives, so it only makes
sense for us to focus heavily on digital marketing channels. As a full digital banking alternative
our focus is to use analytical tools to effectively target and acquire customers. Our digital
marketing campaigns will be the building blocks or actions within your strategy that move us
toward our short-term and long-term goals.
We will focus on social media and digital marketing channels, with zero print or television media. The
following channels is where we will be focusing our efforts:
•   Google Adwords
•   Instagram Influencers
•   Twitter Ads
•   Youtube Ads
•   Instagram Ads
•   Facebook Ads
•   Quora Ads
We have divided our strategy by deeply segmenting our target customer by the following criteria:
Quantitative (or Demographic) Information
•   Location
•   Age
•   Income
•    Job Title
We will utilise the following three forms of media in conjunction with above social media
channels mentioned, HubSpot has provided a short summary on what each type of media
provides.
Owned Media
This refers to the digital assets that your brand or company owns -- whether that’s your website,
social media profiles, blog content, or imagery, owned channels are the things your business has
complete control over.
Earned Media
Quite simply, earned media refers to the exposure you’ve earned through word-of-mouth.
Whether that’s content you've distributed on other websites (e.g., guest posts), PR work you’ve
been doing, or the customer experience you've delivered, earned media is the recognition you
receive as a result.
Paid Media
Paid media is a bit self-explanatory in what its name suggests -- and refers to any vehicle or
channel that you spend money on to catch the attention of your buyer personas.
Marketing will be extremely significant for us and as a result we have dedicated over 20% of
funding to marketing alone.

11 Conclusion
Cryptocurrency space does not need fastest blockchains, flawless dApps, shortest settlement
times or lowest fees to proceed to the next level. It only needs wider adoption to achieve that.
Current phase of cryptocurrency ecosystem is not mature enough to replace traditional systems
or processes. It is in its’ infancy.
It  is  not  realistic  to  expect  cryptocurrency to  replace  fiat  currency.  On  the  other  hand,
cryptocurrencies will not disappear or become idle. In order to achieve wider adoption of
cryptocurrencies, we need a solution which, respects and identifies the importance of the
traditional banking system and the benefits it provides, however at the same time, removing the
greed, unfairness in exchange fees, removing the inefficiencies such as physical branches and
call centres - whilst at the same time improving the customer service, product innovation,
technology and becoming more customer centric.
Banks have been enabling the tradition to continue globally, letting everyone to have their dream
belongings, helping everyone to receive salaries, etc. These are a few significant benefits and
real-life examples of what banks provide to the mass population on a daily basis. We recognise
the importance of this and at the same time we understand the issues banks have created globally
through greed, lack of transparency and complacency.
In order for the market to mature and to increase mass adoption we need to promote freedom and
autonomy over people’s own finances. The solution is not to abolish banks, or financial
institutions or to overthrow them with the rise of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, but the
solution is to merge and marry the benefits from both of these powerful worlds.
We feel there is a strong need for an all-inclusive, end-to-end banking and cryptocurrency
solution. Not only will HubrisOne open more doors for cryptocurrency adoption, HubrisOne will
allow users and investors to use one solution for all of their banking needs, today and more
importantly, in the future. This is banking for the cryptocurrency generation.
It’s about time we move this industry into the future and whilst we're doing this, HubrisOne is
bringing banking into the digital age, and we've future-proofed it with the integration of
cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.
The above key pain points are our main focus, including cryptocurrency integration. We see a
spectrum wide problem with banking today and this is where we believe the opportunity is. We
want to incorporate a customer centric, innovative and trustworthy application that welcomes
your feedback.

A1- Regulatory Compliance & Company Jurisdiction
We are legally registered with companies’ house in the UK company number: 11529615.
Our choice for registration within the United Kingdom was a careful strategic decision which we
took after careful consideration, the reasons and rationale for this choice are as follows:
•                                                                                                    Firstly,  the  UK  alongside  the  United  States  has  the  most  advanced,  innovative  and
established global banking infrastructure in the world.
•                                                                                                    Secondly, the UK government is very open-minded with respect to cryptocurrencies and
blockchain technologies.
•                                                                                                    Thirdly, the United Kingdom has great protectionism over banks, financial institutions which
favour the customers, this means our customers funds will be protected under the FCSC
scheme (FSCS, 2018).
•                                                                                                    Lastly, the United Kingdom along with other EU countries are supporters of digital banking
innovation and disruption hence the introduction of the electronic money licence regulation
(2011), which we will be leveraging through our card partner upon launch (Europa).
The above decisions were considered, among others, when deciding where to register and create
our company. HubrisOne is a trading name of HubrisOne Technologies Ltd.
HubrisOne will be authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) through our UK card
issuer as an authorized agent, under the e-money institution license. Thereby granting access
HubrisOne EEA passporting permissions to all 31 EU countries in the EU. The introduction of
the e-money license and the regulation is to allow and spur innovation in a safe and controlled
way.
The Electronic money (e-money) is a digital alternative to cash. It allows users to make cashless
payments with money stored on a card or a phone, or over the internet. The reasons this license
was introduced is primarily for such services such as HubrisOne and many others to flourish and
capture market share from traditional banking operators. EU rules on e-money aim to:
•  facilitate the emergence of new, innovative and secure e-money services
•  provide new companies with access to the e-money market
•  encourage effective competition between all market participants
