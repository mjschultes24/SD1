The purpose of this document is to provide information 
regarding Vector, the ICO and VCTR coins, its core 
conceptual idea, functional model, competitive advantages, 
token offering details and roadmap towards the 
actualization of our projected roadmap.

A more technical description of core architecture and APIs 
will follow soon after.

After condensing the original concept into a pitch 
presentation, we relentlessly reached out to interested 
partners and organically built our team. Along this journey, 
we found great partners and mentors strongly committed 
and excited to work with in fine tuning our vision and 
refining our proposal for the market.

Introduction

Now that we drive towards the token offering stage, we 
thank everyone that supported us and hope to surpass the 
expectations of the community in the future.

This white paper will be published on its current revision, 
and we recommend following updates on our website and 
other media channels periodically, for new information and 
updates.

I upgraded my trading tier like a month ago. It’s still 
pending. I’ve contacted support a couple of times. They 
have replied that they are working on it but after time 
goes by nothing ever happens. They are really slow on 
customer support atm... Just a heads up.

”

They are so slow it is unreal. took them 3 weeks to send 
a copypasta email telling me i had missed a corner on 
my  ID  in  the  photo.  Like  seriously  3  weeks  after  i  had 
sent them several messages.

”

I’m  locked  out  of  my  account,  and  it  has  taken  almost 
two months to make any movement on it. A short “we’re 
sorry  its  taking  so  long”  message  comes  in  every  3 
weeks or so. Just terrible. I should send them a bill for all 
the money I’ve lost just waiting to be able to access my 
account. Never again.

”

I  couldn’t  agree  more.  ______  has  terrible  customer 
service  and  their  app  is  shit.  I’ve  been  trying  to  get  a 
deposit resolved for 4 weeks now, and each time I write 
into support it takes a week + to response if they respond 
at all.

”

Abstract

________ has had numerous issues in recent months. 
Complaints of slow loading speeds and trade executions, 
drastic  slippage,  and  errors  while  attempting  to  log 
in  during  critical  periods  of  high  volatility  have  been 
widespread.

”

________, ____, ______, and ________ all experience 
difficulties  during  the  same  period,  resulting 
in  a 
significant number of traders having found themselves 
locked out of their accounts.

”

______ is seriously the worst exchange. Slow as shit, orders 
sometimes execute twice, can’t get any orders to sell or buy. I 
thought ___ was one of the worst until I tried ______.

”

I’ve been dealing with their shit customer service for so long 
I finally gave up. Trust me, you’re lucky you had this problem 
before you put money into their scam exchange

”

Concerned: I have been unable to withdraw my funds from 
_______ for close to 2 months

Mission Statement

“

To create a user-friendly and easily accessible mobile application for cryptocurrency trading, to 
foster a community of innovative and world class cryptocurrency traders, and to establish a customer 
service team that handles all requests in a world class manner. ”

Our Vision
Vector  is  a  revolutionary  platform  that  brings 
together the best and most promising features for 
cryptocurrency trading.
Our  sole  objective  was  to  develop  a  unique 
technological solution that allows the integration of 
the best crypto currencies to be traded all around 
the world simultaneously.
All of these features would make for an outstanding 
product on its own right, the first-of-its-kind in the 
world of crypto currency exchanges and one that 
could  be  funded  by  venture  capital  investment 
alone.
But we decided to go a step beyond, and wanted to 
offer the chance for anyone in the world to become 
a backer, leveraging the power of an Initial Coin 
Offering (ICO).
This is an ambitious endeavor intended to build a 
comprehensive platform from the ground-up, while 
bringing tangible value to our backers.

We  believe  cryptocurrencies  are  evolving 
to 
become much more than speculation and are here 
to stay in the minds and wallets of consumers.
We will be opening our ICO sales on on December 
8th, 2017, intended to observe community interest 
in our project.
After the round closure, and if it exceeds our soft 
cap, the funds will fuel our passion with the platform, 
financing  development,  evangelistic  campaign, 
marketing  operations  and  team  expansion.  If  it 
doesn’t match, we`ll refund all contributors.
What we achieved so far is the result of the efforts 
of a diverse and highly-skilled team, targeting our 
ambitious  roadmap.  At  this  stage,  we  need  your 
support.

Lack of mobile exchanges

“

One day in the Crypto world is like one week in the normal world. ”

The cryptocurrency financial market is the fastest 
growing and fastest moving financial market in the 
world.  However  oddly  enough,  Cryptocurrency 
trading still lives on the desktop. Neither Bittrex, 
Gdax,  or  Kraken  have  dedicated  mobile 
applications for trading (to name a few). To trade 
on  their  exchanges,  a  user  has  to  access  them 
from a desktop or laptop.

Some  suggest  visiting  the  exchange’s  website 
from  a  mobile  phone,  but  that  is  a  burdensome 
and unpleasant experience altogether. The fastest 
growing financial market the world has ever seen, 
coupled with the most active and mobile society 
since the dawn of man, should not confine traders 
to the desktop.
For cryptocurrency to truly reach mass adoption 
and  take  a  hold  of  every  corner  of  the  world,  it 
must be accessible from every pocket in the world.

Customer Service

“

The goal as a company is to have customer service that is not just the best, but legendary. ”

Another issue slowing the adoption of widespread 
cryptocurrency  trading  is  the  noticeable  lack  of 
quality customer service. Current exchanges take 
no pride in taking care of their customers. Users 
are left in the dark for weeks (or months) as they 
wait for their “ticket” to be addressed. There are 
hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  flowing  through 
these exchanges each day and customers are left 
to wait for months to receive a simple reply. This 
needs to change. Until society feels comfortable 
with  the  care  they  receive  from  their  chosen 
exchange,  crypto  will  find  it  incredibly  hard  to 
reach its “late majority”.
At Vector, we will provide top of the line customer 
service joining the likes of Apple and Amazon.

Our customers will always come first and traders 
will  feel  comfortable  reaching  out  to  us  with 
questions or concerns.
Vector will set a new standard for customer service. 
To emulate this vision to you in the small capacity I 
can, I Nicholas Marblestone, the Founder of Vector 
and the leading visionary for a new and improved 
cryptocurrency exchange, would like you to have 
my personal mobile number: 
+1 (470) 342-4265
Do  not  hesitate  to  text  me,  or  call  me  for  any 
questions  you  have  about  my  vision  for  Vector 
crypto exchange.
This is what real customer service looks like.

“

Every successful business is a reflection of its community. ”

Right  now,  exchanges  are  distant,  emotionless 
entities  with  no  connection  to  their  users.  Even 
during  the  rare  times  in  which  traders  are  given 
the opportunity to vote on which new coins should 
be listed on the exchange, the outcome is often 
swayed  by  bots  or  subreddits  full  of  shills  who 
simply care about dumping their coin after a 10x 
gain.
Most times, the exchange will simply add a new 
coin,  with  no  rhyme  or  reason  in  doing  so.  We 
believe  that  an  exchange  is  not  only  a  place  to 
trade cryptocurrency, but also a place to build a real 
community.  A  community  which  should  have  the 
power to vote for real changes in the ecosystem, 
and a place where votes will not be manipulatable.

A true community-driven exchange by definition, 
will become the largest and most efficient exchange 
there is. As we use the VCTR coin holder’s voting 
power to decide which new coins will go on the 
exchange,  adding  various  chat-boxes  for  coins, 
which charting systems to use, and more, Vector 
will  grow  into  the  one  and  only  cryptocurrency 
exchange that was truly built by the people who 
use it.

First, let’s sum up how a ‘regular’ cryptocurrency 
exchange  works.  Cryptocurrency  exchanges  are 
simply a medium between traders.
People looking to sell Bitcoins specify the amount 
and the price they’d like to sell them at. All those 
requests,  known  as  ‘orders’,  are  placed  in  a 
common ledger, called the ‘order book.’ There are 
two types of orders: limit orders and market orders. 
Limit orders allow a trader to buy bitcoins at a price 
lower than the current price or sell bitcoins higher 
than the current price.
However,  these  orders  will  only  be  executed 
once another user’s bid or ask order crosses that 
threshold. Market orders will simply find the best 
matching limit order and execute the transaction. 
When  another  person  wants  to  buy  Bitcoin,  they 
either look for a satisfactory offer in the order book 
or,  if  none  can  be  found,  create  their  own  ‘buy 
order’, specifying the terms of the deal as they like. 
Whenever  possible,  the  exchange  matches  buy 
and sell orders by price and processes the trades.

Exchange

Now,  Bitcoin  transactions  can  take  a  long  time 
-  from  five  to  10  minutes  at  the  least,  and  up  to 
several  hours.  Fiat  money  transfers  usually  take 
even longer; in some cases, international payments 
may  take  several  days  to  complete.  In  order  to 
speed  up  the  process  of  trading,  the  exchange 
serves as a trusted intermediary: it settles all trades 
immediately, even though the actual transactions 
might have not yet been finished.
Our exchange will provide all necessary functions 
to exchange alt-coins as desired.

The VCTR coin

The VCTR coin is an ERC-20 token (built on 
Ethereum).
The  voting  rights  obtained  from  holding  VCTR 
coins are one of the distinct factors that separate 
our  exchange  from  others.  At  the  present  time, 
exchanges  are 
far  away  entities,  handling 
transactions,  making  their  own  rules,  and  rarely 
responding to customer complaints. This is where
Vector is different, and it all begins with the VCTR 
coin. With each coin held you will receive a vote.

These  votes  will  give  coin  holders  the  decisions 
in  determining  the  direction  Vector  heads.  The 
decision  of  what  new  coins  will  be  added  to  the 
exchange 
is  democratized,  and  unable  to  be 
manipulated  by  bots  or  company  shills. The  only 
way  to  vote,  is  to  hold  VCTR  coins.  Utilizing  a 
proof-of-stake system, the longer you hold VCTR 
coins, the more votes you accumulate. One of our 
goals is to create a community of VCTR holders, 
continuously accumulating votes and determining 
the direction Vector exchange will go.

The minimum amount of VCTR coins required to vote is one.

These votes are not only reserved for determining 
which new coins are to be added to our exchange, 
they will also be for a variety of other decisions 
such as but not limited to: which charting systems 
to integrate, which crypto news channels we will 
add to our news feed, various system updates, 
chatbox support for each coin, custom profiles for 
traders to connect, etc. The longer you hold your 
VCTR, the more votes you will receive.

To put it simply, we have created a “POS” system, 
the reward being votes.
This chart illustrates the amount of VCTR held, 
and how that correlates with vote multiplication 
over time.

Taking into account the factors below, we have decided to 
open up the Vector token sale to all U.S. participants.
The  definition  of  a  security  under  Section  2(a)(1)  of  the 
Securities  Act  is  defined,  a  security  is  an  investment  of 
money or value in a business or operation where the investor 
has a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts 
of others. We at Vector, inform all possible contributors to this 
project that you will not make profit with our VCTR coin. There 
will be no profit sharing, dividends, or any other return from 
our company. The VCTR coin will be added onto secondary 
exchanges for the sole purpose of allowing users to purchase 
VCTR that were not able to acquire VCTR during the token 
sale. Whether the VCTR coin price rises or falls on secondary 
exchanges is entirely out of our control and will be at the sole 
risk of VCTR coin users.
A  good  methodology  for  determining  if  one’s  token  is  a 
security  is  by  utilizing  the  “Howey Test”. The  US  Supreme 
Court  case  of  SEC  v  Howey  established  the  test  for 
whether  an  arrangement  involves  an  investment  contract. 
An investment contract is a type of security. In the context 

of blockchain tokens, the Howey test can be expressed as 
three independent elements (the third element encompasses 
both the third and fourth prongs of the traditional Howey test). 
All three elements must be met in order for a token to be a 
security.
1.  An investment of money - yes
2. 

in a common enterprise (In the context of an investment 
contract, a “common enterprise” is defined as an enterprise 
in which the fortunes of the investor are interwoven with 
and  dependent  upon  the  efforts  and  success  of  those 
offering or selling the investment or of third parties.) - no
3.  with  an  expectation  of  profits  predominantly  from  the 

efforts of others. - no

As one can deduce from the example above: 3 of the 4 prongs 
in the Howey Test are met with a “no”, meaning VCTR coin is 
not a security.
