The energy industry used to be simple.
Vertically-integrated utilities sat in the middle of the system, like benevolent
spiders spinning a web out to the last consumer requesting connection: they
decided where and when to build generating capacity; they decided how to
bridge the distance between generators and loads; they kept the system in
balance through the deft application of the levers available to a centralized
controlling entity.
While  progressive  utilities  and  regulators  try  to  position  themselves  as
consumer-focused or consumer-centric, the reality is, even the most progressive
are  only  rephrasing  a  narrative  that  pushes  citizens  into  categories  of
consumers.
Clinging to the umbilicus of the power network, consumers are fed a steady diet
of price and product. The cost of energy security can be counted in terms of

Electricity is a critical enabler. The current electrification state of the global
population is at  84%. Advanced and transitional economies require secure
access  to  modern  sources  of  energy,  to  underpin  their  development  and
growing prosperity.
In  developing  countries,  access  to  affordable  and  reliable  energy  is
fundamental to reducing poverty, improving health, increasing productivity,
enhancing competitiveness and promoting economic growth.
Hundreds of millions of people have attained modern energy access over the
last two decades through distribution networks, especially in China and India.
This means that more people on Earth than ever before are now connected to
ever-growing and interconnected electricity networks.
This creates an enormous appetite for innovative new energy peer-to-peer
(P2P) energy transaction platforms.
1.2.2                                                                                   NON-STATIONARY ENERGY
In addition to stationary electricity consumers (buildings, factories, apartments
and houses), non-stationary electricity users are driving up electricity demand
across the globe.
The year 2015 saw the global threshold exceed 1 million Electric Vehicles (EV) on
the road, with the total number closing at 1.26 million.
To service this growing fleet, there were an estimated total of 1.45 million electric
car charging points worldwide in 2015.
EVs are forecast to reach price parity with combustion engine cars by 2025,
largely due to falling battery cost and increasing fuel density. The deployment
scenarios for the stock of EVs range:
o   Between 2 to 20 million EVs in use worldwide by 2020;
o   Between 18 to 60 million by 2025; and
o   Between 22 to 140 million by 2030.

In Australia, in the years between 2011 and 2016, more new generating capacity
was installed on residential roofs than was connected to transmission networks.
If regulator forecasts are accurate, network businesses face the prospect of
leaking  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  in  revenue  as  a  result  of  the  load
defection brought about through the proliferation of rooftop PV and the uptake
of distributed energy storage.
There is an inconvenient truth facing the traditional energy supply industry: at
some stage, it will be cheaper and more effective to self-supply than to rely on
the network to provide low-cost and reliable and clean energy.
It might happen in five years, it might happen in two (according to research for
some consumers it has already happened, see Figure  1.3.1) but we need to
accept the fact that if the only purpose of energy networks is the provision of
energy, then we are putting them up against some stern competition in the
form of DERs.
Figure 1.3.1: 30 of the countries
analyzed in 2015 by Deutsche
Bank had reached grid parity:
where solar generation was equal
or less than local retail electricity
prices.
There  is  an  alternative  to  this  steadily  emerging  obsolescence  and,  oddly
enough, it can help to preserve the value of existing network assets while
reducing the risk of investment for those co-creating the energy system of the
future.
Re-imagining the network as a decentralized and “trustless” trading platform.
The  rapid  penetration  of  DERs  means  we  now  have  a  distribution  system
characterized by bi-directional flows of energy and millions of active prosumers.

proposition  that  could  encourage  even  greater  investment  in  distributed
renewables and a new era of network management.
This new paradigm will see ever increasing levels of automation and resilience
led,  not  by  a  small  number  of  large-scale  centralized  investments,  but  by
millions of micro-investments distributed across the system.

And trustless?
A trading platform that requires third-party settlement and reconciliation of
millions of transactions between hundreds of thousands of traders across 5-
minute  trading  intervals  would  be  almost  impossible  to  support  without  a
central player taking control of all parties’ data, prescribing fees, requiring trust,
proving accuracy and binding the market up in red tape and bureaucracy. But
the  blockchain  is  an  agreement  machine  that  can  facilitate  the  financial
settlement of these transactions, in the same trading intervals in which the
energy is produced and consumed, and it can be achieved at a speed not
possible using current market settlement technologies.
Blockchain-enabled P2P energy trading will transform energy networks into
trading platforms and invoke a transactive economy that moves away from
bilateral retail arrangements to multi-lateral trading ecosystems, preserving
networks’ relevance to consumers.

Blockchain is a software innovation for establishing digital trust between users
facilitating transactions of value, over a network.
The blockchain enables trust to be distributed throughout a network, without
the need for a central intermediary to track, verify and approve the digital
exchange of value. The notion of authorizing trust from a central intermediary
currently  underpins  both  private  and  government  institutional  structures,
however this is proving to be costly, slow, and also vulnerable to attack. The

blockchain overcomes these issues by operating as a decentralized distributed
database, maintaining a continuously growing list of records called blocks.
Although blockchain technology is still an emergent one, current applications
show it can be better, more efficient and more secure than traditional systems,
which is why banks and governments globally are beginning to experiment
with it.
1.5.1                                                                                   SMART CONTRACTS
On-chain computer code or  “Smart Contracts” are computer protocols that
facilitate, verify, or enforce the performance of a contract making a contractual
clause unnecessary. Smart contracts often emulate the logic of contractual
clauses.
Smart contracts can exchange money, property, shares or anything of value in
a transparent, conflict-free way, while avoiding the services of a middleman.
Ordinarily, a process would require payment to a middleman, government
agency, bank, lawyer or a notary, and then a processing time before the receipt
of goods or services. However, with smart contract technology it can all be
automated.
Smart contract technology can be compared to that of an automated vending
machine.  With  a  vending  machine,  money  is  deposited  into  the  vending
machine and the desired item drops for collection, provided that the correct
amount is deposited.
Comparable to that, with a smart contract, the money is deposited into escrow
on the blockchain for receipt of a transfer of a token (e.g. a digital certificate of
title for a house), which is instantaneously transferred into a counterparty’s
control once conditions are met.
Smart contracts not only define the terms and conditions around an agreement
in the same way that a traditional contract does, but also provide enforcement
of those obligations.

It  is  not  just  network  service  providers  that  benefit  from  maintaining  the
relevance of one of our most important social assets.
The people that have the most to lose in the face of falling network utilization
are the people that have the least ability to influence their exposure to rising
network costs and the impact on grid-supplied energy.

The financially and socially marginalized renters, the huge number of tenants
living  in  group  housing  developments  and  even  those  whose  homes  are
oriented  in  the  wrong  direction  or  are  exposed  to  shading  from  nearby
buildings or trees, are the people who will bear the impact of falling network
utilization if we do not find a way to incentivize Prosumers to stick tight to the
network.
Unlike the centrally-managed power systems of the past, the future of the
energy system, will be co-created by the prosumers and investors that will
decide where and when to install DER.
1.7                                                                                     HUMAN ENERGY
Energy trading between citizens brings humanity to the energy system.
Citizen Utilities:
Instead of faceless traders hedging their positions, Citizen Utilities return profits   participants who
generate, consume
to communities, incentivize community investments in generating assets, and             and transact
electricity
allow the sharing or gifting of energy.
Ultimately, as dynamic distributed energy markets become mainstream, the
owners of DERs can earn an income, not just from the energy they sell but from
the network services they provide such as frequency and voltage control, load
shifting, load shaping and load sinking.
EVs will become the back-up power source of choice as the owners of EVs
monetize their spare energy, not through selling kilowatt hours but by selling
resilient access to the lifestyles we take for granted.
In aspiring communities building modern economies through electrification,
citizen-owned microgrids are a leap in technology that by-passes the mistakes
of  the  past  and  supports  the  development  of  low-cost,  low-carbon,  and
democratic  power  systems  in  towns  and  gated  communities  all  over  the
developing world.
In modern cities, Neo-retailers, the new species of innovative energy retailer, will
support P2P trading through effective aggregation of consumer preference
and demand aligned transparently, with prosumer capacity managing risk and
security and providing choice for consumers.
Human energy will change the face of the energy system because instead of
being  focused  solely  on  profits,  it  will  focus  on  the  broader  needs  of
communities, on aspirations for independence and co-creation, and the long-
term sustainability of energy creation and consumption.

The  Power  Ledger  Platform                                                                              (Platform)  is  a  trustless,  transparent  and
interoperable energy trading platform that supports an ever-expanding suite
of energy applications, with an exchangeable frictionless energy trading token,
Sparkz.
The Power Ledger Token (POWRTM) is the fuel of the Power Ledger Ecosystem
with bespoke private trading applications creating Sparkz in exchange for
POWRs.   Sparkz are currently purchased and redeemed using fiat currencies
with individual trading platforms hosting closed-loop exchanges for energy
and Sparkz.
Energy  trading  applications  are  not  just  conceptual,  they  are  proven  and
deployed  in  communities  and  energy  markets  around  the  world  including
Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Asia.
Fiat Currency: is a legal tender that is backed by the sovereign government state that issues it. The
Australian dollar and U.S. dollar is fiat money, as are many other major world currencies. This differs
from money whose value is underpinned by some physical good such as gold or silver (commodity
money).
Cryptocurrency: a digital currency in which mathematical encryption techniques and network consensus
protocols
are used to regulate the generation of units of
currency and verify transactions (i.e. the transfer of funds), operating independently of
a central bank. It can be
used as a form of P2P digital money, purely relying on the blockchain ledger and verification through
encryption algorithms, rather than a centrally controlled entity like a central bank.

LATFORM APPLICATIONS
2.0
The Power Ledger Ecosystem supports a growing number of energy trading
applications. The key classes of Platform  Applications developed by Power
Ledger  are  listed  below,  with  some  already  operational,  and  others  in
advanced conceptual design or in development.
2.1                                                                                   P2P TRADING
This  class  of  Platform  Application  gives  retailers  the  ability  to  empower
consumers (or in an unregulated environment, the consumers themselves) to
simply trade electricity with one another and receive payment in real-time from
an automated and trustless reconciliation and settlement system. There are
many other immediate benefits such as being able to select a clean energy
source, trade with neighbors, receive more money for excess power, benefit
from  transparency  of  all  your  trades  on  a  blockchain,  and  very  low-cost
settlement costs, all leading to lower power bills and improved returns for
investments in distributed renewables.
2.2                                                                                   NEO-RETAILER
Neo-Retailer: an
innovative energy
This class of Platform Application provides Neo-retailers with smart demand           retailer who supports
P2P trading through
and supply management, along with almost instantaneous remuneration and
effective aggregation
of consumer
payment settlements while managing consumer exposure to the risk of non-
preference and
supply.                                                                                                                                                                demand
2.3                                                                                   MICROGRID/EMBEDDED NETWORK OPERATOR/STRATA
This  type  of  Platform  Application  enables  electricity  metering,  big  data
acquisition,   rapid   micro-transactions,   and   grid   management   at   an
unprecedented  granular  scale.  Trading  in  embedded  networks  breaks  the
nexus  between  generation  ownership  and  energy  consumption,  meaning
value can be derived from an investment in DER even if the investor is absent or
doesn’t consume all the energy they generate.
2.4                                                                                   WHOLESALE MARKET SETTLEMENT
                                                                                      This Platform Application class offers rapid low-cost and transparent dispatch
                                                                                      optimization   and   management,   data   aggregation,   reconciliation,   and
                                                                                      settlement for wholesale energy marketplaces.

This current Platform Application allows for (1) shared ownership of renewable
energy assets and (2) trading renewable asset ownership. The AA is able to buy
and sell its own electricity and distribute its income to assigned wallet addresses.
2.6                                                                                    DISTRIBUTED MARKET MANAGEMENT
This Platform Application provides optimized metering data, the collection of
big data, right to access and dispatch of assets, rapid transaction settlement,
network load balancing, frequency management, demand side response, and
demand side and load management. The optimization of network assets is
made viable by the near real-time remuneration of asset owners.
2.7                                                                                    ELECTRIC VEHICLES
This class of Platform Application facilitates real time metering data (interfacing
with  the  Open  Charge  Point  Protocol                                               (OCPP)),  collection  of  data,  user
identification and rapid transaction settlement.
2.8                                                                                    POWER PORT
A class of Platform Application whereby virtual pipeline and roadside assistance
type assets may be automated via the platform, such as EVs, and can provide
a   mobile   storage   discharge   facility   maintaining   energy   supplies   to
predominantly self-sufficient energy consumers.
2.9                                                                                    CARBON TRADING
This Platform Application class offers smart contracts for carbon traders to
assure  digital  transactions  across  organizations:  credibility  of  asset  using
immutable distributed ledger technology; and transparency and auditability. It
supports  reporting  and  surrendering  of  carbon  credits  or  certificates  to
regulatory authorities.
2.10        TRANSMISSION EXCHANGE
In the management of transmission networks, the Platform can provide real
time metering data, collection of big data, right to access and dispatch assets,
rapid transaction settlement, and network load balancing, responding to non-
stationary energy.

4.0                                                                                  TECHNICAL OVERVIEW
4.1                                                                                  INTRODUCTION
The  Power  Ledger  Platform  is  the  Ecosystem  that  enables  interoperability
between  diverse  market  management/pricing  mechanisms  and  units  of
electricity (kWh) by way of pre-purchased tokens.
The Power Ledger Platform provides a transparent governance framework that
allows the Ecosystem to seamlessly interface with energy markets around the
globe, bringing innovation and a wide range of network benefits to consumers.
This approach means the Ecosystem is adaptable and scalable for applications
within any existing or future regulatory environment, achieving the dynamic
agility required to adapt to any number of regulatory structures.   This dynamic
agility,  allows  a  redefinition  of  where  Application  Hosts                     (utilities,  retailers,
property managers, etc.) and customers (users) are positioned in the Ecosystem
and who has market power in any transactive arrangement.
The market flexibility of the Ecosystem is facilitated by deployment of a dual
token Ecosystem (POWR and Sparkz) operating throughout its two blockchain
layers.
POWR tokens are the frictionless blockchain tokens that allow Application Hosts
and Participants access to and use of the Platform  (like a limited software
licensing permission).
Sparkz tokens are issued against escrowed POWR tokens, via a Smart Bond,
and used by the Application Host to onboard its customers.
Application Hosts are entities and businesses that run an Application on the
Platform.  For  example,  a  utility  company  using  the  Platform  will  be  an
Application  Host,  as  is  an  EV-charging  services  business.  A  Decentralized
Autonomous Organization can also become an Application Host.
“Off the shelf” applications may be used in the Ecosystem. Applications such
as FuseBox, Power Ledger’s P2P Energy Trading Application which acts as a
“Utility in a box”, allowing Utilities to manage and on-board participants to the
Platform and to reap the technology benefits and cost advantages it offers.
Power Ledger Pty Ltd Copyright © 2018                                                16




Applications  may  also  be  developed  by  third  parties,  using  the  Platform’s
designs and services to fast track innovative consumer applications. The POWR
to Sparkz ratio for third party developers may be adjusted depending on their
customer feedback and reputation.
Sparkz,  the                                                                          “low  level”  token,  are  specifically  limited  to  representing  the
tokenized value of a unit of electricity in varying markets around the world.
Sparkz and POWR tokens will be exchangeable, connecting the functions of the
Ecosystem. Sparkz maintain a steady exchange rate between local market
electricity prices and the exchange priced POWR token.
Figure 4.1.1 shows the design architecture where Application Hosts (i.e. an energy
utility company) will buy POWR tokens from the open market.
Figure 4.1.1: The                                                                     Figure 4.1.2: The direct
retail model for                                                                      peer-to-peer model for
working with existing                                                                 working within
market structures                                                                     deregulated market
structures
Consumer and Prosumers buy and sell energy, which is settled with Sparkz
tokens and may redeem the Sparkz for cash via their Application Host.
The level of disruption from the Ecosystem is able to be controlled by
Application Hosts ensuring rapid and early adoption of the technology whilst
supporting Utilities’ needs to migrate at a speed that works for their
Power Ledger Pty Ltd Copyright © 2018                                                 17




organization.  This controlled deployment of the disruptive benefits will also help
Application Hosts to transfer technology to consumers, helping them to grow
their consumer base using their local market knowledge.
Figure 4.1.2 advances the concept such that POWR tokens can be used directly
in   P2P   trading   between   Prosumers   and   Consumers,   with   near   zero
intermediation - and this is the way markets will operate as deregulation in the
sector moves forward in the years to come.
4.2                                                                                   POWR TOKEN
The POWR token will serve as the fuel of the Power Ledger Ecosystem.
POWR tokens help to facilitate low cost and better returns on electricity. They
interact with the Ecosystem through:
   Providing governance and consumer protection through Smart Bond
technology (section 4.4)
   Facilitating access to use the Platform (section 4.4)
   Providing loyalty rewards to Participants (see section 4.6);
   Contributing  and  connecting  with  renewable  energy  charities  and
organizations (see section 4.6);
   Providing access priority to Asset Germination Events and benefits from
an asset’s ‘POWR’ generation (see section 5.5.7); and
4.3                                                                                   DUAL TOKEN ECOSYSTEM
To  synchronize  the  Ecosystem  globally  and  create  cross-market  electricity
compatibility, a second token, Sparkz, is used for Ecosystem transactions.
Sparkz tokens are priced, issued, and redeemed in the local currency of the
Platform Participant.
Purchasing a sufficient amount of POWR tokens allows Application Hosts access
to the Ecosystem from where they can convert their POWR tokens to Sparkz and
on-board their customer base.
POWR tokens are required to generate Sparkz. Sparkz are a local market level
token and are priced for the exchange market they are deployed in, e.g. In
Australia 1 Sparkz = 1 cent AUD. They allow for frictionless transacting throughout
the FuseBox applications.

4.4                                                                                   POWR TOKENS ARE ACCESS PERMISSION TOKENS
POWR tokens allow the Application Hosts and their consumers to gain access
to the P2P trading features and other Power Ledger applications.
As an example, an Application Host would need to purchase enough POWR
tokens  to  generate  the  necessary  Sparkz  for  their  consumers  to  transact
electricity in their home market. The Application Host will need to maintain a
sufficient number of POWR tokens to generate the necessary Sparkz required,
for their consumer base.
In a deregulated market, where Participants are able to trade directly with each
other without the need for intermediaries, Participants will be able convert their
POWR  tokens  directly  to  Sparkz  and  transact  on  the  platform  without  an
Application Host.
To use services on the Platform each Application Host will require POWR tokens
to transact for Sparkz, in their local jurisdiction. POWR tokens can be seen as the
global token that opens access to the Platform for all Participants, to on-board
the system. The POWR token is the access token, like a software license, that
grants ability for Application Hosts to transact on the Platform, through trading
POWR tokens for Sparkz.
Once an Application Host has exhausted all POWR tokens they can no longer
transact on the Platform until they obtain more POWR to provide Platform
access.

For incumbent market participants, the POWR token will provide not only access
to the network, but also the Smart Bond functionalities.                              Smart Bonds:   an

parties.
Application Hosts such as Energy Retailers and Network Utilities will be required
to provide the POWR tokens as surety for the Sparkz they receive from the
Platform.  The  Sparkz  are  then  used  to  transact  electricity  between  their
Customers in their home market.

POWR tokens will be escrowed for Sparkz in an Ethereum Smart Bond, and can
only be unlocked from the Smart Bond upon the return of the Sparkz.
It is expected Application Hosts will need to acquire more POWR tokens over
time to facilitate an increase in transactions as their consumer base grows and
the technology becomes more widely adopted. The more POWR tokens that
are escrowed for Sparkz, the more organic demand is created for the POWR
tokens.
The Smart Bond contract will ensure consumer protection in the event of the
failure of an Application Host  (i.e. bankruptcy). P2P Consumers are able to
redeem their Sparkz directly, against the POWR tokens previously provided as
surety and port to another Application Host.

All Prosumers generating and Consumers purchasing renewable energy are
rewarded POWR tokens, under the Green Energy Loyalty Rewards program, for
using  the  Platform.  The  incentive  formula  is  weighted  towards  renewable
energy producers. The Loyalty Incentive Program is funded by charging a small
fee for all P2P transactions on the Platform. Part of the fee is then used to
purchase POWR tokens on exchanges and distribute them under the program,
incentivizing renewable energy generation.
The  goal  of  the  POWR  tokens  is  to  ensure  that  incentives  for  Developers,
Application Hosts, and Participants are all aligned and, as they contribute to the
democratization of energy, they are rewarded for the evolution and future
success of the Power Ledger Ecosystem. As the Ecosystem user-base grows, the
demand for POWR™ tokens will likely increase.
For the Platform to be truly global and decentralized, the POWR tokens may in
the future facilitate Green Energy Generation Initiatives, driving sustainability.
Customers could donate micro-portions of their transactions to charities and/or
organizations that contribute towards innovative renewable and sustainable
energy projects
Through P2P trading of clean energy and the supporting of Green Energy
Generation  Initiatives,  more  users  are  incentivized  to  adopt  the  Platform
creating a virtuous cycle for sustainable energy.
4.7                                                                                    POWR AND EXCHANGES
Power Ledger Pty Ltd Copyright © 2018  20




The standardized Ethereum ERC20 POWR tokens may also be used on public
exchanges. Exchanges are independent and not operated by Power Ledger.
However, Exchanges serve to further decentralize and add transparency to
POWR tokens, by giving the holders of POWR the choice to exit or enter the
token Platform.
POWR  tokens  provide  efficiency  in  the  ease  of  transfer  for  clean  energy.
Participants with POWR tokens will be able to instantly transact through an
Application  Host once  the  Platform  is live  in  their region  and  the  requisite
regulatory  framework  emerges.  As  markets  become  fully  deregulated  the
Participants will be able to transact directly through the platform without the
requirement for Application Hosts.
Prosumers and  Consumers of the  Power Ledger Ecosystem  will be  able  to
transfer and receive clean green energy credits anywhere in the world as the
Platform is gradually rolled out globally. If a Prosumer or Consumer moves to
another country, it is not necessary for them to close their account and exit the
system. The Power Ledger Ecosystem will be a global Platform that allows users
to migrate between applications and instantly transact with their POWR tokens.
The  transparent  governance  framework  at  the  Ecosystems  center  will  be
inclusive by design, enabling an easy interface by Application Hosts. This will
drive  early  adoption  and  allows  seamless  interfacing  with  energy  markets
around the world, bringing innovation and a wide range of network benefits to
Consumers.
At its core, the focus is providing lower cost energy and better returns on energy
for  citizen  investors,  whilst  providing  powerful  incentives  to  prioritize  the
adoption of renewable clean energy.

The Public Layer utilizes the Ethereum blockchain and is where the Ecosystem
interfaces with third party token exchanges.
The Public Layer and third-party exchanges operate independently and are
outside of Power Ledger Ecosystem’s control and provide the most advanced
security and decentralization available to the ERC20 standard POWR tokens.
Users may choose to exchange their POWR tokens publicly or store them and
later  utilize  them  within  Power  Ledger’s  FuseBox  P2P  application  software,
if/when they become available within the user’s local energy marketplace.
The Public Layer provides a mechanism for interfacing and transacting with the

Power Ledger successfully developed EcoChain, in September  2016, its own
private Proof-of-Stake blockchain for use in the power industry. It was deployed
in Western Australia, and internationally in New Zealand, and is currently in use
in a number of other existing trials.

State Channels provide a way to execute blockchain transactions in an off-
chain manner by locking the blockchain state utilizing multi-signatures or smart
contracts.  In  order  to  update  the  state,  a  specific  set  of  Participants  must
completely agree with each other. Eventually the state is closed and sent to the
blockchain.
Due to the high frequency nature of energy transaction settlement, the Platform
will increasingly utilize state channels to handle these events.

The Ecosystem’s Application Layer is the FuseBox. It’s where the magic happens!
The  Ecosystem’s  architecture  facilitates  easy  adaptation  for  both  highly
regulated and deregulated energy markets.
The Ecosystem’s most advanced Application was developed by Power Ledger
and is a versatile P2P Trading Application.   It allows for direct trading between
Prosumers   and   Consumers   with   or   without   the   inclusion   of   industry
intermediaries  such  as  market  operators,  retailers  or  transmission  network
operators.  Application  Hosts  are  already  trialing  this  Application  for  their
consumers.
Figure 5.5.1:
Example of a
FuseBox
application:
The  Application  was  designed  to  be  configured  to  suit  prevailing  market
structures  and  existing  regulations  with  the  ability  to  reconfigure  itself  and
continue trading seamlessly as policy change occurs within the local operating
environment.
Currently, all transacting of energy is performed via the Sparkz tokens, which
are  pegged  to  the  local  unit  of  currency.  This  allows  for  any  number  of
Power Ledger Pty Ltd Copyright © 2018  25




economic and time-based pricing scenarios, to be applied across all countries
and electricity pricing structures.
User migration is possible via the standard POWR token, which has its Sparkz
conversion rates anchored to the currency of the financial market where it was
originally deployed.
5.5.1                                                                                   METER READINGS
Meter reading details are recorded in intervals of 1 to 30 minutes depending on
the Application Host’s requirements and can be displayed to the Participant, in
near  real-time  or                                                                     24  hour  delayed  depending  on  the  hardware  and
communication network available. Trial readings in 2016 and early 2017 were
generally  taken  every  15-30  minutes,  for  design  and  stress  testing  of  the
Platform and to provide the most realistic actual trade matching time interval.
5.5.2                                                                                   TRADE ENGINE
Power Ledger has developed its own unique trade matching algorithms which
transact  available  power  equitably,  between  Prosumers  and  Consumers,
without favoring any of the Participants.
Consumer orders on both sides of the market are filled in equal increments and
cycled continuously, until the market has cleared. This allows new consumers to
on-ramp and immediately receive equal allocation of the available pool of
renewable  energy  in  their  area,  whilst  minimizing  the  distance  between
consumers. This has an impact on transmission efficiencies and thus minimizing
carbon emissions.
Trading  run  cycles  are  configurable  and  can  be  selected,  based  on  the
Application Host’s requirements. They currently range from  5 minutes to  24
hours.
5.5.3                                                                                   TRADING GROUP BUILDER
Power  Ledger’s  trading  group  priority  allows  for  maximum  flexibility  in  the
trading configuration of the various Application Hosts. Individual meters can be
grouped and their electricity transacted within market and proximity based
priority groups (See example in Figure 5.5.3.1).
Platform Participants trade within a specified trading group configured by their
Application Host  (regulated) or by Power Ledger  (unregulated). Participants
with remaining import/export kWh to trade move up the trade priority groups
until all remaining kWh are sold.
Power Ledger Pty Ltd Copyright © 2018  26




A Retailer or Neo-Retailer may ultimately fill any remaining orders acting as the
“risk manager” or the buyer and seller of last resort.
Trading  groups  can  also  be  determined  autonomously  by  pre-configured
network condition monitoring. This provides the underpinning framework for
dynamic distribution markets, within smart-networks.
Figure 5.5.3.1:
Example of
Trading Priority
Groups
5.5.4     BLOCKCHAIN
Currently readings are recorded directly into the EcoChain Blockchain Services
Interface as they are collected from smart power meters, via a suite of Power
Ledger APIs. All energy trading is similarly immediately settled via the interface
as they occur and provides for a secure and trustworthy audit trail, for all
Participants.  The  existing  EcoChain  was  designed  to  run  multiple  private
blockchains (allocated to cover geographical areas) with tangling into a public
blockchain, that also minimize data mining for maximum scalability.
5.5.5     GEO-LOCATION PRIORITY (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)
As Prosumers generate and export electricity to the grid, the electricity naturally
flows  to  its  closest  consumption  point.  Power  Ledger’s  Trade  Engine  2.0  is
currently being designed to geo-locate Participants and prioritizes proximity to
assist  in  network  load  balancing  and  provide  economic  incentive  for  the

deployment of distributed generation sources, at efficient intervals across the
distribution network.
Power  Ledger’s  blockchain  P2P  trade  and  settlement  engine  provides  the
backbone for other FuseBox applications.
5.5.6                                                                                 CONSUMER CHOICES
Power  Ledger’s  Ecosystem  puts  choice  in  the  hands  of  the  Consumer  by
allowing them to specify where they want to purchase their energy from.
For example, an energy consumer may choose to pay a premium to ensure
their energy comes from locally produced solar energy at buildings built with
eco-materials, this incentivizes eco-driven choices.
5.5.7                                                                                 AUTONOMOUS ASSETS AND ASSET GERMINATION EVENTS
Power Ledger’s current Autonomous Asset (AA) management module allows
for shared ownership and trading of renewable assets. The AA is able to buy
and sell its own electricity and distribute its income to assigned wallet addresses
(See example in Figure 5.5.7.1)
This allows communities to collectively invest in renewable energy infrastructure
increasing the rate we move towards a zero emissions future.
