The Blockchain for Private Equity
The first globally live security token platform,
coming to market by tokenizing funds
and other assets

Abstract
Swarm’s governance-first model has been designed to bring  $1
trillion  in  real  assets  into  the  blockchain  world  by  creating  a
platform for regulatory engagement and a fully compliant legal
container for highly profitable and scalable investments.
As  with  other  highly  successful  network  models  like  Visa,  our
infrastructure  is  fully  accessible  and  entirely  governed  by  its
community  members.  We  use  a  token-based,  stake-weighted,
liquid democracy system to provide both an early adopter incentive
and input into long-term decision making. This is augmented by a
reputational system, which helps streamline capital deployment
and allow a fusion of human and artificial intelligence.
We launch with multiple partner funds (distressed real estate, art,
renewables, hedge funds) who have already deployed  $100mm+
with  30+%  IRR  and  team  members  who  have  built  platforms
that  handle  over  $20B  in  transactions  per  month.  Our  market
infrastructure  allows  funds  to  automate  creation,  fundraising,
deployment,  distribution,  and  reporting  via  a  process  language
that  is  an  enhancement  of  currently  available  smart  contract
technology.

This system is designed to be adaptable
for full regulatory compliance in multiple
jurisdictions. The corridor between the public

designed to be fully AML/KYC compliant and to
follow the model of existing exchanges.

Core Objective: Collective Intelligence
We believe in the swarm intelligence hypothesis that decentralized networks
can out-compete traditional centralized entities, and that the trust and
transparency embedded in blockchains greatly facilitates this.
The foundational element of the blockchain is data transparency, which
provides a basis for an unprecedented degree of machine-driven methods to
generate insights and take actions.
Ultimately, with Swarm we envision a degree of investment automation that
helps participants make informed and data-driven investment decisions,
while using reputational scores to maintain the health of the market. Our
automation can go even further, to where every step of the investment
process, from workflows to establishment of legal structures, will eventually
be automated, creating an efficient system without single points of failure or
control.
With Swarm we envision an unseen
degree of investment automation.

3. Swarm Token
The token distributed during the token launch is known as the Swarm
Token, or SWM. The SWM token is a standard ERC20 token (on the
Ethereum platform) that allows one to use the Swarm software platform.
The utility unlocked by the SWM token is the ability to create sub-
funds, participate in token offerings of Swarm projects, get access
to information that is exclusive to our network, and execute network
governance functions. Member participation is key to the Swarm
platform. Over time, more functionality will be released that helps
generate swarm intelligence for the benefit of the network. This follows
the model pioneered by Visa, SWIFT, and other consortia where common
infrastructure is maintained by member organizations.

3 .2 TOKEN UTILITY AND VALUE
In general, incentives and counter-incentives - elements of Game
Theory - are not new in blockchain projects, and act as core functions
that encourage desired behaviour in a decentralized system.
Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) incentivizes miners to process
transactions on the network, thereby securing it in return for
a monetary reward to the first miner that solves an arbitrary
mathematical problem and creates a new block.
The 2nd generation model with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a more efficient
protocol for validating transactions. New block creators are chosen
deterministically, there is no block reward, and instead, the chosen
block creator is rewarded proportionally to their wealth, or stake in the
network. In other words, with PoS, incentives are constructed to buy
and hold some of the coins being minted, with miners incentivized by
transaction fees.

SWM as Voice
Perhaps the most revolutionary feature of the Swarm platform - and
the one we are very passionate about - is its Liquid Democracy voting
module. Swarm is built with governance designed into the core, and
at every level. Blockchain is maturing beyond payment systems,
stores of value, and distributed applications (Dapps). We are entering
the age of real assets on the blockchain. Art installations, marijuana
plantations, and community-funded infrastructure are all going to be
conceptualized, debated, crowd-funded, realized, and managed on the
blockchain. None of these functions can be performed without a layer
of governance, arguably the most fundamental and important utility of
SWM.
Direct governance of investments is necessary and important, as we
are not building Swarm to be another middleman. The ultimate goal is

4 .2 PLATFORM COMPONENTS
Liquid Democracy Voting Module
Governance is core to Swarm’s mission. And core to that mission is
to create infrastructure that allows participants to vote on issues in a
trustless, transparent, and auditable way, which can persist outside of
Swarm as an organization.
Therefore Swarm is creating a “Liquid Democracy Voting Module”
(“LDVM”), which has been the basis of all voting that the Swarm
organization has performed internally and externally, and first versions
are already available.
The LDVM is intended to be configurable by any developer, integrated
with other platforms, and executed outside of the Swarm platform.
The LDVM will be able to be customized to specific voting populations,
issue discoveries, and consensus methods, as well as voting
processes.
Further, a major objective of new voting systems is to relieve
participants of ongoing voting obligations or complexities around
voting. With the LDVM, users are able to delegate their votes to others
in a persistent fashion, and differentiated by issue category and
duration. With these abilities, the governance of the foundation, as well
as each of the underlying SRC20 tokens and related legal entities, can
be performed in completely new ways; for example, there is no longer
a necessity for board structures.
The LDVM is intended to become a universally applicable voting engine
for any part of the Swarm platform, and to be usable beyond Swarm
in other related or even unrelated projects. In particular, the open
architecture of this module will lead to exciting new applications and
use cases well beyond Swarm.
Purpose-Driven Funding Wallets (“Blackbird”)
One of the use cases powered by the LDVM will be the Blackbird
wallet. A Blackbird wallet is a smart, multi-user wallet that collects
funds and deploys them to a target address that is approved using a
stake-weighted majority. Each Blackbird Wallet can potentially have
connections to realize its purpose on the Swarm network, but not
necessarily.
Blackbird will allow the pooling of capital, such as for a purpose that
has yet to be specified, and all participants together make decisions
along the way about the deployment of capital. As the purpose gets
further specified, more participants gain confidence and invest more
capital, and so on. While a setup like this can have many different
22




use cases, the first iteration of the wallet will be used (1) as a one-
time fund collection and deployment instrument and (2) an evergreen
(ongoing) fund collection and deployment instrument.
There are a number of powerful use cases that can be powered by
Blackbird wallets. Think of Uber drivers pooling their capital to buy a
corner position in Uber. Or the creation of a foundation to offset the
carbon footprint of the blockchain.
Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure for the AI-driven Investment
Economy
The name ”Swarm” is a reference to “Swarm Intelligence,” a form of
decentralized intelligence. In the natural world, it manifests in self-
organizing communities like ant colonies, flocking birds, and schooling
fish. Swarm intelligence is also employed at the vanguard of artificial
intelligence technology. Swarm (the company) is taking a practical,
multi-phasic approach to solving real-world problems, while building
the infrastructure and ecosystem that will allow for decentralized
intelligence to occur.
The first phase of AI at Swarm is a simple approach: providing
users and industry professionals with tools to make more informed
investment decisions via products of machine learning. Within the
Swarm ecosystem, we are rolling out a practical reinforcement
learning algorithm that uses a multi-armed bandit approach (i.e.,
an algorithm that acquires knowledge by performing multiple
experiments simultaneously, assessing results, and quickly learning
to optimize outcomes). This will be combined with some traditional
financial analytics models (EMA, MACD, Ichimoku Cloud), along with
more sophisticated ML models (LSTM, Phased-LSTM and others).
We anticipate this taking a few months to roll out, as the algorithms
require sufficient data and voting within the ecosystem in order to
provide a robust model. A deep roster of funds are in the pipeline to
get listed on the Swarm platform, and our astute AI will analyze them
all. Not only will we deploy our bots for the direct benefit of Swarm
platform participants; we will also offer these tools and infrastructure
to Swarm syndicates to create crypto hedge funds that trade using
machine learning algorithms (ML) in addition to traditional trading
strategies.
The second phase will advance the platform in a few very important
ways: First, it will allow for active trading based on individual
configuration and preferences within the Swarm platform. Some may
individually use the tools, and others may create funds and offer them
as syndicates on top of the platform. Swarm members will be able
to participate in those strategies via the Swarm platform. There are a
23




few key advancements in this phase: The goal will be to employ a large
ensemble of models whose number will be determined by market
factors. Using many reinforcement learning agents, or ”bots,” we can
program them to compete with each other, honing their “intelligence,”
and maximizing potential rewards. A master algo will choose how to
execute trades based on observed potential rewards and observed
market behavior. The goal is to decentralize the AI, eventually achieving
proper Swarm Intelligence (Today we are getting closer, but still not
entirely decentralized from a model perspective.). A key component of
this phase is the ability of models to give information to other models.
This mutual informing can be both adversarial and constructive in
nature. Models that can win the vote of the trade get more reward.
By doing so, models learn to capture and maximize reward across
many different market conditions while tailored to different trading
preferences by investors.
The third phase is a big and extremely exciting one. In Phase 3, we
will fully decentralize the ability to trade within the Swarm network,
and link with other technologies. While Phase 2 allowed the Swarm
professionals to build out fund organizations upon which Swarm
members can vote and invest, Phase 3 will allow any individual quant
and model builder to tokenize their own models and strategies, and
to effectively create their own funds. These models can be trading
algorithms, or models that serve other monetary purposes. For
example, a model builder can provide a language model with the
ability to parse and make sense of Twitter or Telegram feeds. Then,
other models can tap that model for information. The goal is to create
the core market infrastructure and a network of incentives to allow
for both model competition and genetic evolution of performance
and fitness, thus allowing for model primitives to evolve, which
then generalize to different domains. We will release more technical
information on this in the near future.

5. Swarm Applications
Swarm-Supported Asset Types
With the Swarm investment platform serving as a technology reference
framework as well as a global liquidity hub, decentralized application
developers will be able to create new classes of investment assets that
can be used in any number of simple or complex applications.
The following section lays out defining characteristics of asset classes in
which to pilot the Swarm Platform, followed by subsequent sections that
highlight a number of use cases that Swarm has identified as interesting
target markets and which are readily deployable using the Swarm
Platform.

5 .5 PURPOSE-DRIVEN FUNDING POOLS
Swarm is also aiming to help generate impact investments for
nonprofits and social enterprises that help meet significant
community needs and address humanity’s grand challenges. We are
working to ensure basic needs are met for all people, while sustaining
and improving quality of life and mitigating future risks. We hope
to involve individuals and institutions who are using their resources
for social good, and are looking beyond simply making traditional
philanthropic gifts. We seek to help them leverage their capital directly,
with a purpose they deeply care about, and perhaps even earn a small
gain over time.
We believe the crypto community has successfully proven that it can
build incentives for the community itself to create desired outcomes.
We envision purpose-driven funding pools, that incentivize the
entrepreneurial community to create solutions to meet the challenges
and compete for the “bounty” by delivering a “social Proof-of-Stake”,
similar to the way the X-Prizes have fueled innovation.

6. Token Offering
6 .1 TOKEN OFFERING IN BRIEF
The Swarm organization created 100M tokens, and budgeted 33M
tokens to be sold to purchasers. Of these, 8.2M were sold in Q4 2017.
In the current token offering, we are projecting to sell 20M tokens,
targeting a raise of $23.75M USD denominated in ETH. Should the
demand be higher, the Swarm Foundation can decide to re-allocate
token budgets to expand the sale.
With the above, the cap share distribution changes in favor of the
community. As such, a higher market demand within the sale simply
allows for more exchange listings on the SUN network and augments
the value of the platform.
Our method of drip liquidity ensures that earlier token holders cannot
immediately “dump” all of their tokens after the purchase. After the
token generation, the members voted to introduce a liquidity option
that releases the token liquidity in 4 equal releases every 84 days. The
first liquidity release started on Nov 6, 2017, and full liquidity will be
reached on Jul 16, 2018.
6 .2 TOKEN ALLOCATION
Of the total 100M tokens created, 33M tokens will go to contributors
(past Swarm members, advisors, a pool for future contributors), while
33M tokens are assigned to the core team.

7.3 DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP
Current State
Swarm has been under development for
over 18 months. Since then there have been
multiple iterations of the core elements of
Swarm. These include the smart contracts
powering the framework as well as the general
web interface.
The Swarm platform has a fully operational
live implementation since January 2018.
The current operational platform supports
key use cases, such as voting within network
democracy (including delegation), wallet
transfers (ETH/BTC/SWM), and allocation of

Future Development
Phase 1 (Quarter 2 2018):
◆ Legal automation: Underlying the Swarm
platform, our goal is to automate most
of the administrative processes related
to foundation of SPVs (special purpose
vehicles) and fund deployment. We seek to
work with e-governance providers to make
this as seamless and scalable as possible.
◆ SRC20 token standard protocol, with
integration to exchanges supporting security
tokens.

9. Legal Innovations
Swarm co-organized legal summits at Harvard and Stanford in which
the Distributed Collaborative Organisation model was established5.
Legal experts suggested that the integration of a collaborative
governance layer to a distributed organization would make it a
membership organization similar to a co-op. We have remained active
participants in the evolving platform co-op movement and Internet of
Ownership (https://ioo.coop/) movements, including a section in the
book “Ours to Hack and to Own.” (https://platform.coop/book).
Swarm has consistently and openly stated its intent to democratize
finance and proactively engaged with regulators including the SEC,
FCA, and regulators in several other countries. As a result of advice
from top legal experts and regulators, Swarm has operated for the
last two years under the unincorporated non-profit association terms
as described in the results of the Harvard summit with the intent of
creating a global platform cooperative.
To actualize these aims, Swarm has established the following legal
entities:
Swarm Foundation (Liechtenstein)
Swarm Operations GmbH (Germany)
Swarm Operations LLC (USA)
Swarm IP (Singapore)
The contribution period is a collaboration between the above entities
with the intent of taking the “Distributed Collaborative Organization”
model and a creating a legal entity owned and governed by the token
holders. Rather than depend on a single legal firm to implement this,
we will create a bounty system to award the first several teams that
manage to create token-governance systems that integrate into the
legal and tax systems of respective nation states.
38




The current board members are Philipp Pieper and Timo Lehes,
with three spots left to be filled by either community contributors
or managing directors of partner funds, dependent on a vote by the
token holders.
Additionally, all of the currency-related aspects of our implementation,
including actions of all sub-funds, are performed on a private
blockchain implementation. This allows us to implement all standard
AML/KYC procedures and reporting as established by industry best
practice.
Due to the retrospective nature of regulatory action, the Swarm team
can make no guarantees regarding the legality of the platform or
launch in any given jurisdiction. Regardless, we are confident in, and
proud of, the work we have done to shape Swarm into what we hope
is a model of regulatory compliance for decentralized applications
and token launches. We will be responsive and collaborative with any
regulators as necessary going forward.
