1.1 The CENTRE Vision
We live in a world
The open internet -- a global, distributed network
of open, connected,
of computers that share common open software
protocols -- has enabled billions of humans to connect
global, free
and share information instantly, securely and with
communication and                                          zero consumer cost. The implications for the world
have been profound, and are still unfolding.
information sharing.
The invention of cryptographic assets and blockchain-
based computing and data sharing have ushered
in the next major era of the open internet.
Just as HTTPS, SMTP and SIP allowed for free
information sharing and communications, crypto
assets and blockchain technology will allow humans to
exchange value and transact with one another in the
same way: instantly, globally, securely and at low cost.
An open internet of value exchange can transform
and integrate the world more deeply, eventually
eliminating artificial economic borders and enabling
a more efficient and inclusive global marketplace
that connects every person on the planet. The future
of the global economy is open, shared, inclusive, far
more evenly distributed, and powerful not only for a
few chosen gatekeepers, but for all who will connect.
CENTRE was born out of a desire to realize this vision.
