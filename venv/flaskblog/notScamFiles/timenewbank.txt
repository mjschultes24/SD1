Whitepaper
M.I.T - Miao'A International Timechain
1




ABSTRACT
Miao'A International Timechain (M.I.T) is dedicated to building a precision time-value-
based transmission network. We highly acknowledge the time-value of money for each
individual, and that the extent of which an individual's time is valued depends on how
much he/she is needed by others, i.e. the more helpful an individual is, the higher the
individual is needed. For the purpose of better presenting individuals’ time-value, and
effectively matching the time exporters and time demanders, M.I.T will introduce TNB
(Time  New Bank) digital  currency, based on a blockchain  technology  underlying
platform, aiming to establish a time-value transmission network which comprises
prominences  of  decentralization,  internationalization,  payment  flexibility,  pricing
transparency, and strong protection of rights and proof-of-stake.
Our team equips with solid ability of offline resource integration. By far, the team has
initiated collaboration with Miao'A, a well-known online celebrity time-value exchange
service platform, leveraging the Miao’A’s celebrity effects to rapidly and effectively
attract fans and audience, also known as time demanders, in order to construct a
massive buy-side market for the transaction of time commodities and TNB.

PART 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
1.  Background
Time, with its commercial value, can be traded as commodities. It is a concept already
been accepted in human society. From Lunch with Warren Buffet, to the hourly wages
charged by attorneys, we have witnessed various examples of how time-value of
individuals can be materialized. Business models are evolved along dimensions in
space and time that human beings occupy. By exploring the nature of time-related
products, we could see that the value of time commodities is mostly generated from
the value radiation effects of the time exporters, i.e. their capacity to serve, or in others
words, their monetization ability.
2.  Market Painpoints
There is still a long journey for time commodities to become a mature merchandising
segment. The current pain-points on the market can be elaborated as below:
                                                                                               The lack of objective and well-accepted valuation standards for the value of time
commodities;
                                                                                               The lack of transformation tools and sales means for individual’s time to become
commercialized;
                                                                                               Even though time exporters are able to form the primary exchange market solely
on their own or via brokerages, they are short of sufficient resources to construct
the secondary and third markets for effectively exploiting the commercial value of
time commodities;
                                                                                               The lack of a centralized time product trading platform creates complexity for time
demanders to acquire product information and make purchase decisions. As a
result, time demanders are required to master enormous professional knowledge
of laws and business rules, which undoubtedly heightens threshold to enter the
market and generates high risk.
                                                                                               The lack of  effective monitoring  to  verify the authenticity of  time  commodity
transactions could give rise to time exports’ foul plays, such as exaggeration of
transaction volumes in order to self-promote the time value and etc.
                                                                                               The confirmation of ownership is difficult in the current time commodity exchange
process, resulting in high risk of default.

    The current market is limited to local transactions as cross-border transactions are
difficult to achieve and the settlement process are complex and redundant.
3.  Solution - M.I.T Precision Time-Value Transmission Platform
After conducting solid market research and analysis, combining the team’s strong
offline resource integration ability and sales capacity, the team has constructed M.I.T,
a  precision time-value  transmission  platform based on blockchain  technology,  to
organize a comprehensive network comprised of primary, secondary and third market
for time commodity exchange. M.I.T aims to deliver a standardized system that fully
expresses the value of time commodities based on how time exporters are recognized
and  demanded  via  scientific  and  systematic  analytical  model  by  leveraging  its
decentralized value transmission platform. In commodity value transmission process,
TNB will be adopted as the settlement currency to accurately tell both the current and
future value of the time commodities.
Under the abovementioned structure, time demanders can quickly retrieve on the M.I.T
platform to position and purchase the exact time commodity from the exact time
exporter. After completing the purchase, time demanders could either materialize the
time commodities or transfer them on the secondary market. Investors can invest on
commodities via the third market. In this way, multiple-layers of demand are fulfilled.
PART 2. M.I.T PLATFORM & TNB
1.  Introduction of M.I.T Platform
M.I.T refers to the decentralized time commodity value transmission platform based on
Grid, the most avant-garde underlying blockchain technology. The platform serves
designated parties include:
1.1 Time exporters - refer to the providers of time commodities, i.e. the party who
will ultimately fulfill the commitment to spend their time during a specific period of
time to provide service for time commodities buyers. Celebrities, entrepreneurs,
lawyers, physicians, teachers and industry experts can fit into this category. Based
4




on the how much they are demanded, different time allocations, previous credit
ratings, quality of commitment fulfillment and so on, the platform will score the time
exports and the time commodities they provide time of goods output and make
categorization. The rating system will promote benign value of the platform to
ensure healthy and ecological development.
1.2  Time  demanders  -  refer  to  the  demanders  and  buyers  of  the  time
commodities. From the motivation of time consumption to solve their problems
and  fulfill  their  needs,  time  demanders  will  purchase  time  commodities  and
consumer them in exchange of corresponding service from time exporters.
1.3 Time investors - refer to the crowds whose primarily focus is on the asset
side of the time commodities. From the motivation of acquiring economic benefits
through investments, time investors purchase time commodities from the primary
market and monetize them on the secondary and third markets in order to receive
price premium.
1.4  Time  asset  operators  -  refer  to  companies  and  partnerships  that  are
mutually-benefits to the platform’s ecosystem. Time asset operators bring in high-
quality time assets and introduce time exports trendy on the market, expand to the
large and highly active time demander base, connect prominent time investors.
Their  participation  will  boost  the  construction  and  positively  promote  the
sustainable development of the platform’s ecosystem.
M.I.T platform comprises of time commodity exchange and time asset exchange
markets based upon blockchain technology. All the transaction processes are recorded
in the underlying distributed blockchain ledger. This practice avoids the black-box
manipulations during the operation process, ensures accuracy of ownership rights and
proceeding transitions, allows for transparency of data and a purified transaction
environment. During the transactions, M.I.T will retrieve TNB tokens by announcing
service charge or transaction commissions. The retrieved TNB tokens, apart from the
amounts used for channel fee distributions, daily operation and maintenance of M.I.T
platform, will be regularly sealed and never relieved. By this mean, total supply of TNB
tokens will be gradually reduced.
Meanwhile,  M.I.T  platform  adopts  Grid  public  blockchain  technology  and  largely
5




applies middleware, well-sealed SDK and API to provide business service to third
parties  with  simple  access  and  convenient  transplantation.    The  goal  is  to  fast
cultivate  its  cross-industry  and  cross-border  service  capacity  and  consequently
encourage rapid, orderly and healthy development of the platform ecology.
2. TNB (Time New Bank)
TNB, a.k.a. Time new bank, is a cryptographic digital currency issued by M.I.T, which
enables  transactions  on  M.I.T  time  commodity  exchange  and  M.I.T  time  asset
exchange. M.I.T will mint a total of 6,000,000,000 TNB tokens. No more tokens will be
minted afterwards.    For early-stage investors, TNB serves the purpose of providing
project funding. It could also be used to incentivize individuals or organizations that
contribute to the M.I.T ecosystem. Moreover, TNB will be able to carry the premium
generated self-promotion of time exporters and deliver to the end users. TNB will also
be circulated on third party digital currency exchanges.
PART 3. M.I.T ECOSYSTEM AND BUSINESS LOGICS
1.  Overview of M.I.T Ecosystem
M.I.T connects considerable numbers of high-quality time exporters, mature time asset
operators and investors as well as large volume of time demanders. It commits to
integrate industry resources, bridges trust and delivers value, which is anticipated to
lead the evolvement of the overall industry.
M.I.T platform is comprised of underlying blockchain ledger, M.I.T time commodity
exposition platform (entry portal), M.I.T time commodity issuance platform (primary
market),  M.I.T  time  commodity  exchange                                                    (secondary  market),  M.I.T  time  asset
exchange (third market), APP, DAPP, enterprise service middleware, SDK, API and etc.
TNB will serve as value-conveying instrument within the platform ecology

Illustration of M.I.T Business Logics
2.1                                                                                     M.I.T underlying blockchain ledger, as the core component of M.I.T platform,
shoulders responsibilities e.g. bookkeeping, proof-of-stake and search functions
for the time commodity exchange, time asset exchange and eco-cooperation
partners. It guardians the safety and stability of all the transaction information on
the platform and avoids forged records by human conducts, thus the ownership
of commodities and assets is distinguished clearly and definitely.
2.2                                                                                     M.I.T eco-cooperation partners will be enabled to enlarge their cross-border
business   scope,   achieve   high-efficiency   transaction   and   cost-effective
settlement by purchasing TNB from third party exchange platforms. In addition,
they could acquire TNB as early -stage investors and participate in the internal
TNB settlement system.
2.3                                                                                     By connecting with M.I.T platform, eco-cooperation partners will be able to
introduce large volume of contracted high-quality time exports, time commodities
with proven market value, as to enrich versatile contents for time commodity
market.
2.4                                                                                     Time exports, bonded by signing smart contracts with M.I.T platform, promise to
convert their time to time commodities to allow commodity circulation on the
7




market. Meanwhile, time exporters with strong social impact will attract                fans and
followers from elsewhere to the platform in order to boost transaction activity. As
the next step, M.I.T will then convert time commodities to time assets to enter
trading activities on M.I.T time asset exchange.
2.5                                                                                     Time  demanders  and  time  investors  alike,  are  only  entitled  to  conduct
transactions of time commodities or time assets by possessing certain amount
of  TNB,  which  could  primarily  be  acquired  from  third  party  exchanges.
Throughout the evolvement, the increasing number of time demanders and
investors will undoubtedly promote the demand for TNB, forming an enormous
TNB buy-side market. When total demand for TNB exceeded the supply in
circulation, TNB’s value will be pushed up to create large investment proceeds
for both M.I.T investors and TNB investors.
2.6                                                                                     Time demanders and time investors will be able to purchase time commodities
and assets on M.I.T time commodity exchange and M.I.T time asset exchange
respectively to materialize the commodities or gain investment profits.
2.7                                                                                     By referring to the smart contract, time exports will be able to receive payments
in legal tender or TNB. TNB could be easily converted to real-time gains via third
party  digital  currency  exchange  platforms.  As  the  M.I.T  time  commodity
exposition platform also serves as entry portals for time demanders, it carries

PART 4. TNB DEMAND FORECAST IN M.I.T ECOSYSTEM
The M.I.T team focuses on the resource integration of its platform ecology. Since
initialization, the team has successfully formed strategic cooperation with Miao ’A, the
most trendy decentralized time commodity exchange platform.
Miao’A promises to connect all its core businesses to M.I.T ecosystem. In Miao’A
Chinese version (CN), TNB will gradually replace Miao’A’s virtual currency. For the
ready-to-launch international version (int’l), Miao’A will include TNB as the sole trading
currency.  Meanwhile,  Miao’A’s  existing  clients  and  time  commodities  will  all  be
9




introduced onto M.I.T time commodity exchange.
Based upon Miao’A’s recent operational data, we made the following forecast:
1.                                                                                 Time exports with high-popularity and high-value:
                                                                                  Recently on Miao’A CN, 120+ contracted celebrities and entrepreneurs have
already exported their time commodities, whilst another 100+ contracted
celebrities and entrepreneurs will soon launch their commodities.
                                                                                  On Miao’A Int’l, 10+ A-list international celebrities and entrepreneurs have
expressed  clear  willingness  for  cooperation.  40+  celebrities  are  in  the
pipeline. It is estimated that GMV of Miao’A Int’l’s debut launch will exceed
100,000,000 CNY.
                                                                                  It is anticipated that the number time exporters on M.I.T will reach 300 by
the end of 2017, exceed 500 by 2018, amongst which over 50% will be
comprised of A-list and international celebrities and entrepreneurs.
                                                                                  By the end of 2019, number of contracted time exporters is estimated to
exceed  600, amongst  which over  50% will be comprised of A-list and
international celebrities and entrepreneurs.
2.                                                                                 Large traffic of time demanders will settle on M.I.T by leverage celebrity effects:
                                                                                  By the end of 2017, number of time demanders with transaction records is
estimated to exceed 100,000.
                                                                                  By the end of 2018, number of time demanders with transaction records is
estimated to exceed 600,000.
                                                                                  By the end of 2019, number of time demanders with transaction records is
estimated to exceed 800,000.
3.                                                                                 Increasing number of time demanders will give rise to larger demand for TNB,
which will soon generate a massive TNB buy-side market, pushing up the pricing
of TNB by making it scarce. Assume that annual regard amount per time demander
is 2,000 CNY, the total transaction value of M.I.T is estimated to be:

Note: Recharge currency is CNY in the figures above. The conversion rate of BTC versus
TNB BTC will be approximately at: 1 BTC=465,000 TNB.
PART 5. BLUEPRINT FOR FUTURE GROWTH
Once M.I.T platform ecology is formed, the platform will be able to cater more ordinary
time exports besides high-value celebrities and entrepreneurs. There will be an overlap
between time demanders and exports. As long as an individual’s ability to serve is
being recognized, he/she will be able to monetize his/her time. M.I.T will thrive to make
everyone’s time valuable and realize inclusive self-fulfillment for each individual.
By entering this stage, M.I.T could not only serve its cooperative partners and users,
but also quickly cultivate user habits of utilizing TNB. The applicability of M.I.T will
enable TNB to  cover more  consumption  scenarios  and  introduce  more potential
partners to the platform. The demand for TNB will further boost, so will it be for TNB
trading  price,  bring  along  activeness  on  secondary  market  and  expedite  the
enthusiasm for third market.
PART 6. TECHNOLOGY FEATURES OF M.I.T
1.  The ability to resolve high-concurrent requests
11




M.I.T platform possesses distinctive incubating ability and operates a To-C                  business
model, implying that high-concurrent computing and massive data processing are
technical necessities. In addition, the operation of M.I.T time commodity exchange and
M.I.T time asset exchange calls for an underlying ledger with fast proof -of-stake
capacity. Therefore, after exhausting the applications for various business scenarios,
M.I.T attempts to optimize its systematic design to deal with high-frequency concurrent
visits and select the most suitable model for its underlying blockchain technology. The
platform preliminarily lands on a Grid-based underlying technology, in order to leverage
the  consensus  mechanism and  side-chain  isolation packaging functions  that  the
optimized Grid provides. In this way, M.I.T’s technical solutions will be able to face
potential pressure with dealing high concurrent requests to ensure reliability and
availability of the platform.
2.  Openness and transparency of transaction data
M.I.T links different cooperative enterprises to its proprietary platform. The transaction
data should be transmitted across various industries and enterprises, and also stay
transparent  for  trading  participants.  Hence,  it  is  essential  that  M.I.T  selects
decentralized core underlying ledger system based on the most appropriate public-
chain technology. M.I.T will adopt the data-sensitive multi-signature controlled access
solution which combines public ledgering to ensure transparency for all the trading
participants, amounting to justification of the platform and healthy ecological growth.
3.  Compatibility with established IT systems of different enterprise partners
As many enterprises have already established their operating system or APP terminals,
the design of M.I.T platform ought to fully consider all business scenario applications,
clearly  define  interface  standards  and  interaction  protocols,  to  maximize  its
compatibility with established IT systems of the partners in order to reduce customer
migration risk of and technical risk.
4.  Top-level security guarantee
Concerning commodity trading and transaction, M.I.T takes stringent control over the
data safety and data compliance. Thanks for the accumulation of financial industry
expertise, the team carries out thorough and adequate design and planning of the
12




safety  system,  aided  by  blockchain  technology  properties  such  as  asymmetric
encryption  mechanism,  distributed  data  ledger,  smart  contract  and  tampering
resistance, to form high data safety solution comprised of business management
standards, technical solutions, R&D and production separation.
5.  Excellent scalability
The future is worth looking forward to, yet difficult to grasp and anticipate. In order to
ensure that the M.I.T platform, throughout the evolvement, would always be able to
comply with the most state-of-art business application requirements, the team, since
its establishment, has taken into consideration high scalability, encapsulation and
decoupling for each function module by layers and wide application of middleware, in
order to entitle the M.I.T system with excellent flexibility and scalability.
PART 7. GOVERNANCE OF M.I.T
1.  M.I.T Foundation as the governing body

body of M.I.T which is soon to be established overseas. The Foundation is committed
to  the  development,  construction  and  governance  of  M.I.T,  promoting  the
establishment, evolution and formation of the M.I.T ecological community.
In  order to avoid divergence  in  directions, decisions, and even divisions  among
community members, the foundation will shoulder the responsibility to help manage
general  and  privileged  matters  in  the  community  via  the  establishment  of  a
comprehensive governance structure. The goal for governance structure design of the
Foundation  is  to  maintain  the  sustainability  of  the  ecological  environment,  the
efficiency  of  decision-making  and  the  compliance  of  capital  management.  The
Foundation exercises its day-to-day authority through the policy-making committee.
In the early days of the establishment, in order to expedite operation of the project, the
first policy-making committee members will be composed of M.I.T team members and
representatives of early investors to serve 2-year tenure, after expiration of which
13




committee  members  will  be  re-elected  by  community  voting.  The  policy-making
committee will be made up of 7 members, of whom 4 from the M.I.T team and 3 from
early investors. All decisions are made by implementing the  “5 out of  7” multiple-
signature system.
2.  Commitment for openness
By the end of the ICO, the Foundation will regularly announce the latest development
on the official website to enable early investors, ecosystem participants and end users
to inquire into each function of stage of the business progress.

PART 10. CAPITAL UTILIZATION PLAN
1. R&D: 40%
As an integrated commercial platform with high-concurrency, high-availability and
top-safety features, the technical requirements for construction the M.I.T platform is
massive. In addition, in order to expedite the business ecosystem, it is essential to
lower  the  technology  barriers  of  the  system.  Moreover,  continuous  input  into
middleware,  interface,  SDK,  add-on  development  tools,  APP  and  DAPP
development tools is inevitable. The R&D process will also require large number of
developers. Therefore, M.I.T will invest considerable amount of capital raised for
the molding and development of its basic technology platform.
2. Maintenance and security: 15%
M.I.T time commodity exchange and time asset exchange both require top-level
security guarantee, which calls for high-standard hardware and safety applications.
The maintenance and security requirements are in need for specific optimization,
capital input, as well as scientific management mechanism.
3. Marketing and business operation: 35%
To construct scalable platform ecology in a relatively short period of time, and
comply with more payment scenarios of the end users, M.I.T will need diversified
strategic layout to face the complex business scenarios and different roles in
ecosystem. As a result, the platform calls for large amount of investment into
comprehensive marketing and promotion, business development and operation, in
order to help expedite the ecosystem formation and provide close-loop service for
end users from the early stage.
4. Capital reserve: 10%
The Foundation will set aside a small portion of capital for emergency cases and
other financial expenditure.
