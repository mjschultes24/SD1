INTRODUCTION
Imagine a world without money- it’s hard to fathom. Since the beginning of
civilization, we have lived with cash or alternative forms of it. However, cash and
modern fiat currencies, such as the US Dollar and the British Pound, all have a
fundamental flaw. They are completely based on trust.
While trust works well in strong, stable economies, a substantial part of the world
is composed of developing countries with less stable economies.
When a corrupt government is running out of money, it’s tempting for them to
print more. However, printing money decreases the value of the currency.
Simply put: when the supply of the currency increases, the value is reduced.
Even worse, hyperinflation can set in, causing the currency to become worthless.
Citizens over credulously trust their government to be responsible and not
fabricate more.
Even in developed nations, we still rely on trust. When you send and receive
currencies electronically, you are forced to trust banking institutions to store
records of the transactions. The banks save a digital number (the individual’s
remaining account balance) and informs the receiving bank of the amount of
funds transferred from the initial account. The margin for error, malfeasance,
fraud, and unscrupulous behavior by these institutions is immense. Yet, we are
expected to have the disposition of believing they possess an infallible system
and moral compass.

INTRODUCTION

(cont.)

Since the advent of ATM’s in the 1960’s, we have relied on banks to keep track of
digital transfers. This is due to a huge issue called “Double Problem Spending.”
Everything digital can be copied and we cannot trust people not to duplicate
their money.
That is where cryptocurrency comes into play, solving this issue.
We, as a society, currently depend on banks to keep records updated. However,
cryptocurrencies are not controlled by an organization or an individual.
Cryptocurrency allows every user access to the ledger. Therefore, no single
entity or individual is solely in control of the ledger.
All of the cryptocurrency rules and regulations are defined. Digital currency itself
is an open source which means that everyone who uses the coin, controls the
coin, but there is no single individual in charge.
Cryptocurrency functions with a self management system. It may sound
complicated - because it is, however, it isn’t necessary to dissect or completely
understand the intricacies of technology involved in making a cell phone work
before you enjoy the benefits of its features. That same concept applies with
cryptocurrencies.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 7

INTRODUCTION

(cont.)

Cryptocurrency guarantees security. Funds are stored securely, privately and
numerically. Users can transfer funds around the world instantly at minimal
cost. Cryptocurrencies offer high-level security and anonymity without requiring
a bank to participate and Lindacoin is part of this financial revolution.
There are more than 1600 alternative cryptocurrencies currently in existence,
with a new use case for blockchain emerging every week. But Lindacoin is
unique from all the others. In this whitepaper, we will delve into and describe
what makes Lindacoin a perfect tool to improve your daily life.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 8

LINDACOIN

LINDACOIN
Lindacoin is a peer to peer hybrid digital currency. It creates utility products that
allow Linda to be used in everyday scenarios. It also offers partnership
opportunities to other cryptocurrencies to use the Lindacoin platform.
Lindacoin will be at the forefront of technological innovation in payments,
combining the most robust cryptocurrency network with powerful social network
effects. The technology behind Lindacoin, as a system, guarantees its
independence, security, and scalability. We believe that Lindacoin has the potential
to compete with established salient global payment systems.
Lindacoin also utilizes a “Masternode” which ensures lightning fast secured
transactions, multi-wallets, encrypted messaging, and stealth address for
complete anonymity. Masternodes enable instant transactions in a fraction of a
second, thereby making those transactions suitable for everyday use.
Furthermore, they allow Lindacoin to have a privacy option. This allows
transactions to be completely anonymous, a broadly desired feature of
cryptocurrencies.
Lindacoin’s belief is to provide a healthy blockchain for users. In order to do this,
users are able to keep Linda in their wallet to help generate additional coins for
use. Due to this decentralized event that takes places, users are able to keep some
of the newly generated Linda for their efforts. The algorithm for Linda allows the
users to receive around sixty-eight percent in additional coins over the course of
the year. In the same regard, masternode operators who help process transactions
receive approximately ninety-six percent over the course of the year.

MASTERNODES
(ECO-MINING)
Lindacoin’s use of masternodes enables Linda to have unique features that are not
possible in other cryptocurrencies. Our masternodes do the brunt of the work,
sorting out blocks and managing peers. The Linda community will operate these
masternodes to help keep the network flowing. Our masternodes perform all of the
InstantX and private transactions, and are the heart of our blockchain.
A masternode is simply a Linda full node or a computer wallet that stores the
complete copy of the blockchain in real time. But, the central nodes are considerably
different - they perform more functionalities to give Linda special features.
One example of this is Linda’s extraordinary speed and instant transactions. This
makes Linda transactions suitable for everyone.
Some of the unique functions that these nodes perform are:
● Increasing the confidentiality of transactions
● Making instant transactions
● Participating in governance and voting
● Activating the budget and cash system in cryptos.
Masternodes have huge value in supporting the Linda network. They are part of
what defines Lindacoin from all of the other cryptocurrencies. Making Linda more
efficient, and more prepared for the future.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 14

MASTERNODES
(TurnKey)
Linda’s new mobile wallet and mobile app offers a turnkey solution, changing
the dynamic of which masternodes are implemented to the user. It is now
easier than ever for the Linda community to get involved in operating a
masternode.
Currently, masternodes are extremely difficult to set up unless you’re
technically experienced and leads to users potentially missing out. TurnKey
options are masternodes that are already set up for the user. This is for users
who wish to have a more hands off approach to operating masternodes.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 15

STAKING
Proof of Stake (PoS) is a type of consensus algorithm for public blockchains. It
ensures all wallets have a consensus on all transactions. It also weighs the
economic stake of each wallet, so the more LINDA a wallet has, the more it will
have a say in the public blockchain.
Unlike Bitcoin, where the algorithm rewards participants who solve
cryptographic puzzles (Proof of Work), Linda uses the PoS system. Each wallet
votes on the next block and the voting weight of each validator depends on the
amount of LINDA they hold.
One of the significant benefits of a PoS system is the energy efficiency. Instead of
wasting huge amounts of energy to mine coins, Linda is a more eco-friendly coin,
which means it is more likely to be adopted in the future. Also, a PoS algorithm
reduces the chance of centralization. Other coins are likely to be centralized as all
their miners are controlled by a few people, but this is not possible with Linda.
Finally, a PoS algorithm increases security.
Linda allows all wallets to get involved in staking. By simply holding your coins in
a wallet, Linda will automatically stake your coins for you. Staking helps Linda
stabilize the blockchain and will help Linda verify transactions.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 16

STAKING
Linda PoS algorithm reduces centralization risks, as economies of scale are
much less of an issue. Since the security properties of PoS are not based
on the extrinsic cost of validating the chain, a centralized attack is nearly
impossible and we are free to shard/scale the network in a more
traditional way.
Network nodes will increase as Linda grows, leading to greater distribution
and a higher amount of security. Nodes need to be online in order to stake
blocks, which in turn creates a secure and more distributed network.
Electricity costs are the most important expenses in mining and must be
paid in fiat currencies, but Linda has minimal consumption rates. This
results in an enormous advantage when Linda has a lower energy usage
than traditional cryptocurrencies.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 18

STEALTH
ADDRESSES
Linda offers stealth addresses as a feature of the coin. Integrated within the
blockchain and algorithms, stealth addresses are a method by which additional
security can be granted to the user of a cryptocurrency.
For example, if Receiver X wanted to receive five coins from Sender Y, but did
not want anyone else to learn of the transaction, Receiver X could use a stealth
address. Sender Y would then send the coins to the stealth address. When
Sender Y sends the funds to Receiver X, a unique random address is created
where it will be shown that the funds have gone to the blockchain.
As a result, there is no link between the stealth address and any other
transaction address used by Sender Y. This provides a layer of anonymity
because no one will be able to see how Sender Y spent their money.
On the contrary, if Receiver X had sent his or her public address to Sender Y, they
would be able to see all the details of Receiver X’s wallet. For many, the idea
someone can track the way they spend their money is alarming, and that is why
stealth addresses are so powerful.
With stealth addresses, both the sending and receiving wallets would be
impossible to trace. Stealth addresses are an incredibly powerful tool for any
cryptocurrency that implements them, reassuring users that their transactions
cannot be traced. The Linda Network also offers a “Deep Web Tor Wallet” to
provide additional security and anonymity for our users.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 19

ENCRYPTED
MESSAGING
The Linda Wallet comes with an encrypted messaging system. This means
wallets can message each other with complete security, as the messages are
encrypted on both ends. Only the sender and receiver will be able to read the
message, no one else, not even the Linda team. This creates the utmost security
with top of the line encryption technology.
This messaging system can serve many purposes. For example, if two parties
wish to negotiate on a deal, they don’t have to outsource communication to other
apps. Instead, they can stay on the same platform, making it more convenient. At
Linda, we believe privacy is security and we assure all users of the Linda platform
they have a secure platform to discuss confidential details.
We believe the cryptocurrency of the future is one that can serve the needs of all
people. That is why we have the encrypted messaging system. This means
people can complete all their transaction processes on one platform - the Linda
Platform.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 20

ATOMIC SWAPS
The Atomic Swap is a smart contract technology, powered by cryptography,
allowing parties to exchange cryptocurrencies without the use of a middle-man
exchange. This technology is something we strive to integrate as part of the
Linda wallet and network.
In traditional cryptocurrencies, a trusted third party, such as a cryptocurrency
exchange, is necessary to perform a swap of cryptocurrencies in order to prevent
one party from sending a currency without receiving a currency in return.
Another means of obtaining this decentralized agreement can be done as a
single atomic operation. The atomicity guarantees the new value is calculated
based on up-to-date information. An atomic swap is a proposed feature in
cryptocurrencies, allowing for the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another
without the need for a trusted third party.
Some advantages include:
-

Financial savings by removing exchange transactions.
Wallet to wallet transactions without security concerns of an exchange.
Improved collaboration between cryptocurrencies.
Benefits for merchants to be able to accept a bigger range of cryptos.

ATOMIC SWAPS

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 22

HOT SWAPS
Lindacoin is proud to announce Hot Swaps. In some cases, the user can be
limited while performing atomic swaps based on consensus and the design of
the applied smart contract.
Imagine being able to simply swap your Linda into any other currency, without
any third parties or anyone else to swap with. It’s a new technology and it’s
happening all from within your wallet. Using newly created technology, you can
select the currency you would like to exchange from and the currency you
would like to exchange to. Select the number of coins you want to exchange (in
either currency) and our technology will advise you of the total you need to
exchange. Press accept, type in your external currency address and your
encryption password, and you are done!
Never has coin exchanging been easier to do. Now, the only wait you will have is
on the external coin’s blockchain which, unfortunately, are not as quick as Linda!
Atomic Swaps are becoming outdated - Hot Swaps are the future and it’s
coming!

LINDA X

LINDA X
PLATFORM
Linda X is a decentralized platform used for creating and trading custom digital assets and
currencies. Our platform enables multi-layer networks built to improve the
decentralization of distributed ledgers and users associated. The developer software is
integrated within our main chain creating dynamic token creation platform offering a
variety of DAPPS based on token utility.
Linda X token platform is comprised of a set of tools and commands that helps people put
all necessary aspects of regulations and blockchain technology together efficiently. It would
create the infrastructure for companies to issue their securities on the blockchain in an
easy-to-use application. The platform will allow developers to utilize the Linda X network
launching their own tokens, while supporting (Linda) main blockchain. A good reference to
an existing token platform is Ethereum’s ERC20 platform which has seen a lot of success.
Their tokens have not only thrived, but are used by some of the top cryptocurrencies.
One of the major distinctions with Linda X is the developer support system. Linda will
provide support to all developers that use the Linda X platform. Linda will help with
development, marketing, and the launch of their token on Linda X. This will make Linda X a
more attractive and a more accessible place to host their token.
Another feature of Linda X is the app integration. All tokens will have access to all the
regular services and features of Lindacoin. They will be able to stake their coins, have
mining pools, development security knowing their token is provided a mobile wallet paired
with our other development services. Linda aims to be accepted by major Fortune 500
companies that will integrate geolocation and blockchain. This will complement Linda’s
current geolocation and blockchain solutions.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 25

LINDA X
PLATFORM
Linda will be pre-vetting all token proposals. Unlike other token platforms, Linda will be checking
each token proposal to make sure a list of prerequisites are fulfilled before acceptance into the
development platform. As a result, all tokens on the platform will be credible and trustworthy
tokens to use.
The Linda X runtime architecture focuses on providing security and executing untrusted code by
computers all over the world. Specifically, this project focuses on preventing Denial-of-service
attacks, which have become somewhat common in the cryptocurrency world. Like Ethereum’s
EVM, Linda X ensures programs do not have access to each other’s state, ensuring
communication can be established without any potential interference. A 256-bit register stack,
designed to run the same code exactly as intended. It is the fundamental consensus mechanism
for Linda X.
The new version allows use of scripts on the Linda X Blockchain, built on the WASM or Web
Assembly programming language. The eWASM implementation has multiple benefits. Language
change facilitates script implementation at “near-native speed” by maximizing hardware
capabilities. This will, in turn, lead to several uses that generally entail high performance and
throughput capacity.
Proofs provide the cryptographic data an auditor needs to do its job. In general, auditors know
very little about a log, but despite this limited knowledge, proofs make it possible for an auditor to
verify whether a log is consistent and whether a particular certificate has been appended to the
log. Audit proof lets you verify that a specific certificate has been included in a log. This is a critical
verification task because the Certificate Transparency model demands that all TLS clients reject
any certificates that do not show up in a certificate log.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 26

LINDA X
PLATFORM
The connection is private (or secure) because symmetric cryptography is used to encrypt the
data transmitted. The keys for this symmetric encryption are generated uniquely for each
connection and are based on a shared secret negotiated at the start of the session. The node to
node transactions negotiate the details of which encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys to
use before the first byte of data is transmitted, the negotiated secret is unavailable and cannot be
obtained.
The gas system used to power the Linda X platform is not very different from the use of Kw for
measuring electricity home use. One difference from actual energy market is that the originator
of the transaction sets the price of gas, to which the miner can or not accept. This creates a
market around gas. Its main premise determines calculated value for all computation costs
incurred because of the execution of this transaction. Gas limit refers to the maximum amount of
gas you’re willing to spend on a particular transaction.

Higher gas limits mean that more computational work must be done to execute the smart
contract. Gas limit acts as a safety mechanism to protect users from depleting funds, Gas limit
also combats inflationary periods and is predefined.

The difficulty adjustment algorithm in LindaX tries to keep mining time of the blocks between 10
to 20 sec. If difference in mining time is between 0 to 11 sec. then LindaX tries to increase the
difficulty to mine the block and if difference is 20 sec. or more, then LindaX tries to reduce the
mining difficulty of the system. As a result, you have an algorithm that can determine the perfect
balance of block difficulty in the LindaX ecosystem.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 27

LINDA X
ICO BREAKDOWN
Linda X’s ICO will consist of three subsections privy to the expected set price upon exchange
listing. Producing programs to maximize user involvement within the platform itself prior to
launch date is vital to chain integrity for Linda X. Alongside this, we will be planning an
incentivized referral structure for current Linda holders and new users.
The Linda family will now have two coins: a utility coin (Linda) and an asset-backed coin (Linda
X). Utility will have value because they enable the holder to exchange the coin for a good or
service in the future. An example of a utility coin is Bitcoin. Asset-backed coins (Linda X) may
have value because there is an underlying asset which the holder of the token can attribute value
to. Due to the blockchain structure, Linda X will be used as the GAS of the Linda X network.
The ICO will consist of 50% of the initial pre-mine, then divided within the three subsections.
Each month ICO elements enter a new division allowing previous divisions to already see initial
coin value based on chain enrollment.

PLATFORM Algorithm
Token Development Tools
Smart Algo - A distributed computing platform is a dedicated server used for companies. The
internal concept features smart contract (scripting) functionality solely to approved Linda X
developers or the entities they represent. Smart contracts or smart algos that are high-level
programming abstractions that are compiled down to bytecode and deployed to the Linda X
chain for execution. Smart algorithms can be written in Solidity. The following describes standard
functions a token contract can implement, which will allow dapps and wallets to handle tokens
across multiple interfaces/dapps. The most important are transfer, balance of and the transfer
event. Linda X creates a fully decentralized ecosystem implementing cross chain connections.
The development and application fees must be purchased in (Linda) to create token (Y) while
directly supporting (Linda X) main chain. Gas from Token (Y) also supports (Linda X) thus
effectively establishing cross chains support.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 29

LINDA X
PLATFORM Token Development.
Exclusive development tools will be accessible to all approved Linda X developers, like existing
Ethereum technology administrative reps will be able to administer smart algos that are
defined by the use case or application. The classification Linda X developer is only held to
those companies who have successfully been accepted and fulfilled all prerequisites.
All tokens must enter Linda’s partner exchange by the given date submitted on the initial
application. Failure to fulfill token completion could lead to the delisting of your company and
token or requested community override. Full consultations regarding coin build can be
requested alongside whitepaper development if needed. Linda X ensures all approved tokens
will also gain a guaranteed listing in an exchange with Linda’s partner removing the
speculation associated with other token platforms.
Encrypted signature keys will be used to ensure no access is given to the development
platform until accepted and approved by our legal administration. The software is private and
not available to the public reducing the risk assessment with underlying companies before the
listing process. (Note) All tokens must enter the exchange by the date submitted during the
application process. Our main client provides decentralized application tools much like
ethereum's examples, including games, managing identities, development of building,
microblogging ,medical records, geolocation tools, user incentive programs, location tracking,
data collection and many other use cases.

LINDA X
PLATFORM Exchanges

Exchanges and their place within the Linda family
By partnering with exchanges, we have the ability to provide a safe, low cost form of
liquidity for all tokens created on LindaX. This allows us to help remove the trouble
of having to communicate with and pay extravagant listing fees that have become all
too common in the crypto-sphere.
Working together with LindaX, exchanges will list each token made on our token
creation platform with advantageous pairs right out of the box. This will be a key
feature of the token platform moving forward and will help each and every token or
ICO made with LindaX to flourish.
One of the most difficult aspects of creating a successful token other than creating
an idea that will solve real world problems is the trouble associated with getting your
token listed on exchanges and creating enough volume to gain interest. LindaX
makes this process easy as we will find exchanges for the token.

Li nda is partnering with the Pro Battle League to present the first token to be
created on the Linda X Platform - Battle7oken. Battle7oken will be the main
currency of the Pro Battle League, a North American gaming league.
The Battle7oken is a great example of how Linda X can revolutioniize a
business. Battle7oken (B7) is creating a revolutionary platform focused on
the creation of a more dynamic esports environment. The Linda X Platform
will allow PBL to create key elements that have been overlooked in esports,
including geolocation applications. Empowered with new tools, the Pro Battle
League will drive local esports development for the first time, unlocking a vital
growth opportunity.

WALLET

LINDACOIN WALLET
The Linda wallet is unique from the wallets of many popular coins out there. At
Linda, we strive to continually adapt and improve our product in many ways,
usually influenced by the community’s recommendations.
The community’s opinion is of the utmost importance to us and we continually
use their voice as a tool to integrate and innovate new features into the coin.
Linda strives to be a community leader, establishing standards set forth by every
user of Linda coin, but exceeding them in every way possible.
Due to our community’s needs, Linda will perform several much needed changes
and overhauls to the wallet during Q3 and Q4 of 2018. During and leading up to
this period, we will continue to ask the community what features are most
needed and wanted. The focus will be on reducing CPU and RAM requirements,
as well as minimizing the amount of bandwidth required to use the wallet.
This, along with some much needed RPC upgrades in order to facilitate easier
masternode creation and usage, as well as a much needed overhaul of the
masternode list. One upcoming feature is the addition of a masternode active
icon to our wallet, so users may see easily whether their masternode is online.
Included will also be a complete graphical overhaul. This will help Linda achieve
the sleek look her technology deserves. Exciting features are new skins and fan
art backgrounds.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 36

LINDACOIN
WEB WALLET
The Linda Web Wallet is a key component of the Linda software family.
Traditionally, cryptocurrencies only offer a desktop wallet which can be hard to
set up and operate, and ultimately discourages many potential cryptocurrency
users.
On the other hand, Linda’s online wallet enables users the features of a
traditional desktop wallet without the hassles of running a server or setting up a
desktop wallet. It will still have all your favorite features from the desktop wallet.
The web wallet includes the staking capability, masternode capability, and even
multiple masternode capability. Now anyone can start staking and running a
masternode, and even you can get in on the rewards!
Better yet, the web wallet has enhanced masternode capabilities. It allows Linda
adopters to not only set up with a few clicks, but it offers heightened security and
fast connections. This lets our users have peace-of-mind, knowing that the
online wallet is safe and secure.
The web wallet also has an easy-to-use system. This allows all transactions to be
private and it hides your ip address, making you untraceable when using Linda.
The web wallet also has a lite edition. This gives amateur Linda users an
easy-to-use platform. They can use the wallet for day to day transactions,
without all the staking and masternode capabilities.

LINDACOIN
MOBILE APP.
The mobile application will absolutely revolutionize Lindacoin’s development. In
today’s society, mobile apps play a large part in our daily lives. That’s why Linda
has developed a mobile app for users to manage their wallets from the
convenience of their phones. The mobile app will have all the features of the
desktop wallet, except it allows users to bring the app anywhere.
The mobile app reinforces the real world application of Linda as a currency. A
huge flaw with current cryptocurrencies is the lack of a mobile app wallet. It is
impossible to pay for goods in real life, if you can only use your desktop wallet.
When Linda gets accepted by merchants around the world, Linda will need a
portable way to pay, and that’s where the mobile app steps in.
Furthermore, the mobile app allows users to check in with their Linda
transactions and balance. We know that our users are busy, and that’s why we
offer the convenience of checking in on their wallet, from the convenience of
their mobile device.

Our new mobile app will be available for purchase on both Android and IOS.
This will allow everyone to enjoy mobile stake rewards at the convenience of
never missing out on what their Linda is doing. All the while never having to
worry about data usage nor bandwidth restrictions.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 39

MOBILE
MASTERNODES
Mobile Masternodes: Masternodes are paid by the network for the governance services they provide. Due to the
selection algorithm, there is always an aspect of randomness to payment selection, but in the long term all
masternode owners will receive similar payments. Having so many servers holding a full copy of the blockchain and
working for the coin can be extremely useful. Masternodes guarantee that transactions are validated and confirmed in
real time, which makes them highly efficient for the blockchain network and ecosystem. The financial rewards
provided through setting up and operating a masternode has allowed more parties to be involved with the
cryptocurrency, thus making a shift towards a more decentralized approach. Lindacoin has brought this same
technology to your mobile phone.

VPS Security SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the National
Security Agency (NSA). SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm. Cryptographic hash functions are mathematical
operations run on digital data; by comparing the computed "hash" (the output from execution of the algorithm) to a
known and expected hash value, a person can determine the data. The communication between the user and their
VPS now happens over SSL (wss) AND end to end encryption. The SSL keeps the app up-to-date with current web
standards and protects the user’s packets on local networks. The end-to-end encryption protects the user’s packets
right down to their machine. If you have a virus or someone has access to your logged in wallet there's no way for
them to gain any data sent between you and your VPS.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 40

LINDACOIN
STAKING POOL
A feature of the Lindacoin wallet is the Lindacoin staking pool. Users can
contribute to a community pool of Linda, which will stake. The rewards from
staking will then be paid back to the contributors of the pool.
The Lindacoin staking pool provides accessibility to the staking feature. Many
users who have a small amount of Linda will find it hard to stake, due to the
nature of staking. But, since these people can stake together, the more casual
Lindacoin users will be able to stake efficiently. This means the staking feature
will be accessible to all, and everyone has the opportunity to get involved in
helping Linda run smoothly.
In sum, Linda will be more decentralized. Since its staking network is distributed
amongst all the users, and not only those who hold a lot of Linda, we can ensure
that the fate of the blockchain isn’t all in one person’s hands, and instead, it is in
the hands of the people.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 41

STAKING OTHER
PoS COINS
In addition to being able to stake your Linda, the Linda web wallet also allows you
to stake other coins. Linda will be reaching out to other PoS cryptocurrencies for
offers to be integrated on the Linda platform. Furthermore, all tokens created on
the Linda X platform will be able to be staked from the Linda wallet.
As a result of this technological breakthrough, your Linda wallet is the only wallet
you'll ever need. Linda provides the utility in the tool to invest in other
cryptocurrencies directly through the Linda platform. This will make Linda the
future cryptocurrency, since it is not dependant on any other cryptocurrency and
it has all the tools you need readily available at your fingertips.
On top of this, we are also listing non PoS coins, in order to allow them access on
our mobile and iOS wallets. This is a big feature for some small (And big!) cap
coins that do not have their own mobile wallets.
Below are a few of our current coin listings.

LINDACOIN COLD
STORAGE CARDS
Lindacoin has partnered with whopper.io to deliver Linda cold storage cards.
While a mobile wallet suits day to day transactions, a cold storage card is better
for long term storage. Completely offline from the internet or your computer, it
cannot be hacked, and therefore your Linda cannot be stolen.
This makes cold storage cards perfect for long term storage. Essentially, this can
act as your savings account, while your day to day wallet is your checking
account.

APPLICATIONS
OF LINDACOIN
3. Token Creation Platform.

1. Decentralized Payments.
The major application of Lindacoin is
to facilitate payments. It offers a
decentralized payment network,
which eliminates the middle-man
from financial transactions. With so
many features, Lindacoin is also
more convenient than traditional
payment systems.
2. Blockchain Solutions
Linda’s blockchain technology is a
huge application of Linda. Linda is
able to create programs that rely on
Linda’s blockchain. While they have
a variety of applications, blockchain
solutions will make things run
smoother, faster, and safer. Linda
can be used by corporations to
improve their business operations,
and we see this as being a huge
application of Lindacoin.

The LindaX platform is a huge
application of Linda. It allows
developers to use the Linda network to
create and host their own tokens. This
means existing companies, and those
of the future, will be using Linda to
optimize blockchain technology, and
that Lindacoin will be the coin that runs
it all.
4. Anonymous Payments.
Linda’s stealth addresses and
encrypted messaging features make
Linda the platform for anonymous
payments. This is a huge application,
and there are many reasons why
people desire anonymity in their
payment systems. Current financial
transaction methods do not offer this,
so people will be using Linda to
conduct their private transactions.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 55

DEVELOPMENT
OF LINDACOIN
Lindacoin is an open-source project that anyone can contribute to. Although the
Linda community volunteers are a huge part of development, we still have our
own in-house development team. This will ensure Linda is constantly improving
at a lightning fast speed.
The Linda team and Chief of Development will ensure Linda has a team of
developers that will work hard to bring new features to Linda. The team will work
together to develop new concepts and features, and the developers will be able
to create it. This is how Linda ensures constant new features and improvement.
Also, our community is able to help us develop Linda. Anyone can contribute to
Lindacoin’s code, through GitHub. It’s a very simple process that makes sure
anyone can contribute and help make Linda the future cryptocurrency.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 56

MARKETING
OF LINDACOIN
Linda firmly believes in marketing as one of our core development strategies.
Regardless of how advanced Lindacoin is, success is contingent on proper
marketing. Lindacoin will focus on both forms of marketing - natural and
artificial. Here are the strategies Linda will implement in our marketing plan.
For natural marketing, our focus is on creating phenomenal products and
engaging with our community. Our technique will include continuing to build
credibility and satisfying our core community’s aspirations. While applying this
strategy, we will deliver high quality products and consistent developmental
upgrades. This will cause word of mouth advertising to spread individually,
simultaneously generating secure and organic growth. By ensuring Linda’s users
are happy and fulfilled, Linda is utilizing the most powerful form of marketing
available.
Although incredibly effective, natural marketing will not be completely sufficient,
and Linda always strives for excellence. So, Linda will also implement artificial
marketing strategies. Employing sophisticated methods to create online
advertisements targeting receptive and interested audiences, based on data
collection of our intended demographic. Linda will contribute proficient
community outreach programs, and collaborate with influential community
members. Publishing press releases, interviews, articles, and live interactive Q&A
sessions will provide additional strength to our foundation.

SCALABILITY
OF LINDACOIN
There are many long-term goals Linda strives to achieve. Ultimately, our goal is
to continue to operate as an accomplished company, and provide products and
tools that are beneficial long term to our users.
We have already gone to great lengths to keep our coin prosperous far into the
future. With LindaV2’s optimization and anti-inflationary measures, we can
safely continue at the same level of ROI untouched, until late in 2030 - This gives
plenty of time for advancement in our coin technology that will help further the
longevity of Lindacoin.
This, compounded with mandating that the only way to purchase LindaX is
through Linda, allows us to ensure a healthy network and volume amount for
years to come, despite what project is leading in the developmental sphere. This
provides a form of safety net in that no matter what direction we take, there will
always be significant volume in order to continue having Linda be almost
instantaneous and easy to use, unlike the popular BTC.
Along with all of the aforementioned information, we are also diligently working
to create valid revenue streams within our company. Examples, like our Web
Staking Platform and the Official Linda Pool, will provide us secure funding for
continuing to expand and develop Lindacoin and our affiliated projects for long
into the coming future.

ROADMAP
AT A GLANCE

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 59

ROADMAP
LindaV2
A lot of the software developed for Linda in the prototype stages need to be
refurbished. Like a real product, the prototype is simply to show the uses of the
product, but the real product needs to be made more appealing to the public and
more accessible. At this stage, the Linda software will be refurbished to make it
more accessible and user-friendly for the public, as it is now ready to be used by
the public.
Mobile App
First of all, the Linda wallet family will be redone. Not only will the current
desktop app be made more intuitive and accessible, but Linda will be adding a
mobile and online wallet. The mobile app and online wallet have all the functions
that a regular wallet has, but they are easier to set up. With a few clicks in your
explorer, you can now open a Linda wallet. Furthermore, a mobile wallet allows
people to carry their Linda everywhere they go, making Linda the true payment
network. These will make Linda more accessible to the public, and a superior
cryptocurrency for the future.
Block Explorer
Finally, Linda will be releasing an official block explorer to the public. A block
explorer allows anyone to view the blockchain. Now that the public will be using
Linda as a payment method, they deserve transparency of the blockchain
through the block explorer.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 60

ROADMAP
Linda Scalability
Linda plans to improve overall scalability. Our network scalability is the
capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of
work, or its potential to be enlarged in order to accommodate that growth.
We can refer to the capability of a system to increase its total output under
an increased load when resources are added.
Token Application
Linda will be pre-vetting all tokens. Unlike other token platforms that host
scam tokens, Linda will be checking each token to make sure no scams are
on the Linda network. This means Linda will become a trustworthy and
credible cryptocurrency.
Token Development
A major distinction that sets Linda apart from other token platforms is the
developer support system. Linda will provide support to all developers that
use the Linda X platform. The team will help with development, marketing,
and the launch of their token on Linda X. This will make Linda X a more
attractive and easier place to host their token.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 61

ROADMAP
LindaX Launch
At its core, LindaX is a decentralized platform that supports the creation,
exchange and distribution of custom digital assets, smart-contracts and
applications. The platform has a developer-centric curation process
intended to ensure all tokens meet and exceed the expected quality
standard that further increases the potential for global trust and adoption.
Decentralized Applications Dapps
Here at Linda, we will also be developing over time a wide variety of Dapps
and developer tools that run alongside or on top of our blockchain. This will
not only help with the creation of tokens, chain staking, masternodes, but
will also help businesses build the exact type of Dapp they’re looking for. We
plan on developing many exclusive Dapps further in 2019.
Token Listing
Our extensive listing and vetting process for token proposals will open to the
public in the beginning of 2019. This will allow us to garner lots of attention,
ensure that the type of applications we are receiving are well done, and have
fully structured ideas. We are also going to be rolling out a support process
for coins to gain some help in order to steer them on the right path towards
success on our platform.

LINDACOIN WHITEPAPER - Pg. 62

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, Linda will be establishing a multifunctional platform, enabling
individuals to benefit from the utilities of real world application. Lindacoin’s
main objective is implementing a structure in compliance with mass adoption
and acceptance. Perseverance and determination define Lindacoin’s integrity,
and fuels our motivation to offer innovative technological solutions that are
