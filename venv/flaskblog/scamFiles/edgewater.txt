ABSTRACT
Currently, the market landscape for trading digital assets is disjointed and riddled with latency
and inefficiencies. This dynamic is a constant frustration for participants.  For professional money
managers   to confidently enter the virtual currency space, accessing digital asset liquidity
needs to be simplified, highly secure and compliant.
Leveraging the proprietary technology, business processes and institutional trading expertise of
Edgewater Markets LLC and utilizing our team’s decades of experience in currency trading,
technology and global financial services management, The Company is building a best-in-class
institutional digital asset trading platform to meet the requirements of professional money
managers and traders globally.
Edgewater Digital Technologies is leveraging the blueprint of Edgewater Markets successful fiat
currency trading business to develop trading efficiencies, increase transparency and reduce
execution costs in the digital asset markets. Edgewater Markets’ existing global network with data
centers in New York, London, Tokyo and Mexico City provides secure, low latency connectivity
for hundreds of fiat customers and liquidity providers in over 50 countries globally.   Modifying
Edgewater’s existing electronic trading infrastructure and developing innovations tailored to the
digital asset markets will accelerate institutional participation.
Time-tested business processes and institutional currency trading expertise will enable the
Edgewater team to create a best-in-class digital asset trading platform to meet the requirements
and expectations of institutional investors.  With  offices  in  New  York,  London,  Chicago,
Singapore, Mexico City and Santiago, Chile, we believe Edgewater’s trading infrastructure and
existing institutional customer base will play a significant role in the growth of the digital asset
class and is uniquely positioned to solve the issues faced by institutional traders and investors.
Edgewater Digital Technologies, formed January 16, 2019, is a corporation incorporated under the
laws of Delaware in the United States.  The Company was created to implement the business
strategy outlined in this Whitepaper and develop the technology supporting the strategy.  The
Company is pre-revenue and has no operating history.
Unless the context suggests otherwise, as used herein, “we”, “us”, “our” and similar terms refer to
the Company, the Platform Operator and Edgewater collectively.

INTRODUCTION
Digital asset trading began with the launch of Bitcoin in 2009. In less than 10 years, the digital asset
market has grown to over $100 billion total market cap, with over 100 individual digital assets each
valued at over $30 million1.  It has been estimated that the cryptocurrency market could reach $10
trillion total market cap or more over the next 10 years2 as the disruptive potential of blockchain
technology attracts institutional investors globally.
As of April 2018, there are over 250 digital asset hedge funds with $3.5 billion to $5 billion in assets
under management3.  Industry leaders anticipate more than 1000 hedge funds will get involved, as
asset managers seek exposure to cryptocurrencies.   As further evidence of institutional demand,
Thomson Reuters published a survey of their trading clients in April 20184 and found that “over 20
percent of the survey participants are actively investigating launching a cryptocurrency trading
function within the next three to six months.”
We believe the proliferation and growth of digital assets presents an opportunity similar to the
evolution of the fiat currency market. The introduction of aggregation technology in the past 15 years
has made fiat currency markets dramatically more efficient with global average daily volume (ADV)
of over $5 trillion5.  In the past 10 years, deployment of innovative technology, the growth of non-
traditional tech-agile trading firms such as Edgewater Markets and simplified credit and settlement
has reduced fiat liquidity fragmentation, resulting in greater price discovery for traders and has
accelerated trading volume growth.
The rapid expansion of cryptocurrency markets with increasing institutional interest comes with its
own set of challenges. The infrastructure required to support institutional investor access to the
digital asset market is in the early stages of being established. There have been some important
developments, including the launch of futures contracts (CME and CBOE) and the establishment
of numerous exchanges and OTC desks that support cryptocurrency trading.   However, moving
traditional financial institutions from the sidelines will require a more efficient trading and investing
ecosystem before they are comfortable incorporating digital assets into their portfolios.

CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS
EXCHANGE ACCESS:
There are presently over 100 crypto exchanges6 and new entities are entering the space rapidly.
There is little consistency across exchanges7 and coin/token availability varies from exchange to
exchange, different exchanges quote different rates for the same coin/token and transaction costs
and execution confirmation times vary greatly. Setting up multiple accounts to trade across different
digital assets is complex and time consuming. Further, resolving security gaps and moving towards
fully integrated pre-trade credit confirmation, with secure settlement and custody is requisite for
maintaining institutional operational best practices. Institutional investors must have confidence in
the end-to-end solution in order to adhere to their due diligence and fiduciary compliance
responsibilities.
FRAGMENTATION:
Similar to the fiat currency market, the cryptocurrency market is highly fragmented with market
participants located in de-centralized locations around the world.  Latency in execution and
confirmation is a serious issue, especially when attempting to execute large buy/sell orders across
multiple crypto exchanges. Providing access to this multi-plex, distributed   marketplace with
minimal latency requires a sophisticated, secure and reliable global network that is available 24x7.
DEPTH OF LIQUIDITY:
Large institutional investors with sizable orders can significantly affect prices on any individual
exchange, increasing volatility and resulting in order execution slippage. For example, in June
2017 a flash crash occurred in GDAX when Ethereum prices fell more than 95% due to a single
large trade8. This problem does not exist to the same extent for fiat currencies and other asset
classes. The digital asset market presently lacks a global centralized order book with transparent
prices which would help facilitate the higher volume trading that institutional investors require.
TRANSPARENCY:
Market data is a critical component of institutional investors’ trading systems. It is considered the
life blood of any financial ecosystem. The digital asset market suffers from a lack of reliable and
timely data that would give institutional investors a basis to analyze, invest in and trade the
burgeoning market.

EXECUTION COSTS:
Costs are not uniform across exchanges and market makers.   Trading commissions (exchange
and OTC fees) alone can vary from 0.1% to over 4%9.   Total execution cost, which includes the
cost of the bid/ask spread and slippage, is highly variable. There is presently no platform that
efficiently processes orders from a global consolidated order book across multiple exchanges and
OTC desks.  Moreover, calculating the total cost of execution prior to choosing execution venues
is important to facilitate best execution required by institutional investors.

THE EDGEWATER SOLUTION
Edgewater Markets currently provides institutional currency managers and traders a robust,
secure, and scalable platform to consume fragmented market data for trading fiat currencies in
large size efficiently. Edgewater Market’s battle-tested, proprietary technology has been serving
institutional customers for over 10 years and is uniquely positioned to solve the issues faced by
institutional money managers and traders in the digital asset space.
Edgewater’s proprietary trading technology helps customers improve price discovery and reduce
the cost of trading. Edgewater’s global network with data centers located in Asia, Europe and the
Americas provides secure, low latency connectivity for hundreds of customers and liquidity
providers in over 50 developed and emerging market countries.
Edgewater has been developing its infrastructure and proprietary technology to design a global
trading network for digital assets. Established business processes and institutional trading expertise
will enable the Edgewater team to deliver a best-in-class platform to meet the requirements and
expectations of professional money managers and traders who are investing in the cryptocurrency
ecosystem. We believe Edgewater’s electronic trading infrastructure will play a significant role in
the maturation and growth of the digital asset class.
Institutional Trading Expertise
Edgewater understands the requirements of institutional investors.  Professional money managers
and traders have critical requirements, including efficient execution of trading strategies (“Best
Execution”), secure and compliant business processes (“Security and Compliance”) and immediate
customer  service                                                                                                                            (“Accessibility  and  Responsiveness”).    Edgewater  is  leveraging  its  deep
understanding of these institutional requirements to develop a best-in-class digital asset trading
service.
Best Execution
Edgewater Digital is developing a web-based trading platform, Crypto Prime Trader™ (CPT™), that
provides fast and efficient execution supported by low latency access to crypto exchanges globally.
The Platform Operator will provide a consolidated order book of tradable prices for major digital
assets.   CPT includes easy to use order functionality, advanced analytics, charting, trading
algorithms, position and P&L monitoring.   In addition, mobile access and post-trade integration to
back-office systems will be provided.
To achieve this, the Platform Operator is developing the next version of Edgewater’s Vision
System™ for digital assets.   The Platform Operator is developing its Vision Rate Engine™ and

Vision Smart Order Router™ presently utilized by institutional fiat currency traders to deploy a digital
asset trading engine that is designed for fast, efficient execution of large orders across multiple
exchanges.   To facilitate this, the Platform Operator is connecting its Vision Exchange Data
Gateway™ via low latency connectivity to crypto exchanges worldwide.
Security & Compliance
Edgewater has undergone compliance and security reviews by major institutional investors
continuously over the past                                                                                                                   10 years in order to comply with their regulatory and fiduciary
responsibilities.   Edgewater Markets began business in 2009 during the global credit crisis, when
the Lehman Brothers failure, AIG bailout and Madoff scandal were rippling through the markets.
Throughout that period and after, Edgewater has navigated and adapted to evolving market
conditions, newly adopted rules and regulations, including Dodd-Frank in the US and MIFID II in
Europe, to continue providing uninterrupted service to its customers.
In deploying its digital asset trading solution, the Platform Operator will utilize similar best-in-class
security currently used to protect Edgewater’s infrastructure and assets.   Edgewater’s network
security is comprised of hardware, software, policies and procedures that defend against all threats.
Edgewater’s infrastructure is placed in highly secure data centers with hot back-up facilities that
ensure business continuity. Edgewater’s connectivity employs highly secure digital connections,
from the Vision Exchange Gateway through to the network endpoints.  The Platform Operator will
employ the best available technology solutions to ensure the security of the system and customer
trading.
Being adept at understanding and adapting to changing market conditions, as well as technological
and security advancements is critical to adapting to unforeseen circumstances and providing a
sustainable  service.    In  addition,  understanding  and  adhering  to  operating  standards  and
regulations remains a critical component of Edgewater’s success that will continue in the rapidly
developing digital asset marketplace.  As such, the Platform Operator will employ relevant domain
expertise and resources to manage compliance and ensure best practices in all aspects of its
business.
Accessibility and Responsiveness
Professional traders require world class service with immediate accessibility to professional and
informed support personnel.   This could be as simple as help with logging into the system, to
confirming positions - and all steps in between.  Supporting institutional investors/traders requires
a well-trained team that is available immediately by phone 24x7.
Transparency, end-to-end confirmation, security and conforming to record keeping requirements
are paramount. The systems and processes designed to support these requirements must be
managed by knowledgeable staff who are readily available to customers.   The Platform Operator
pg. 9

written consent of Edgewater Digital Technologies Inc.




will establish a new standard for service with multi-lingual (including Japanese, Korean, Chinese,
Spanish) institutional quality, live customer service that does not presently exist in the digital asset
market.
Business Processes
Edgewater has built an organization, established procedures and developed relationships over
many years that are critical components to providing sustainable quality service in a competitive,
global marketplace.   This includes a network of customer, partner and vendor relationships
managed by experienced market professionals around the world.
To achieve operational excellence and to comply with regulatory requirements, the Edgewater team
maintains, and the Platform Operator will benefit from, living documents with detailed operational
procedures and business continuity plans, supported by extensive and ongoing staff training, to
ensure continuing operations in all situations.
Edgewater  employs  a                                                                                                                        “follow  the  sun”  model  where  operational  and  customer  service
responsibilities are passed from time zone to time zone around the clock daily: New York >
Singapore > London > New York.   This ensures that experienced, professional staff are available
24 hours per day to monitor systems and provide immediate customer support. With expertise in
technology, operations, compliance, marketing and sales, Edgewater intends to build out a
successful digital asset trading product through the Platform Operator.
Technology
The Platform Operator’s next generation trading infrastructure along with innovations in the digital
asset markets will accelerate the development of institutional participation.  Edgewater’s proprietary
infrastructure provides aggregated currency rates from hundreds of liquidity providers globally via
strategically located data centers across the Americas, Europe and Asia.
Edgewater infrastructure provides advanced analytics, intelligent algorithmic trading capabilities,
customer-specific liquidity provision, pre-trade credit confirmation and execution settings with low
latency delivery to institutional investors globally.   Edgewater infrastructure includes a proprietary
Rate Engine and Smart Order Router (SOR), central limit order book (CLOB), market data gateway,
co-located infrastructure and low latency connectivity (based on FIX standards) in every region,
supported by highly secure administrative tools and analytics.
The Platform Operator is developing a web and mobile based trading platform Crypto Prime Trader
(CPT) to provide investors and traders with access to crypto exchanges globally. CPT will provide
customers with a consolidated order book - traders will have the best buy/sell rates available
globally for all major crypto coins/tokens in the sizes that they require, improving price discovery
and saving execution costs.  With mobile access, the Platform Operator’s customers will have the

majority of crypto liquidity available in the palm of their hand.

PRODUCT
The Company aims to create the pre-eminent digital asset trading platform to meet the requirements
of institutional asset managers and traders globally.   Edgewater Markets, through the Platform
Operator, is modifying its proprietary infrastructure and developing a web-based trading platform to
meet the requirements of digital asset markets.  Edgewater will launch additional ancillary products
as described below in phase two.
Edgewater Vision Infrastructure
Edgewater’s Vision System™ is comprised of five proprietary components: a) market and order
data gateway (“Vision Exchange Gateway”™), b) rate engine and smart order router (“Vision Rate
Engine and Vision SOR”™), c) central limit order book (“Vision CLOB”), d) web-based trading
service  (“Crypto Prime Trader”™) and e) integration with the customer’s pre and post-trade
solutions to meet institutional compliance and reporting requirements                                                                        (“Crypto Prime Trader
Solutions”™).
As a complete end-to-end institutional technology solution, Vision aggregates many liquidity
sources (applying customer-specific credit and execution rules), distributes executable rates and
advanced trading support tools while flexibly integrating with customers’ existing trading platforms,
thereby enhancing price discovery to enable more efficient trading and cost savings for institutional
investors/traders globally.   Vision provides our customers with clarity to efficiently realize market
opportunities and receive best execution.

Vision Exchange Gateway™
Liquidity sources are in disparate locations globally, requiring advanced, distributed networking and
low latency connectivity which will give customers an advantage in accessing exchange liquidity
and executing trades.
Edgewater has developed proprietary technology to aggregate market and order data utilizing
industry standard FIX specifications deployed globally in data centers in every region (Tokyo,
London, Mexico City and New York).   This allows Edgewater to locate as close as possible to
exchange providers and customers, reducing latency in receiving pre-trade credit and market data
as well as reducing time to execute orders.   To facilitate this, Edgewater has developed a
standardized application programming interface to integrate with various exchanges (based on
standard FIX API).  Wherever possible, co-located equipment and cross-connects are used within
data centers to eliminate latency.   When connecting remotely, low latency data circuits (such as
fiber or microwave where possible) or secure internet connections are utilized.   Market data is
normalized, aggregated and fed into the Vision Rate Engine.
Vision Exchange Gateway Eco-System
Hardware: Each hop in signal propagation incurs latency due to issues such as amplification, packet
routing, queuing, and security.  Our experience in fiat currency markets has led us to develop fast,

reliable, and proven solutions that will be deployed in the digital asset market.
Proximity: When possible, systems are co-located to minimize latency due to distance. As it's not
economical to be co-located with every system, in such cases other low latency connectivity options
will be deployed.
Connectivity: Fiber optic and microwave are the obvious contenders for remote connectivity, each
with cost/performance trade-offs.   Our deep experience with both options allows us to tactically
deploy tailored solutions.
Latency: Leveraging proximity with the integration of hardware and connectivity will minimize
latencies (for example, 8.02 milliseconds from Aurora, IL (CME) to Secaucus, NJ (NYSE) and 67.39
milliseconds from Chicago, IL to Frankfurt, Germany (EUREX).
Vision Trading Engine
The Vision Rate Engine, Smart Order Router (SOR) and Administrative Management System are
the heart of the Vision infrastructure, reducing liquidity fragmentation, increasing trading efficiency
and dramatically reducing executions costs.
Vision Rate Engine and SOR
With aggregated market data and pre-trade credit confirmation (PTCC), the proprietary Vision Rate
Engine produces a consolidated order book for all major crypto coins/tokens, generating customer
specific  executable  quotes.    The  Vision  SOR  routes  orders  based  on  customers’ unique
requirements, incorporating credit availability, Exchange Cost Analysis (ECA™), market conditions
and other customer-specific settings. The consolidated order book provides best bid/offer rates in
various sizes for different execution settings for each customer.
Vision is an advanced technology platform residing in a Linux environment with best-in-class
functionality for facilitating data across open and proprietary protocols such as POSIX shared

order parameters entered by the trader.   Trades are executed instantly, to avoid significant price
changes due to market movement.  Vision Rate Engine and SOR conducts simultaneous automated
checks on multiple market conditions and alerts traders to orders entered outside of pre-set bands,
reducing the risk of errors in placing the trades.

mid-point at standard intervals thereafter.   These mark-outs are measured for individual
customers in order to gauge market impact, which informs settings for future trades.   The
analysis is done by exchange, by digital asset, time zone, etc. to optimize execution.
Vision Central Limit Order Book (“Vision CLOB”)
The Platform Operator will match crossing buy and sell orders whenever possible, thereby
minimizing market impact and saving customers time and execution costs.   Generating CLOB
volume will require trading volume on CPT whereby opposing orders exist in the system at the same
pg. 16
This document is proprietary and confidential.  No part of this document may be disclosed in any manner to a third party without the prior
written consent of Edgewater Digital Technologies Inc.




time and can be matched in a fast, efficient manner.    As volume grows on the Vision System, the
CLOB operation will become an increasingly important liquidity advantage offered by Edgewater
that does not exist on competing systems.
Matching of buyers/sellers significantly lowers market impact and execution costs while reducing
the time for traders to execute into or out of positions.
Web-based Trading Platform Crypto Prime Trader™
The Platform Operator will provide customers with a web-based trading platform, Crypto Prime
Trader (CPT), with a simple, easy-to-use, graphical user interface (GUI).   CPT will incorporate
advanced analytics, charting, trading algorithms, position monitoring, real-time P&L, mobile access
and post-trade integration.  Supported by a 24x7 global help desk with professional trading support
staff, the Platform Operator will provide the institutional market with the most advanced digital asset
trading system available with aggregated liquidity and immediate response to all customer inquiries,
establishing a new bar for customer service in the digital asset market.   The Platform Operator’s
CPT puts traders in control, providing access to reliable digital asset liquidity in the palm of their
hand.
a.  Crypto Prime Trader
The Platform Operator trading platform development employs the concept of KSE™ (Key Stroke
Efficiency™) which is an outcome of Edgewater’s institutional customer advisor group.   Periodic
meetings are held with the Platform Operator’s customer advisor group to review trading platform
developments.  The participating traders provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.  The
objective of KSE is to continuously minimize key strokes, to manage risk and make execution
efficient and error free.
CPT provides traders with a control panel and dashboard to manage execution settings and view
all relevant trading information, including market data, charting, TCA analytics, positions and P&L.
pg. 17
This document is proprietary and confidential.  No part of this document may be disclosed in any manner to a third party without the prior
written consent of Edgewater Digital Technologies Inc.




Traders can select from different order types                                                                                                (for example, FOK, IOC, limit, etc.*), liquidity
composition (for example, ESP, RFQ/RFS, etc.*) and time in force (TIF).   In addition to the live
system, the Platform Operator will make available a UAT/Demo version with live prices and demo
dealing capabilities for training and review by prospective customers.  Installation requirements will
be minimal (web access) and designed to facilitate quick IT/compliance review.
*See Glossary for definitions.
b.  Intelligent Trading Algorithms
The Platform Operator will provide customers with an innovative suite of algorithmic execution
models.  Pre-programmed rules define trade parameters including timing, price, quantity, volatility,
rate of change, etc.  Algorithmic execution enables traders to execute efficiently and identify trading
opportunities.  A large segment of the institutional market relies on algorithmic execution as part of
their overall trading execution strategy.
Benefits of algorithmic trading:
•  Trades are executed at the best possible prices automatically
•  Automated trade order placement ensures accuracy and helps execute desired levels
•  Trades are timed accurately and instantly, to avoid significant price changes
•  Reduced transaction costs
•  Simultaneous automated checks on multiple market conditions reduces risk of errors
•  Reduces/eliminates trader emotional and psychological factors
•  Empirical back-tested algorithms provide confidence in suitability
The most common algorithmic trading strategies follow trends in moving averages, channel
breakouts, price level movements and related technical indicators. These are the easiest and
pg. 18
This document is proprietary and confidential.  No part of this document may be disclosed in any manner to a third party without the prior
written consent of Edgewater Digital Technologies Inc.




simplest strategies to implement through algorithmic trading because these strategies do not involve
making any predictions or price forecasts. Trades are initiated based on the occurrence of desirable
trends, which are easy and straightforward to implement through algorithms without getting into the
complexity of predictive analysis.
c.  Advanced Analytics and Charts
Pre-trade, mid-trade and post-trade analysis facilitates benchmarks for best execution to meet
institutional fiduciary responsibility and to support trading decisions and compliance reporting.
Basic and advanced time series charting capabilities will be available based on customer demand.
For example, some of the popular charting analytics include line/bar, candlestick, Ichimoku Cloud,
volatility, momentum indicators and oscillators, Bollinger bands, etc.
Transaction cost analysis (TCA) is the study of trade prices to determine whether the trades were
arranged at favorable prices.  TCA is essentially a rating of the spread between two possible prices
and the market impact caused by the execution.  Results from these analyses are often used to fine
tune trading processes to make them more effective.
The main challenge of TCA is to determine whether a trade price is high or low given market
conditions at the time the order was processed.   For this purpose, trade prices are commonly
compared to benchmark prices such as the volume-weighted average trade price of the day (VWAP
analysis) or the midpoint  of the bid/ ask spread at the time the order was first created
(implementation shortfall analysis).
Pre-trade Analytics (PTA) - Pre-trade Analytics is the process of taking known trade parameters of
a planned execution and determining the best or most efficient execution strategy.  The goal is to
pg. 19
This document is proprietary and confidential.  No part of this document may be disclosed in any manner to a third party without the prior
written consent of Edgewater Digital Technologies Inc.




minimize the cost of transacting for a given level of acceptable risk. The PTA tool helps traders
determine expected market impact (i.e. slippage) of a transaction based upon the strategy or
method of execution. PTA is an important risk management tool that can help plan trades.
Post-trade analytics (TCA) - Post trade analysis tool offers transparency regarding execution
performance and assess the quality of trader’s execution and decision making.
d.  Position Monitoring and Real-Time P&L
The Platform Operator will provide a blotter system that allows traders to monitor credit and manage
orders, view trade details and positions with a real-time, consolidated P&L.  CPT will connect to the
customer’s back office via STP (straight through processing) for automatic, electronic uploading of
all trade details to the firm’s systems.   Vision Exchange Gateway connections will ensure that
customer specific exchange limits are in synch with CPT at all times.
e.  Mobile Access
Institutional customers are increasingly requesting mobile access to trading platforms, so their
traders can monitor and control open positions and execute trades as market conditions change
throughout the day, regardless of where the trader is at any given moment.   The mobile app will
provide customized alerts to help the trader to remain aware of trade impacting market movements.
The mobile version of CPT will be available on various hardware options of the Apple and Android
platforms.
Credit and Post-Trade Solutions
The Platform Operator plans to stay on the forefront of understanding the various options clients
have for managing exchange credit, post-trade settlement and custody. The Platform Operator
anticipates significant innovation and multiple solutions will evolve over time for credit management,
settlement and custody in the digital asset market.  We also anticipate that different customers will
prefer different solutions. Our goal is to help educate and connect our clients to suitable solutions
and integrate Vision and CPT as required.
Credit, settlement and custody solutions will develop as the digital asset market develops and the
Platform Operator intends to partner with other firms as these important services evolve.
PHASE 2 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT:
Following are additional products that the Platform Operator will introduce after launching its Vision
System and Crypto Prime Trader for institutional investors.
pg. 20

written consent of Edgewater Digital Technologies Inc.




Crypto Prime Trader White-Label Solutions
The Platform Operator will provide a generic, custom branded version of the CPT trading system
for institutional customers (banks, brokers) to provide to their customers.   Firms frequently make
“buy versus build” decisions when targeting customers with a technology solution.  Speed to market
is improved and development risk is reduced dramatically by outsourcing technology to an existing
provider. The Platform Operator will make available a license to firms wishing to “buy” a solution.
As part of the white-label solution, the Platform Operator envisions developing an associated simple
(light) version of CPT for less sophisticated end customers.
Crypto Prime Trader Data
Digital asset market data is currently disseminated by many parties in unrelated formats. The
Platform Operator will consolidate market and order data and normalize it to provide a ‘consolidated
tape’ of digital asset market rates. A market data product will be sold to market participants and
media, including high frequency trading firms, hedge funds, CTAs, banks and asset managers
among others. Access to CPT market data can become the market standard and will be a valuable
revenue generating product.

written consent of Edgewater Digital Technologies Inc.




REVENUE GENERATION MODEL
The Company expects to generate operating revenue in the future from fees charged for the
provision of services in the CPT ecosystem.
Transaction Charges
The Platform Operator will charge transaction fees based on notional trading volume.  The per US$
million fee depends on crypto pair, depth of liquidity, market conditions, customer requirements such
as size and complexity of the order and the execution venue(s), including whether the transaction
occurred on the Vision CLOB.  Volume discounts will be available, as volume increases the basis
point fee per million will decrease.
Value added services including Custody, Intelligent Algorithms and Advanced Analytics will be
available on a subscription basis (basis points per US$ million).
The Platform Operator plans to charge a monthly minimum volume transaction fee per location.
Installation/Setup
CPT installation and setup includes establishing the necessary exchange relationships and pre and
post-trade solution integration, according to individual customer requirements. The Platform
Operator will configure CPT with value added services including Custody, Advanced Intelligent
Trading Algorithms and Advanced Analytics and provide any training required.   Additional set-up
options:
Dedicated data circuits (versus internet) available.
Co-located customer trading engine (Vision POP) - secure and private with the fastest access
available is available.
Crypto Prime Trader Data
Data will be available via a data license fee.   Fees will vary based on usage (single office, global
license, redistribution to firm’s customers, media, etc.).
Crypto Prime Trader White Label
The Platform Operator will white-label CPT to firms that wish to provide a custom branded version
of the platform to their customers.  The white-label version will be provided as a software license
based on the number of users, functionality included (for example, Algorithms, Analytics, etc.) and
volume.

SECURITY TOKEN OFFERING
The Company is offering Preferred Equity to accredited investors with an ERC20 security token
offering.
The capital raised will accelerate development of the Company’s digital asset trading system,
Crypto Prime Trader, and support a successful product launch.  As in the fiat trading market, there
are many trading platforms that will co-exist in the crypto market. We believe the leading crypto
platforms will be established in the next 12-18 months and Edgewater has the currency trading
expertise, technology and relationships to establish itself as one of the leading platforms.
To achieve this, Edgewater Digital Technologies is issuing Preferred Stock which the Company
intends to be in the form of digital Security Tokens or Uncertificated Shares.  The Security Tokens
or Shares will provide purchasers with equity ownership and dividends.
Security Tokens provide many benefits for Purchasers and the Company: including: lower cost
issuance as compared to traditional capital markets, automated compliance thru programmable
“smart contracts”, improved transparency and accuracy of ownership records, efficient investor
management (streamlined payment of dividends, communications, etc.), increased accessibility
thru fractional ownership, global reach, and 24/7/365 availability via secondary markets enhance
price discovery and improve liquidity.
It is intended that the Security Tokens will be listed for trading on multiple security token platforms
(available for trading following the required lock-up period).
A strict limit of 250 million Security Tokens will be created, creating an upper cap on the total
number of tokens.
The Company will accept USD, ETH and BTC.
The Securities are being offered to non-U.S. persons within the meaning of Regulation S and to
U.S. persons that are accredited investors in compliance with U.S. securities laws under
Regulation D 506(c).
A detailed financial forecast is available upon request.

Appendix A | Glossary
Algorithmic Trading: The process of using computer programs to follow a defined set of
instructions for executing a trade at a speed and frequency that is impossible for a human trader.
API (Application Programming Interface): A clearly defined protocol for communication
between different exchanges and systems.
Central Limit Order Book (CLOB): A centralized database of orders placed by market
participants. A central limit order book will match different orders to reduce execution cost by
crossing the bid/ask spread. The CLOB offers the ability to see market depth, in which customers
can view the various prices and size available at each level, providing fully transparent, real-time,
anonymous and low cost in execution.
Consolidated Order Book: The aggregation of orders and prices from multiple market
exchanges in a single consolidated view.
ESP pricing: Executable Streaming Price. Real-time pricing of a financial product whose rate is
continuously streaming and can be executed upon immediately.
Fill Ratio: The ratio between the cumulative amount of trades executed versus trades attempted.
This is calculated on either the number of orders executed/attempted, or the volume of orders
executed/attempted.
FIX Protocol: Short for the Financial Information exchange protocol, FIX protocol is a technical
specification for electronic communication of trade-related messages. FIX protocol acts as a
standardized format of messaging used for real-time exchange of information related to security
transactions and the financial market.
FOK Order Type: “Fill or Kill” order types specify that the order is executed immediately. The
order is either filled in its entirety, or otherwise cancelled completely.
GUI: Graphical User Interface - a user interface that enables users to interact with a computer
through use of graphical elements, such as windows, icons, buttons and point devices.
IOC Order Type: Immediate or Cancel order types specify that the order is executed immediately.
If the entire order quantity becomes unavailable during execution, a partial fulfillment of the order
is possible.

Keystroke Efficiency: A measurement of the efficiency of a software program, defined as the
number of keystrokes required to perform a specific function. More efficiency in the software
program leads to a lower the likelihood of human error or confusion occurs.
Limit Order Type: Limit order types will attempt to buy or sell a financial product at no more or
less than a specified price and are used when a trader wishes to control the price of the
execution, rather than the certainty of the quantity of the execution.
MIS: Management information system or management information systems refers to the
complementary networks of hardware and software cooperating to collect, process, store, and
disseminate information in order to support the managerial role of leveraging information
technology to increase and monitor market performance and client experience.
RFQ/RFS pricing: Request for Quote or Request for Stream. In comparison to ESP pricing, the
pricing of a financial product is not continuously streaming. For RFQ/RFS pricing, a trader
specifies the product, size and tenor which they are looking to execute, and submit the request.
Pricing is then returned for the exact specifications of the execution.
Slippage: The allowable deviation from the price where a trade is submitted which a trader will
accept the execution. This allows for a higher certainty of the quantity of the execution attempted.
Smart Order Router (SOR): An automated process of executing large orders via a Volume
Weighted Average Price (VWAP), aimed at taking the best available opportunity by following
defined rules, configurations and algorithms. The rules and algorithms within the smart order
router analyze all connection venues for a variety of performance factors including, but not limited
to, price, fill ratio, market impact, latency and execution/venue cost.
STP (Straight-Through Processing): The electronic and automatic transfer of a financial
transaction for the purpose of settlement and reporting. STP reduces the time required to process
a transaction and increases the accuracy of settlement instructions.
Time-In-Force: The time period for which an order is considered live/active.
Trading Platform: Software though which investors and traders can open, close and manage
market positions through a financial intermediary.

APPENDIX B | RISK FACTORS
The further development and acceptance of blockchain networks, which are part of a new and
rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The
slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of blockchain networks and blockchain
assets would have a material adverse effect on successful development.
The growth of the blockchain industry, in general, as well as the blockchain networks on which the
Company will rely upon in its business operations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. A
decline in the popularity or acceptance of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum would
adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, the development, launch and/or operations
of the Company. Factors that affect the development of the cryptocurrency industry and
blockchain networks, include, but are not limited to:
•  worldwide growth in the adoption and use of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain
technologies;
•  government and quasi-government regulation of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain
assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to, and operation of
blockchain networks or similar systems;
•  the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the Bitcoin or
Ethereum networks;
•  changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;
•  the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and
services; and
•  general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies.
Blockchain networks are based on software protocols that govern peer-to-peer interactions
between computers connected to these networks. The suitability of the networks for the
Company’s business, depends upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
•  the effectiveness of the informal groups of (often uncompensated) developers contributing
to the protocols that underlie the networks;
•  the effectiveness of the network validators (sometimes called “miners”) and the network’s
consensus mechanisms to effectively secure the networks against confirmation of invalid
transactions;
•  disputes among the developers or validators of the networks;
pg. 34
This document is proprietary and confidential.  No part of this document may be disclosed in any manner to a third party without the prior
written consent of Edgewater Digital Technologies Inc.




•  changes in the consensus or validation schemes that underlie the networks, including,
without limitation, shifts between so-called “proof of work” and “proof of stake”
schemes;
•  the failure of cybersecurity controls or security breaches of the networks;
•  the existence of other competing and operational versions of the networks, including,
without limitation, so-called “forked” networks;
•  the existence of undiscovered technical flaws in the networks;
•  the development of new or existing hardware, software tools, or mechanisms that could
negatively impact the functionality of the systems;
•  the price of blockchain assets associated with the networks;
•  intellectual property rights-based claims or other claims against the networks’
participants; and
•  the maturity of the computer software programming languages used in connection with the
networks.
Unfavorable developments or characteristics of any of the above circumstances could adversely
affect the Company’s business, the development, launch and/or operations of the Company.
The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, tokens, and token
offerings is uncertain. Developments in regulations in the United States or in other jurisdictions
may alter the nature of the Company’s business or restrict the use of blockchain assets or the
operation of a blockchain network upon which the Company and its business will rely in a manner
that adversely affects the Company’s business, the development and/or operation of the
Company.
As blockchain networks and blockchain assets have grown in popularity and in market size,
federal and state agencies have begun to take an interest in, and, in some cases, regulate their
use and operation. In the case of virtual currencies, US state regulators like the New York
Department of Financial Services, have created new regulatory frameworks. Other states, such as
Texas, have published guidance as to how their existing regulatory frameworks apply to virtual
currencies. Other states have amended their state’s statutes to apply existing licensing regimes to
virtual currencies. Treatment of virtual currencies continues to evolve under US federal law as
well. Both the US Department of the Treasury and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission
(the “CFTC”), for example, have published guidance on the treatment of virtual currencies like
Bitcoin. Further, the IRS released guidance on virtual currencies classifying Bitcoin and Ether as
property for the purposes of US federal income taxes. Both US federal and state agencies have
instituted enforcement actions against those violating their interpretation of existing laws.
pg. 35

written consent of Edgewater Digital Technologies Inc.




The regulation of non-currency use of blockchain assets is of particular relevance to the
Company’s business and the software upon which it will rely. Neither the SEC nor the CFTC has
formally asserted regulatory authority over any particular blockchain network. The CFTC has
publicly taken the position that certain blockchain assets are commodities, but the SEC has not
officially taken the position all blockchain assets are securities; rather, it is a facts and
circumstances test. To the extent that a US government or quasi-governmental agency exerts
regulatory authority over a blockchain network, including one upon which the Company’s business
relies, or a blockchain asset, the Company’s business and the functionality of the Company may
be adversely affected.
On July 25, 2017, the SEC issued an investigative report cautioning market participants that offers
and sales of digital assets by “virtual” organizations are subject to the requirements of the US
federal securities laws. The report, entitled “Report of Investigation Pursuant to Section 21(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO” (the “DAO Report”), found that tokens offered and
sold by a “virtual” organization known as “The DAO” were securities and were therefore subject to
the US federal securities laws. The DAO Report confirmed that issuers of distributed ledger or
blockchain technology-based securities must register offers and sales of such securities unless a
valid exemption applies.
Certain non-US regulators have also released statements or issued some form of guidance
regarding their position on “initial coin offerings” and token sales. The Company’s business, the
development, launch and/or operations of the Company could be adversely affected by
regulations that restrict the use or trading of cryptocurrencies or digital assets and as a result, and
as a consequence, the value of The Shares may diminish to zero.
If regulatory changes or interpretations require the regulation of digital currencies under the United
States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and the United States Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) by the SEC, we may be
required to register and comply with such regulations. To the extent that we decide to continue
operations, the required registrations and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary,
non-recurring expenses to us. We may also decide to cease certain operations. Any disruption of
our operations in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that is
disadvantageous to purchasers of The Shares.
Current and future legislation and rulemaking of the SEC, CIMA and other regulatory
developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner
in which cryptocurrencies are treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, digital
currencies may not be excluded from the definition of “security” by SEC or CIMA rulemaking or
interpretation. As of the date of this whitepaper, we are not aware of any rules or interpretations
pg. 36
This document is proprietary and confidential.  No part of this document may be disclosed in any manner to a third party without the prior
written consent of Edgewater Digital Technologies Inc.




that have been proposed to regulate cryptocurrencies as securities in the United States. We
cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of
cryptocurrencies under applicable law. Such additional registrations may result in extraordinary,
non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely impacting the Security Tokens. If we
determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may
seek to cease certain of our operations. Any such action may adversely affect the Company and
CPT.
To the extent that cryptocurrencies are deemed by the SEC to fall within the definition of a
security, we may be required to register and comply with additional regulation under the
Investment Company Act, including additional periodic reporting and disclosure standards and
requirements and the registration of our Company as an investment company. Additionally, one or
more states may conclude cryptocurrencies are a security under state securities laws which would
require registration under state laws including merit review laws which would adversely impact us
since we would likely not comply. Such additional registrations may result in extraordinary, non-
recurring expenses of our Company, thereby materially and adversely impacting the Security
Tokens. If we determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration
requirements, we may seek to cease all or certain parts of our operations. Any such action may
adversely affect an investment in us.
Developments in foreign regulations and laws may alter the nature of the Company’s business or
restrict the operation of a blockchain network upon which the Company relies, including the use of
blockchain assets, in a manner that adversely affects our business.
Blockchain networks currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in not only the United
States, but also in many foreign jurisdictions, which have issued guidelines or regulatory
communications regarding cryptocurrencies, digital assets and “initial coin offerings” and are still
working on ways to regulate this industry. Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the future, adopt
laws, regulations, or directives that affect the Ethereum network and its users, particularly Ether
exchanges and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions’ regulatory scope. Such laws,
regulations, or directives may conflict with those of the United States, or may directly and
negatively impact the Company’s business, the development, launch and/or operations of the
Company. The effect of any future regulatory change is impossible to predict, but such change
could be substantial and adverse to the Company’s business, the development, launch and/or
operations of the Company and the development of the Company. Developments in US
commercial and corporate laws may alter the nature of the Company’s business or the
development or operation of the software in a manner that adversely affects the Company’s
business.
pg. 37

written consent of Edgewater Digital Technologies Inc.




The Company may not successfully develop, market and launch CPT or a Token Trading System.
The Company views the development of CPT as a key commercial milestone. The development
of CPT and a Token Trading System has not yet commenced, and CPT may never be developed.
In addition, the development of CPT would require significant capital funding, expertise of the
Company’s management and time and effort in order to be successful. The Company may have to
make changes to the specifications of CPT for any number of reasons or the Company may be
unable to develop CPT in a way that realizes those specifications or any form of a functioning
network. It is possible that CPT may not ever be released and there may never be an operational
system or launch of CPT may never occur. CPT, if successfully developed and maintained, may
not meet expectations of Potential Purchasers at the time of purchase. Furthermore, despite good
faith efforts to develop and complete the launch of CPT and subsequently to maintain CPT, it is
still possible that CPT will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or
maintained, which may negatively impact CPT and The Shares.
The Company may, but is not obligated to, use the proceeds of its sale of The Shares to make
significant investments to develop and launch a viable Token Trading System and subsequently to
build a fulsome network upon which users can realize utility and value. The Company may not
have or may not be able to obtain the technical skills and expertise needed to successfully
develop CPT and progress it to a successful launch. While the Company has sought to retain and
continue to competitively recruit experts, there, may, from time to time, be a general scarcity of
management, technical, scientific, research and marketing personnel with appropriate training to
develop and maintain CPT. In addition, there are significant legal and regulatory considerations
that will need to be addressed in order to develop and maintain CPT and addressing such
considerations will require significant time and resources. If the Company is not successful in its
efforts to develop CPT that is compliant with all regulatory and legal requirements and to
demonstrate to users the utility and value of CPT, there may not be sufficient demand for The
Shares for the Company to proceed with the launch of CPT. As a result, or if the launch does not
occur, purchasers of The Shares may lose all of their investment.
Blockchain industry is highly competitive and should intensify in the future.
There are many platforms that enable the use of blockchain technologies in the payment
ecosystem. Additional competitors are likely to enter the industry in the future. It is possible that
alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same or similar open source code and
protocol underlying CPT and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the services
offered by or within CPT. CPT may compete with these alternatives, which could negatively impact
CPT and Security Tokens.

Risks associated with unauthorized access.
Third parties that gain access to a user’s login credentials or private keys may be able to transfer
the user’s value. To minimize this risk, the users should guard against unauthorized access to
their electronic devices. Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the
blockchain technology or the availability of our anticipated blockchain technology solutions in any
number of ways, including without limitation denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing,
smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks.
Risk of security weaknesses in the core infrastructure and software.
Some parts of the core software may be based on open-source software. There is a risk that the
development team, or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce
weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructure elements of our anticipated blockchain technology
solutions interfering with the use of or causing the loss to the Company.
Risk of weaknesses or exploitable breakthroughs in the field of cryptography.
Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum
computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and network, which could result in theft or loss.
Risk of hard-fork: CPT will need to go through substantial development works as part of which it
may become the subject of significant conceptual, technical and commercial changes before
release.
There is no existing trading market for Security Tokens and an active trading market may not
develop. Security Tokens will not be listed on any exchange and secondary trading may be
limited.
Security Tokens are a new issue of digital tokens for which there is no established public market.
The Company may not enable or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or any such external
valuation of Security Tokens. This may restrict the contemplated avenues for using Security
Tokens to the token functionality described in in this whitepaper and could therefore create
illiquidity risk with respect to any Security Tokens you own. Even if secondary trading of Security
Tokens is facilitated by third-party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject
to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation.
Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange value to Security
pg. 39
This document is proprietary and confidential.  No part of this document may be disclosed in any manner to a third party without the prior
written consent of Edgewater Digital Technologies Inc.




Tokens (e.g. as denominated in a crypto or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile
and diminish to zero.
The liquidity of any market for the Security Tokens will depend on many factors, including:
•  the number of holders of Security Tokens;
•  the market for similar digital tokens;
•  the interest of potential users of the Platform in the Platform;
•  the Company’s performance and financial condition;
•  the Company’s successful development of the Platform;
•  developments in the Company’s industry; and
•  regulatory developments in the digital token or cryptocurrency industries.
The digital token market is a new and rapidly developing market which may be subject to
substantial and unpredictable disruptions that cause significant volatility in the prices of digital
tokens. We cannot assure you that the market, if any, for Security Tokens will be free from such
disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect your ability to sell your Security
Tokens. Therefore, we cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your Security Tokens at a
particular time or that the price you receive when you sell will be favorable.
Only certain persons and entities are able to acquire The Shares.
Only limited categories of persons and entities may purchase The Shares. The Company expects
that these limitations will limit liquidity in Security Tokens, and the limitations may have a material
adverse effect on the development of any trading market in the Security Tokens. Out of an
abundance of caution, the Company is restricting the issuance and transfer of Security Tokens as
if Security Tokens were securities under the Securities Act. The Shares have not been registered
under the Securities Act or any United States state securities laws or under the securities laws of
any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the
account or benefit of, United States persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable U.S.
state securities laws. In addition, in offshore transactions The Shares may be purchased only by
non-U.S. Persons in accordance with applicable restrictions under the securities laws of the
jurisdictions in which they are sold. Generally, foreign securities laws restrict the categories of
persons permitted to purchase securities to specified classes of sophisticated investors. No action
has been taken in any jurisdiction to permit a public offering of The Shares.

written consent of Edgewater Digital Technologies Inc.




Consequently, it is expected that there will only be a limited number of Security Token holders, a
purchaser of The Shares and an owner of beneficial interests in those Security Tokens must be
able to bear the economic risk of their investment in The Shares for an indefinite period of time.
For a discussion of certain restrictions on resale and transfer, see Appendix C.
The wallet or wallet service provider used to receive Security Tokens must to conform to the
ERC20 token standard in order to be technically compatible with Security Tokens.
The failure to ensure such conformity may have the result that Potential Purchaser will not gain
access to his Security Tokens.
You may not have the skills necessary to secure, trade or use the Security Tokens.
Participating in any offering of digital tokens requires technical skill beyond that of many investors
in digital tokens. Securing, trading or using digital tokens requires working knowledge of
blockchain technology, blockchain assets and their attendant systems and processes. Similar
knowledge of blockchain asset exchanges and other industry participants may be required to
make obtain the full benefit of Security Tokens.
Security Tokens may not be insurable.
Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, Security Tokens are
uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of
loss, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse to you.
The tax characterization of Security Tokens, the Company and the offering of Security Tokens is
uncertain.
You must seek your own tax advice in connection with acquisition, storage, transfer and use of
Security Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including, without
limitation, withholding taxes, transfer taxes, value added taxes, income taxes and similar taxes,
levies, duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements. The tax characterization of
Security Tokens also affects the Company’s tax liability in connection with this offering. There are
also significant uncertainties about the taxation of the operations of the Company.
We may require additional capital to fully utilize our business plan on a going forward basis as the
Company develops and deploys its anticipated blockchain technology solutions and related
ecosystem.
pg. 41
This document is proprietary and confidential.  No part of this document may be disclosed in any manner to a third party without the prior
written consent of Edgewater Digital Technologies Inc.




While the Company expects that funding of the project will be from the proceeds of this offering,
the Company might require additional capital to fully utilize its business plan on a go forward basis
as the Company develops and deploys the ecosystem, cost of development of the ecosystem,
value-added solutions as well as deployment and distribution costs. There is no assurance that
the Company will be able to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms when needed.
The use of new and untested technologies, including blockchain technology, may result in risks
that we may not be able to currently anticipate.
Blockchain technology is a relatively new and untested technology. In addition to the risks set forth
here, there are risks with the use of this technology that the Company cannot anticipate. Risks
may further materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations from the risks set forth here.
Security Tokens do not grant governance rights with respect to the Company.
Because Security Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to CPT or the
Company, all decisions involving Company (including to sell or liquidate Company) will be made
by the Company and its board of directors, and all decisions involving CPT including, but not
limited to, decisions to discontinue CPT, to create and issue more Security Tokens, will be made
by the Company. These decisions could adversely affect CPT and/or Security Tokens you hold.
The Company is a new entity with no operating history.
The Company was incorporated in January 2019 and has not commenced operations.

APPENDIX C | NOTICE TO PURCHASERS
No offering of The Shares has been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any
jurisdiction anywhere in the world. The Shares are being offered and sold only in jurisdictions
where such registration or qualification is not required, including pursuant to applicable
exemptions that generally limit the purchasers who are eligible to purchase The Shares and that
restrict their resale. The Shares may not be offered, sold, assigned, transferred, pledged,
encumbered or otherwise disposed of except as permitted under applicable securities laws and
the restrictions imposed on The Shares hereunder.
Until a trading platform that is capable of trading the Tokens and other tokens or coins that are
determined to be securities for purposes of U.S. securities laws is available (the “Token Trading
System”), or the Company in the future designates a digital token exchange pursuant to which
holders of Security Tokens may transfer or resell their Security Tokens (such an exchange,
together with the Token Trading System, a “Designated Exchange”), the Tokens will not be
transferrable on any trading platform even if there are no legal restrictions on transfer. There can
be no assurance that any Designated Exchange will be chosen or created or that all Token
holders will have access to a Designated Exchange. The Token Trading System is not expected to
have been developed by on the date that the Security Tokens are initially issued.
In addition, Token holders will not be able to transfer their Tokens until the Company designates or
creates a Designated Exchange. Peer-to-peer trading will not be permitted unless and until Token
holders are notified otherwise by the Company and informed of the requirements to do so.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any Designated Exchange will be chosen or created
or that all Token holders will have access to a Designated Exchange.
Notice to Residents of the United States
The Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act or any securities laws of any state
and, unless so registered, The Shares may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities
Act and such other securities laws. The Shares  are being initially offered and sold only (1) to
“accredited investors” (as defined under Regulation D) in compliance with Regulation D, in each
case, in a private transaction in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act provided by Regulation D under the Securities Act, and (2) outside the United
States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance upon Regulation S under the
Securities Act. The Shares are being offered outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in
offshore transactions in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act.

As used herein, the terms “United States,” “U.S. person” and “offshore transactions” have the
meanings given to them in Regulation S under the Securities Act.
Each purchaser of The Shares will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented and warranted
to, and agreed with, the Company as follows:
(1)                                                                                                                                          It understands and acknowledges that (i) the issuance of The Shares has not been and
will not be registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law, (ii)
The Shares are being offered for sale in transactions not requiring registration under
the Securities Act or any other applicable U.S. state securities law, (iii) The Shares will
be issued in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other
applicable U.S. state securities law, and (iv)  The Shares may not be offered, sold or
otherwise transferred or disposed of, except in compliance with the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities law, or pursuant
to an exemption therefrom and, in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth
in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.
(2)                                                                                                                                          It acknowledges that this whitepaper relates to an offering that is exempt from

all times within its or their control and, in each case, in compliance with applicable

registration requirements of the Securities Act.
