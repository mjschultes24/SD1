Abstract: Currently, the cryptoverse lacks a robust ecosystem that is sustainable in the
long-term. Despite recent technical advancements, PoS and PoW consensus algorithms
have proved to only allow those to get richer proportionally to how rich they already
were. To tackle these challenges, we propose a platform centered around dApps with a
dual coin system using an artificial intelligence supported consensus algorithm, AI-
DPoC (Artificial Intelligence-supported Delegated Proof of Contribution). EcoVerse™
is the first ever designed self-sustainable cryptocurrency platform.

achieve the goal of hundreds of thousands TPS
in real world application with TFT at less than
2 seconds, which we consider the highest limit
for cryptocurrency adoption in daily activities.
Ecoverse™ supports a two-coin system that
answers  both  the  need  for  privacy  and
KYC/AML regulation and allows for a stable
currency, optimal for the needs of e-commerce,
and a utility coin for interchain connectivity
and growing in value.
EcoVerse™  is  simply  better  than  many
platforms in the following areas
✓                                                  Technology:  it  provides  an  array  of
solutions,  including  patent-pending  AI-
DPoC for consensus and the fastest TFT.
✓                                                  Economics:  it  is  designed  to  be  self-
sustainable  unlike  almost  all  the  other
cryptocurrency mechanisms.
✓                                                  Philosophy:   Based   on   a   different
perspective   on   humans   than   other
platforms,  it  is  designed  to  build  an
ecosystem based on Ubuntu economy.
✓                                                  Socio-Psychology: To increase longevity
and guarantee the platform’s sustainability,
Incentive  Compatible  Mechanisms  are
designed  by  adopting  Spiral  Dynamics
Value Meme and Integral Theory.
✓                                                  Business  Orientation:  EcoVerse™  is
designed  to  be  a  dApp-centered  shell
structure. The dApps will collaborate and
share the businesses and customers so that
they may all grow together.
