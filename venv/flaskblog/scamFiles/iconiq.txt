Abstract
This  Whitepaper  describes  Iconiq  Holding  and  its  digital  asset  management  ecosystem,  its
subsidiaries, Iconiq Lab and Iconiq Funds, and the ICNQ token.
Iconiq Holding is building the premier digital asset management ecosystem, launching trusted
financial vehicles and business opportunities for investors in the blockchain market, driven by the
ICNQ token.
To power the ecosystem, Iconiq Holding has created the ICNQ token, an ERC20 compliant utility
token. ICNQ provides privileged membership rights to its holders and acts as a voucher for
services across the ecosystem. Holders of the token gain exclusive access to Iconiq Lab, enjoying
exposure to some of the most promising ventures graduating the accelerator. Iconiq Funds offers
holders access to premium share classes in all its investment vehicles, such as PIFs, ETNs and ETFs.
All funds pay management fees in the ICNQ token. Additionally, Iconiq Funds’ asset management
platform allows portfolio managers to seamlessly manage their digital asset investment vehicles.
In April 2018, a finite amount of 20M ICNQ tokens were minted. Of these tokens, 4.1M have been
sold in presales throughout  2018, raising  €2.5M. The Iconiq Holding team has purchased an
additional 3M with a 12-month time-lock. A remainder of 2.9M tokens have been burned and
10M are currently available for sale for a targeted hard-cap raise of €10M. 500k of the available
ICNQ tokens will be available for purchase in a public sale on GBX beginning Oct. 29th, 2018.

Executive Summary
Digital asset market capitalization reached record highs in 2018 and ICOs offer alternative funding
mechanisms with improved liquidity for early-stage investors. With trustless custodial sources and
decentralized wealth generation, allowing for global financial inclusion, it’s easy to see why digital
assets are the fastest growing asset class today.
However,  what is  lacking in the digital asset  space  are standard  investor  quality assurances
typically  afforded  to  institutional  and  retail  participants  of  the  traditional  financial  markets.
Regulated, trusted investment vehicles, such as ETFs and ETNs, are almost non-existent and many
ICOs have been revealed as scams or do not perform long-term due to management teams being
held to a lower level of accountability than traditional startups.
To bring professional digital asset management to the space, Iconiq Holding launched Iconiq Lab
in early 2017 as the world’s first decentralized VC club, and Iconiq Funds in 2018, an asset manager
issuing  a  series  of  digital  asset  index  funds  capturing  the  top  cryptocurrencies  by  market
capitalization as well as an Asset Manager as a Service (“AMaaS”) platform. The entire Iconiq
Holding digital asset management ecosystem is powered by the ICNQ token.
Iconiq Lab offers financing and professional company building to blockchain startups and quality
investment opportunities to investors through its decentralized VC club and ICO accelerator.
Through its unique platform, Iconiq Funds offers professional digital asset management with
regulated, structured vehicles. By integrating premium market data, trade execution, custody,
auditing and compliance tools, investors will gain diversified exposure to the highest growing
asset class in the market today through traditional investment structures such as ETFs and ETNs.
The ICNQ token powers the Iconiq Holding ecosystem through privileged rights offered to holders
and is redeemable as a voucher instrument for in-ecosystem services. ICNQ holders receive access
to  exclusive  Iconiq  Lab  graduate  presales  and  Iconiq  Funds  share  classes  with  reduced
management fees. As a voucher, ICNQ is used by all funds to pay management fees. 10% of all
redeemed voucher tokens are burned on a quarterly basis, and ecosystem behavior is incentivized
through a loyalty rewards program distributing ICNQ tokens to longtime club members.

1. The ICNQ Ecosystem
1.1. The Ecosystem
The ICNQ Token
The ICNQ Token powers the Iconiq Holding ecosystem, creating a harmonic solution to digital
asset management. Holders of the token gain exclusive membership to the ICO investment club
and fund share classes, available through Iconiq Lab and Iconiq Funds. Additionally, the token is
redeemable as a voucher by holders for discounts on ecosystem services.
The Iconiq Holding ecosystem consists of Iconiq Lab, Iconiq Funds, and the Iconiq Media unit
which publishes the weekly Unbloqed podcast. Each of the Iconiq Holding business units has their
own unique use case of the ICNQ token, whether as a membership instrument or voucher.

1.2. Ecosystem Value Drivers
Token-economics Best Practices
Through  extensive  market  research  and  industry  experience  as  a  renowned  ICO  accelerator
program,  Iconiq  Holding  has  developed  a  best-practice  framework  for  compliant  utility
tokenization. A high-quality utility token instrument should;
•   Decrease token velocity through incentivization to hold the token, limiting trading supply
•   Increase demand through ecosystem service growth and token use cases
•   Balance circulating supply through token burning and
•   Reward user behavior in-ecosystem through loyalty rewards programs
This framework has been implemented into the upgraded ICNQ token design.
Decreasing Token Velocity
Purchasers of the ICNQ token are incentivized to hold it through ICNQ’s club membership features
and loyalty rewards program. There are two tiers of ICNQ club memberships;
•   ICNQ Membership: holders of at least 1 or more ICNQ tokens who have exclusive access
to the public presales, with the highest bonuses and discounts, of all Iconiq Lab accelerator
program graduates. Members participate in the graduate’s presales based on their pro-
rata holding of the ICNQ token. ICNQ Members also receive access to Iconiq events and
other membership benefits.
•   ICON Membership: holders of €100,000 or more of the ICNQ tokens who are given all ICNQ
Membership  benefits  plus  premium  access  to  Iconiq  Lab’s  accelerator  graduates  to
negotiate the size of the investment they wish to make into the presale. ICON Members
also can subscribe to the ICON share classes of the planned index funds, offering reduced
management fees.
Additionally, the loyalty rewards program incentivizes ecosystem participants to be longtime
members of the ICNQ club through ongoing voucher distributions and other planned rewards.
P a g e

Increasing Token Demand
Iconiq Holding and its business units continuously create and release new products and services
in the ICNQ ecosystem to increase demand for membership benefits and the redeemable voucher.
Iconiq Lab accelerator companies must pay portions of their fee after the completed token sale in
the ICNQ  token. Additionally, all Funds  issued will pay  their  management  fees  to the asset
manager, Iconiq Funds, in the ICNQ token. As the Assets Under Management (“AUM”) for the
funds grows through organic asset appreciation and new fund issuances, so to does the fees the
funds must pay on an annual basis. This gives rise to systematic, institutional demand for the ICNQ
token on a recurring basis.
Balancing Supply and Demand
10% of all ICNQ tokens Iconiq Holding companies receive back as redeemed vouchers will be
burned on a quarterly basis, creating exclusivity for ICNQ club membership through the limitation
of the available token supply.
Loyalty Rewards Programs
Iconiq Holding will reward certain in-ecosystem behavior through a loyalty rewards program to
incentivize users to engage with the ICNQ community positively and constructively. Examples of
planned loyalty rewards, so long as they remain regulatorily compliant by jurisdiction, include;
•   Recurring reward distributions of ICNQ to longtime ICNQ club members
•   Bonuses for reaching the ICON Membership level
•   Asset managers reaching certain levels of AUM on the AMaaS platform
•   Unbloqed podcast listenership and event participation
More potential loyalty rewards are planned based on new ecosystem services and will be released
as the ICNQ ecosystem grows and evolves.

2.4. Roadmap
Global Scaling
Iconiq Lab has already scaled in Europe and to the United States and is expanding its Asian
presence. The team aims to offer up to 2-3 quality ICO opportunities per month with a target of
20-25 per year to drive value to the ICNQ VC investors club.
Corporates and SMEs
Large companies, including fortune 500, publicly-listed companies, are approaching Iconiq Lab to
manage their token sale. As Iconiq Lab onboards such clients, the quality and volume of ICOs
offered to the ICNQ club will grow. With sizes exceeding $100M, Iconiq Lab will offer 2-4 annually.
Security and Financial Instrument Tokenization
The Iconiq Lab team believes in the securitization of traditional financial instruments, such as debts
and equity, on the blockchain. Iconiq Lab is in the process of obtaining the proper licenses to issue
and sell such instruments for our portfolio companies to the ICNQ club and investors in 2019.

3. Iconiq Funds
3.1. Company Description
Overview
Iconiq  Funds  offers  investors  the  opportunity  to  diversify  their  cryptocurrency  investments
through a series of professionally managed digital asset index funds, such as PIFs, ETFs and ETNs.
Launched in 2018, Iconiq Funds’ digital asset management platform of regulated financial vehicles
integrates premium market data, trade execution, custody, audit, and compliance tools , creating
a holistic solution for digital asset management for retail and institutional investors.
3.2. Company Traction
Professional Investment Fund (PIF)
The  first  fund to launch will  be a Maltese Professional Investment  Fund  (“PIF”), planned for
November 2018. A PIF is an open-ended fund, permitted to have up to €100 million in AUM and
may accept subscriptions from professional investors only. The PIF fund application is currently
under review by the Malta Financial Services Authority, the Maltese regulator.
3.3. BITA Partnership
Overview
Iconiq  Funds  has  engaged  BITA,  the  premier  digital  index
company, to be the index provider for its digital asset index
funds.  BITA’s  enterprise-grade  index  engines  apply  strict
quantitative and qualitative filters to ensure digital asset price
feeds faithfully reflect current market conditions, providing a
proper price benchmark for all digital assets more accurate
than any current solution. More information can be found at
https://www.bitadata.com/.

3.4. Asset Management as a Service
Description
Leveraging  the  ecosystem  created  for  Iconiq  Funds’  passively-managed  investment  vehicles,
Iconiq Funds will license the platform out to external, active digital asset managers, lowering the
barriers to entry for portfolio managers to launch their own digital asset funds. Services within the
AMaaS platform or trusted third-party service providers include;
1.   Investment Vehicle Design and Launch: Initial design of the investment vehicle, development
of the investment strategy and registration with the competent regulatory authority.
2.   Ongoing Product Management: Integration into top fund administrators, liquidity providers,
compliance experts, custodial solutions, banking and audit and taxation professionals.
3.   Distribution and Execution: Cost-efficient and optimized execution of digital asset transactions
across multiple exchanges, brokerage access and additional capital markets support.
4.   Reporting and Investor Relations: Compliant distribution of sophisticated investor marketing
materials and transparent reporting through KPI analysis of investment performance metrics.
The Icon Vault
The AMaaS platform is built around the Icon vault, which provides a safe custodian wallet solution
for multiple digital assets. It implements both a hot and cold storage split-strategy and multiple
signature wallets (multisig) to maximize protection. This combination of blockchain custodian
methods ensures the highest level of protection against theft or human error that might lead to
the loss of some or all the digital assets.
Aggregated Order Book
The AMaaS platform’s aggregated orderbook will provide a streamlined solution for an asset
manager  to  create, amend,  execute and evaluate  the portfolio  based on their  strategy.  The
aggregated orderbook allows the asset manager to view the liquidity in the market as defined by
their investment strategy. To help achieve the lowest cost and optimize investment performance,
P a g e
16




the platform will present the weighted-average price of the assets and a trade breakdown required
to fulfil an order across different providers and crypto trading pairs on various exchanges.
Order Execution Algorithm
As the asset manager initiates the creation of the orderbook and declares the assets required, the
platform retrieves pricing across the various exchanges. Once the data is gathered, the platform
will aggregate the results and present the options with the best costs for buying and selling the
assets.
3.5. Roadmap
ETNs and ETFs
Leveraging the team’s  experience with the German  stock  exchange, Deutsche Börse, and as
auditors of Vanguard, the world’s largest index fund provider, Iconiq Funds plans to launch ETNs
and ETFs in 2019 to enhance value for the ICNQ ecosystem and the investors of the funds.
Digital Financial Instruments
Iconiq Funds believes in the merits of security and financial instrument tokenization. The team
hypothesizes that in the next few years, cryptocurrencies may be supplemented by digital financial
instruments such as fortune-500 companies’ debt and equity issuances. Leveraging the technical
infrastructure of Iconiq Funds’, the platform is uniquely positioned to be not only the premier
digital asset manager, but a top global asset manager as digital assets become the largest asset
class. Iconiq Funds is engaging global regulators to educate them on the merits of digital assets
and develop a framework for compliant digital financial instrument investing.
AMaaS
Iconiq  Funds  aims  to  onboard  multiple  external,  active  asset  managers,  allowing  the  ICNQ
ecosystem to capture the benefits of passively-managed digital asset investments and hedge
fundesque active management. The platform is planned to go live in Q2 2019 and be offered only
to high quality and vetted digital asset managers.

4. The ICNQ Token
4.1. ICNQ Token Ecosystem Uses
Overview
The ICNQ token is the value driver of the Iconiq Holding ecosystem, providing membership access
to high quality investment vehicles and voucher discounts on ecosystem products and services.
Each business unit has its own unique use for the ICNQ token.
Iconiq Holding Uses
•   Voucher Burning: 10% of all redeemed ICNQ voucher tokens Iconiq Holding business units
receive will be burned to the Ethereum genesis wallet on a quarterly basis.
•   Loyalty Program Rewards: To influence ecosystem behavior, Iconiq Holding will distribute
additional redeemable voucher tokens to loyal ICNQ club members. Examples of planned
loyalty rewards, so long as they remain regulatorily compliant by jurisdiction, include;
▪   Recurring reward distributions of ICNQ to longtime ICNQ club members
▪   Bonuses for reaching the ICON Membership level
▪   Asset managers reaching certain levels of AUM on the AMaaS platform
▪   Unbloqed podcast listenership and event participation
•   Reselling: ICNQ tokens redeemed to Iconiq Holding businesses by consumers that are not
burned or redistributed through the loyalty program will be resold into the marketplace in an
ongoing  basis to  maintain a  healthy balance of  supply and demand for  new ecosystem
members.
Iconiq Lab Uses
•   Exclusive Presales and Discounts: ICNQ token holders have access to presales with exclusive
discounts of Iconiq Lab’s accelerator graduates with the ability to participate on a pro-rata
P a g e
18




basis, based on their holding of the ICNQ token. Club members are incentivized to hold more
ICNQ to increase their ability to participate in graduate’s token sales.
•   Exclusive Presales and Discounts: Startups joining the Iconiq Lab accelerator program get a
partial discount on their fees by paying with the ICNQ voucher token, increasing demand for
ICNQ on the open market.
•   ICON Members: Holders of €100,000 ICNQ tokens or more gain access to the premium ICON
club where they can engage the startups directly and do not have a limit to ICO contribution
amounts to graduates at the exclusive ICNQ discount. Club members are incentivized to hold
large amounts of ICNQ to unlock ICON benefits, decreasing the circulating supply.
Iconiq Funds Uses
•   ICON Share Class: Holders of €100,000 of ICNQ tokens or more gain privileged access to the
ICON  share  class  of  our  funds  and  planned  investment  vehicles,  such  as  ETFs,  enjoying
discounted management fees for the life of their subscription to Iconiq Funds’ index funds.
•   Fund Management Fees: Fund management fees are paid to the fund manager, Iconiq Funds,
in ICNQ tokens, systematically increasing demand on the open market for ICNQ as Assets
Under Management (AUM) of the planned multiple funds rises through fund underlying asset
value appreciation and the launch of new investment vehicles.
•   ICON Members: Platform fees may be paid in ICNQ tokens, providing a partial discount on
service fees to the AMaaS users. Fund managers pay platform fees in ICNQ tokens. As more
managers engage our platform and their UAM rises, so to does the demand for ICNQ.
Iconiq Media Uses
•   ICON Club: Premium ICON token holders get free entry to all Iconiq events.
•   Event Discounts: ICNQ token holders get discounts to participate in Iconiq Lab events and
other media through redeeming the ICNQ voucher token.
•   Participation Rewards: Participants and listeners of our Unbloqed podcasts and other media
events receive partial discounts when using the ICNQ voucher token.

4.4. ICNQ Smart Contract Framework
ICNQ Token Specifics
The ICNQ Token is an ERC20 compliant smart contract on the Ethereum public blockchain. The
tokens issued by the contract are a representation of the holder’s rights to participate in the Iconiq
Holding ecosystem as was previously described. The token is divisible up to 18 decimal points.
Iconiq Lab Smart Contract Framework
The ICNQ token is identified in an ICNQ Club Member’s ERC20 digital wallet by the smart contract
language each of the accelerator program graduates is contractually obligated to include in their
own token issuance. The contracts identify which wallets hold what proportion of the outstanding
ICNQ tokens and allow participation in a graduate’s presale to originate from said wallet on a pro-
rata basis. This ensures exclusivity of presales for the ICNQ Club members for program graduates.
ICNQ Token Assurances & Smart Contract Audit
The  ICNQ  smart  contract  has  been  audited  by  solidified.io,  one  of  the  most  reputable
independent, third-party, smart contract auditors in the industry. This provides prospective ICNQ
token holders quality assurance over their participation in the ICNQ token sale.
4.5. ICNQ Exchange Listings
Exchanges
500k ICNQ tokens will be sold on the GBX Grid, beginning on Oct. 29th. The sale is non-exclusive
to the GBX Grid. The token will be available to trade on the GBX Digital Asset Exchange after the
sale with crypto and fiat trading pairs. The token is currently trading on IDEX from the purchases
made in the prior community presale.
Related Party Transaction
Iconiq Lab Holding GmbH is an approved Sponsor Firm of GBX and is sponsoring the listing of
