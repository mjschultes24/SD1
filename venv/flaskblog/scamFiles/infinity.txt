INFINITY ECONOMICS PLATFORM
(IEP) WHITEPAPER

1. ABSTRACT
January 3rd 2009 marked the beginning of a new era of globalization and world interconnection
when the first Bitcoin transaction was conducted. Satoshi Nakamoto [1] made possible what was
once thought to be impossible - a currency and payment system not controlled by any person or
organization. We know this currency as Bitcoin and the underlying technology that powers it as
blockchain. It has been 8 years since people started using Bitcoin, but only now are we beginning
to understand the real potential of the blockchain technology on which Bitcoin is founded. Block -
chain does to economic processes what the Internet has done to information: today, anyone can
have access to the global economy on equal terms with others. In this document we talk about IEP,
a multipurpose blockchain platform made for users.
1.1 WHAT IS A BLOCKCHAIN?
A blockchain is a distributed database which enables the creation of a digital ledger of transac -
tions and the sharing of the ledger among a distributed network of computers. It uses advanced
cryptography to allow each participant on the network to interact with the ledger in a secure way
without the need for a central authority. It maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks),
each containing a timestamp and a link to the previous block.
1.2 SUMMARY
Crypto-currencies, tokens, digital coins and other digital assets based upon blockchain technology
are a mega trend that directly connects the finances of billions of people around the globe via a
financial superhighway. The financial superhighway brings together billions of individuals across
borders to directly trade products and services with one another anywhere over the Internet. Using
blockchain technologies, the value of such financial products and services - and the transactions
themselves - are stored in a system that cannot be diluted by politics, over-supply or altered in any
way by third parties. The use of blockchain will significantly impact the future of financial interac -
tions, rendering the traditional model of a centralized financial system - where individuals respond
to posted numbers on a centralized computer - inadequate for the extremely large number of
complex transactions that will be executed daily on the financial superhighway. IEP is a user- and
service-centric multipurpose blockchain platform and a cryptocurrency based on proven crypto
open source projects. IEP acts as a crypto-tech integrator, combining and enhancing existing and
new crypto-tech features and services into a single powerful platform for the digital economy.
1.3 TF;LR
IEP is the next-gen financial ecosystem. Its main goal is to integrate cryptocurrencies into the tra -
ditional financial world and to create a single gateway to the market for normal users, traders, in -
vestors and financial institutions by building a new full service and limitless decentralized financial
ecosystem and digital economy. In the initial phase, IEP primarily targets community-based and
humanitarian development and projects. To that end, decentralized voting and messaging are im -
plemented to allow for a DAO-like experience (Hybrid Governance) in managing community proj -
ects, whilst remaining straightforward from a technical aspect.

2. INTRODUCTION
Since its inception, blockchain technology has been fraught with controversy over its most natu -
ral application - value transfer using a network token. Decentralized money is a ground-breaking
development, but blockchain technology cannot be reduced to this alone. Being essentially a dis -
tributed database, the blockchain allows for various types of distributed ledger entries, the nature
of which depends on their interpretation by the blockchain’s users. IEP is an innovative, secure, de -
centralized and low transaction cost payment system built by using cutting-edge  cryptocurrency
technologies, designed to create entire digital economies akin to traditional financial services.
2.1 MISSION AND GOALS
IEP’s mission is to make the daunting cryptocurrency market accessible to everybody, accelerating
adoption of blockchain technology and democratisizing ownership of cryptocurrencies. IEP makes
cryptocurrencies easier to purchase and transfer, allowing the average individual to participate in
the New Economy. The IEP foundation believes in the philosophical mission established by Satoshi
Nakamoto. By creating a secure layer that is accessible to the average person, they put the power
in the hands of the people - where it belongs.
2.2 CURRENT CHALLENGES IN THE MARKET
The future success of cryptocurrencies relies on their widespread use. While crypto certainly has
the potential to rise as a global payment method, it remains the victim of speculation. Currently,
most users are treating cryptocurrencies as speculative assets rather than using them in daily life.
Given the sector’s exponential growth and the way blockchain technology is becoming increas -
ingly mainstream, many are optimistic that digital currencies will be used more as a currency and
less as a speculative asset. Though several new blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies
have emerged over the past few years, none have yet achieved the breakthrough success required
for mainstream adoption - primarily due to negative publicity, bubble speculations, scams, and
complicated user-interfaces. Hacking and other cyberattacks on crypto exchanges, and directly
on users’ devices and wallets, have also contributed to the overall uncertainty which accompanies
this new technology.
2.3 ADDRESSED ISSUES
Cryptocurrency is a decentralized blockchain based financial system with immutability and auton -
omy being its most celebrated features. Cryptocurrencies enable one to bypass intermediaries
and remain independent from traditional financial institutions. However, no cryptocurrency, includ -
ing Bitcoin, has managed to become a commonly used monetary asset. Merchants and service
providers are reluctant to accept cryptocurrency payments as it involves additional risks of ex -
change losses and regulatory issues as well as high volatility. An instrument capable of becoming
a perfect global payment system is commonly used as a speculative asset. This project is devised
as a solution for the fundamental problem in question, and takes into account the problems and
challenges faced by the current global financial system.

3. TECHNOLOGY
IEP is a 100% proof-of-stake cryptocurrency[11], constructed from proven open source projects[3]
written in Java. IEP’s unique proof-of-stake algorithm does not depend on any implementation of
the “coin age” concept used by other proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, and is resistant to so-called
“nothing at stake” attacks. A total quantity of 9 billion available tokens were distributed in the gen -
esis block. Curve25519[8] cryptography is used to provide a balance of security and required pro -
cessing power, along with more commonly-used SHA256 hashing algorithms [13].
3.1 TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
Blocks are generated every 60 seconds, on average, by accounts that are unlocked on network
nodes. Since the full token supply already exists, IEP is redistributed through the inclusion of trans -
action fees which are awarded to an account when it successfully creates a block. This process is
known as forging, and is akin to the “mining” concept employed by other cryptocurrencies. Trans -
actions are deemed safe after 10 block confirmations, and IEP’s current architecture and block
size cap allows for the processing of up to 367,200 transactions per day, with unlimited scalability
potential. IEP transactions are based on a series of core transaction types that do not require any
script processing or transaction input/output processing on the part of network nodes.
3.2 PROOF-OF-STAKE (POS)
IEP uses a system where each “token“ in an account can be thought of as a tiny mining rig [11]. The
more tokens that are held in the account, the greater the chance that account will earn the right
to generate a block. The total “reward“ received as a result of block generation is the sum of the
transaction fees located within the block. IEP does not generate any new tokens as a result of
block creation. Redistribution of IEP takes place as a result of block generators receiving transac -
tion fees, so the term “forging“ (meaning in this context “to create a relationship or new conditions“)
is used instead of “mining”. Subsequent blocks are generated based on verifiable, unique, and
almost unpredictable information from the preceding block. Blocks are linked by virtue of these
connections, creating a chain of blocks (and transactions) that can be traced all the way back to the
genesis block. Block generation time is targeted at 60 seconds, but variations in probabilities have
resulted in an average block generation time of 80 seconds, with occasionally longer block inter -
vals. The security of the blockchain is always of concern in proof-of-stake systems. The following
basic principles apply to IEP proof-of-stake algorithm:
-  A cumulative difficulty value is stored as a parameter in each block and each subsequent block
derives its new “difficulty” from the previous block’s value. In case of ambiguity, the network
achieves consensus by selecting the block or chain fragment with the highest cumulative
difficulty.
-  To prevent account holders from moving their stake from one account to another as a means of
manipulating their probability of block generation, tokens must be stationary within an account
for 1,440 blocks before they can contribute to the block generation process. Tokens that meet
this criterion contribute to an account’s effective balance. This balance is used to determine
forging probability.
-  To keep an attacker from generating a new chain all the way from the genesis block, the network
only allows chain re-organization of 720 blocks behind the current block height. Any block sub -

mitted at a height lower than this threshold is rejected. This moving threshold may be viewed as
IEP’s only fixed checkpoint.
-  Due to the extremely low probability of any account taking control of the blockchain by gener -
ating its own chain of blocks, transactions are deemed safe once they are encoded into a block
that is 10 blocks behind the current block height.
3.3 TOKEN
The total supply is 9 billion tokens, divisible to eight decimal places. All tokens were issued with the
creation of the genesis block (the first block in the IEP blockchain), leaving the genesis account [C]
with an initial negative balance of 9 billion tokens. The existence of anti-tokens in the genesis ac -
count has a couple of interesting side effects:
-  The genesis account cannot issue transactions of any kind, since its balance is negative and it
cannot pay transaction fees.
-  Any tokens sent to the genesis account are effectively destroyed, since that account’s negative
balance will cancel them out.
The choice of the word tokens is intentional due to IEP’s intention to be used as a base protocol
that provides numerous other functions. IEP’s most basic function is one of a traditional payment
system, but it was designed to do far more.
3.4 NODES
A node on the IEP network is any device that is contributing transaction or block data to the net -
work. Any device running the IEP software is seen as a node. Nodes can be subdivided into two
types: hallmarked and normal. A hallmarked node is simply a node that is tagged with an encrypt -
ed token derived from an account’s private key; this token can be decoded to reveal a specific
token account address and balance that are associated with a node. The act of placing a hallmark
on a node adds a level of accountability and trust, so hallmarked nodes are more trusted than
non-hallmarked nodes on the network. The larger the balance of an account tied to a hallmarked
node, the more trust is given to that node. While an attacker might wish to hallmark a node in or -
der to gain trustworthiness within the network and then use that trust for malicious purposes, the
barrier to entry (cost of token required to build adequate trust) discourages such abuse. Each node
on the IEP network has the ability to process and broadcast both transactions and block informa -
tion. Blocks are validated as they are received from other nodes [I]. In cases where block validation
fails, nodes may be “blacklisted” temporarily to prevent the propagation of invalid block data. Each
node features built-in DDOS (Distributed Denial of Services) defence mechanisms which restrict
the number of network requests from any peer to 30 per second.
3.5 BLOCKS
As in other cryptocurrencies, the ledger of token transactions is built and stored in a linked series
of blocks known as a blockchain. This ledger provides a permanent record of transactions that
have taken place and also establishes the order in which transactions have occurred. A copy of the
blockchain is kept on every node in the IEP network and every account that is unlocked on a node

(by supplying that account’s private key) has the ability to generate blocks as long as at least one
incoming transaction to the account has been confirmed 1440 times. Any account that meets these
criteria is referred to as an active account. In IEP, each block contains up to 255 transactions, all
prefaced by a 192 byte header that contains identifying parameters. Each transaction in a
block is represented by a maximum of 160 bytes and the maximum block size is 32KB. All blocks
contain the following parameters:
- A block version, block height value, and block identifier
- A block timestamp, expressed in seconds since the genesis block
- The ID of the account that generated the block, as well as that account’s public key
- The ID and hash of the previous block. The number of transactions stored in the block
- The total amount of token represented by transactions and fees in the block
- Transaction data for all transactions included in the block, including their transaction IDs
- The payload length of the block and the hash value of the block payload
3.6 BLOCK CREATION
Three values are key to determining which account is eligible to generate a block, which account
earns the right to generate a block, and which block is taken to be the authoritative one in times of
conflict: base target value, target value and cumulative difficulty.
Base Target Value
In order to win the right to forge (generate) a block, all active IEP accounts “compete” by attempt -
ing to generate a hash value that is lower than a given base target value. This base target value
varies from block to block and is derived from the previous block’s base target value.
Target Value
Each account calculates its own target value based on its current effective stake.
This value is: T = Tb × S × Be
where:
T                                                                                                       is the new target value
Tb     is the base target value
S                                                                                                       is the time since the last block, in seconds
Be     is the effective balance of the account
As can be seen from the formula, the target value grows with each second that passes since the
timestamp of the previous block. The maximum target value is 0.17080318 × 10e17 and the mini -
mum target value is one half of the previous block’s base target value. This target value and the
base target value are the same for all accounts attempting to forge on top of a specific block.
The only account-specific parameter is the effective balance parameter.

Cumulative Difficulty
The cumulative difficulty value is derived from the base target value, using the formula:
Dcb = Dpb + 264 / Tb
where:
Dcb    is the difficulty of the current block
Dpb   is the difficulty of the previous block
Tb     is the base target value for the current block [j]
The Forging Algorithm
Each block on the chain has a generation signature parameter. To participate in the block forging
process, an active account cryptographically signs the generation signature of the previous block
with its own public key. This creates a 64-byte signature, which is then hashed using SHA256. The
first 8 bytes of the resulting hash gives a number referred to as the account’s hit. The hit is com -
pared to the current target value. If the computed hit is lower than the target, then the next block
can be generated. As noted in the target value formula, the target value increases with each pass -
ing second. Even if there are only a few active accounts on the network, one of them will eventually
generate a block because the target value will become very large. The corollary of this is that you
can estimate the time that will be required for any account to forge a block by comparing that ac -
count’s hit value to the target value. When an active account wins the right to generate a block, it
bundles up to 255 available, unconfirmed transactions into a new block, and populates the block
with all of its required parameters. This block is then broadcast to the network as a candidate for
the blockchain. The payload value, generating account, and all of the signatures on each block can
be verified by all network nodes who receive it. In a situation where multiple blocks are generated,
nodes will select the block with the highest cumulative difficulty value as the authoritative block.
As block data is shared between peers, forks (non-authoritative chain fragments) are detected and
dismantled by examining the chains’ cumulative difficulty values stored in each fork.
3.7 ACCOUNTS
IEP implements a brain wallet as part of its design: all accounts are stored on the network with pri -
vate keys for each possible account address directly derived from each account’s passphrase us -
ing a combination of SHA256 and Curve25519 operations. Each account is represented by a 64-bit
number, and this number is expressed as an account address using a Reed-Solomon [k] error-cor-
recting notation that allows for detection of up to four errors in an account address, or correction
of up to two errors. This format was implemented in response to concerns that a mistyped account
address could result in tokens, aliases, or assets being irreversibly transferred to erroneous desti -
nation accounts. Account addresses are always prefaced by “XIN”, making token account address -
es easily recognizable and distinguishable from address formats used by other cryptocurrencies.
The Reed-Solomon-encoded account address associated with a secret passphrase is generated
as follows:
1.                                                                                                       The secret passphrase is hashed with SHA256 to derive the account’s private key.
2.  The private key is encrypted with Curve25519 to derive the account’s public key.
3.  The public key is hashed with SHA256 to derive the account ID.
4.  The first 64 bits of the account ID are the visible account number.
5.  Reed-Solomon encoding of the visible account number, prefixed with  “XIN”, generates the
account address.

When an account is accessed by a secret passphrase for the very first time, it is not secured by a
public key. When the first outgoing transaction from an account is made, the 256-bit public key
derived from the passphrase is stored on the blockchain. This secures the account. The address
space for public keys (2256) is larger than the address space for account numbers (264), so there
is no one-to-one mapping of passphrases to account numbers. So collisions are possible. These
collisions are detected and prevented in the following way: once a specific passphrase is used to
access an account, and that account is secured by a 256-bit public key, no other public/private key
pair is permitted to access that account number.
Account Balance Properties
For each IEP account, several different types of balances are available. Each type serves a different
purpose, and many of these values are checked as part of transaction validation and processing.
-  The effective balance of an account is used as the basis for an account’s forging calculations [L].
An account’s effective balance consists of all tokens that have been stationary in that account
for 1440 blocks. In addition, the Account Leasing feature allows an account’s effective balance
to be assigned to another account for a temporary period.
-  The guaranteed balance of an account consists of all tokens that have been stationary in an
account for 1440 blocks. Unlike the effective balance, this balance cannot be assigned to any
other account.
-  The basic balance of an account represents all transactions that have had at least one confir -
mation.
-  The forged balance of an account shows the total quantity of token that have been earned as a
result of successfully forging blocks.
-  The unconfirmed balance of an account is the one that is displayed in IEP clients. It represents
the current balance of an account, minus the tokens involved in unconfirmed, sent transactions.
-  Guaranteed asset balances list the guaranteed balances of all the assets associated with a spe -
cific account.
-  Unconfirmed asset balances list the unconfirmed balances of all the assets associated with a
specific account.
3.8 TRANSACTIONS
Transactions are the only means IEP accounts have of altering their state or balance. Each trans -
action performs only one function: The record of which is permanently stored on the network once
that transaction has been included in a block.
Transaction Fees
Transaction fees are the primary mechanism through which tokens are recirculated back into the
network. Every transaction requires a minimum fee of 1 token while several services like aliases,
assets or voting, require higher fees. When an IEP account forges a block, all of the transaction fees

(IEP) WHITEPAPER
Created by the IEP Community
included in that block are awarded to the forging account as a reward. Until the size of all the trans -
actions in a block exceeds the current 32 kilobyte block size limit, the minimum fee will be suffi -
cient for all transactions to be included in blocks. In situations where the number of unconfirmed
transactions exceeds the number that can be placed in a block, forging accounts will likely select
transactions with the highest fees. This suggests that transaction processing may be prioritized by
including a fee that is higher than the minimum.
Transaction Confirmations
All IEP transactions are considered unconfirmed until they are included in a valid network block.
Newly created blocks are distributed to the network by the node (and associated account) that
creates them. A transaction that is included in a block is considered as having received one con -
firmation. As subsequent blocks are added to the existing blockchain, each additional block adds
one more confirmation to the number of confirmations for a transaction. If a transaction is not in -
cluded in a block before its deadline, it expires and is removed from the transaction pool.
Transaction Deadlines
Every transaction contains a deadline parameter set to a number of minutes from the time the
transaction is submitted to the network. The default deadline is 1440 minutes (24 hours). A transac -
tion that has been broadcast to the network but has not been included in a block is referred to as
an unconfirmed transaction. If a transaction has not been included in a block before the transaction
deadline expires, the transaction is removed from the network. Transactions may be left uncon -
firmed because they are invalid or malformed or because blocks are being filled with transactions
that have offered to pay higher transaction fees. In the future, features such as multi-signature
transactions may be able to take advantage of deadlines as a means of enforcing an expiry date.
Transaction Types
Categorizing IEP transactions into types and subtypes allows for modular growth and develop -
ment of the IEP protocol without creating dependencies on other “base” functions. As features are
added to the IEP core, new transaction types and subtypes can be added to support them. (During
integration additional transaction types like subscriptions, escrow and automated transactions are
added, named as advanced transactions.)
Transaction Creation and Processing
The details of creating and processing an IEP transaction are as follows:
1.                                                                                                         The sender specifies parameters for the transaction. Types of transactions vary. The desired
type is specified at transaction creation, but several parameters must be specified for all trans -
actions:
- The private key for the sending account
- A specified fee for the transaction
- A deadline for the transaction
- An optional referenced transaction
2.   All values for the transaction inputs are checked. For example, mandatory parameters must be
specified; fees cannot be less than or equal to zero; a transaction deadline cannot be less than
one minute into the future; if a referenced transaction is specified, then the current transaction
cannot be processed until the referenced transaction has been processed.

3. If no exceptions are thrown as a result of parameter checking:
a.)  The public key for the generating account is computed using the supplied secret pass -
phrase
b.)  Account information for the generating account is retrieved, and transaction parameters
are further validated:
- The sending account’s balance cannot be zero
-  The sending account’s unconfirmed balance must not be lower than the transaction
amount plus the transaction fee
4.  If the sending account has sufficient funds for the transaction:
a.)  A new transaction is created, with a type and subtype value set to match the kind of trans -
action being made. All specified parameters are included. A unique transaction ID is gener -
ated with the creation of the object
b.)  The transaction is signed using the sending account’s private key
c.)  The encrypted transaction data is placed within a message instructing network peers to
process the transaction
d.)  The transaction is broadcast to all peers on the network
e.)  The server responds with a result code:
- the transaction ID, if the transaction creation was successful
- an error code and error message if any of the parameter checks fail
3.9 CRYPTOGRAPHY
Introduction
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)[8] is a public key cryptography method that uses elliptic curves
and algebraic structures over finite fields. ECC provides security using smaller keys than other
cryptographic methods. ECC can be used for key agreement, digital signatures, pseudo-random
generators, etc. ECC can be used for indirect encryption by using a symmetric encryption scheme
with the key agreement. Key exchange in IEP is based on the Curve25519 algorithm, which gener -
ates a shared secret key using a fast, efficient, high-security elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman function [7].
The algorithm was first demonstrated by Daniel J. Bernstein in 2006 [8]. IEP’s Message signing in
IEP is implemented using the Elliptic Curve Korean Certificate based Digital Signature Algorithm
(EC-KCDSA), specified as part of IEEE P1363a by the KCDSA Task Force team in 1998 [9]. Both algo-
rithms were chosen for their balance of speed and security for a key size of only 32 bytes.
Encryption Algorithm
When Alice sends an encrypted plain text to Bob, she:
1.                                                                                                            Calculates a shared secret:
- shared_secret = Curve25519 (Alice_private_key, Bob_public_key)
2.   Calculates N seeds:
- seedn = SHA256 (seedn-1 ), where seed0 = SHA256 (shared_secret)
3.   Calculates N keys:
- keyn = SHA256 (Inv (seedn)), where Inv(X) is the inversion of all bits of X
4.  Encrypts the plaintext:
- ciphertext [n] = plaintext [n] XOR keyn
Upon receipt, Bob decrypts the ciphertext:

- shared_secret = Curve25519 (Bob_private_key, Alice_public_key)
2.  Calculates N seeds (this is identical to Alice’s step):
- seedn = SHA256 (seedn-1 ), where seed0 =SHA256 (shared_secret)
3.  Calculates N keys (this is identical to Alice’s step):
- keyn = SHA256 (Inv(seedn)), where Inv(X) is the inversion of all bits of X
4.  Decrypts the ciphertext:
- plaintext [n] = ciphertext [n] XOR keyn
Note: If someone guesses part of the plaintext, he can decode some part of subsequent messages
between Alice and Bob if they use the same key pairs. As a result, it’s advised to generate a new
pair of private/public keys for each communication.
3.10 ARCHITECTURE
First-generation cryptocurrencies were primarily designed as payment systems. IEP recognizes
that decentralized blockchains can enable a broad range of applications and services, but is not
prescriptive about what those services should be or how they should be built. By design, IEP strips
away unnecessary complexity in its core, leaving only the most successful components of its pre -
decessors intact. As a result, IEP functions like a low-level, foundational protocol: it defines the in -
terfaces and operations required to operate a lightweight blockchain, a decentralized communica -
tion system, and a rapid transaction processing framework, allowing higher-order components to
build on those features. Transactions in IEP make simple adjustments to account balances instead
of tracing sets of “input” or “output” credits. In addition, the core software does not support any
form of scripting language. By providing a set of basic, flexible transaction types that can quickly
and easily be processed, IEP creates a foundation that does not limit the ways in which those trans -
action types can be used, and does not create significant overhead for using them. This flexibility is
further amplified by IEP’s low resource and energy requirements, and its highly readable and highly
organized object-oriented source code.
3.11 TOOLCHAINS
IEP is focused on industry standards for all platform developments. The core is written in enterprise
friendly Java[D], the backends are powered by NodeJS[E] and all frontends are built with AngularJS [F],
making it easy to allocate developer resources anytime, anywhere. Cross platform apps are built
with electron[G]. The default backend storage is MongoDB[H]. This toolchain gives the foundation
much more freedom to choose the best developers/contractors for all upcoming programming
tasks, since the developer communities for those tools is matured and large with plenty of proven
components and frameworks.

3.12 INTEGRATION
The cryptospace is evolving very rapidly. New technologies and powerful protocols and compo -
nents are developed daily. To address this devstream, IEP monitors the whole crypto development
attentively for additional features worth adding to the IEP platform either for the core or for the ser -
vices. New transaction types can be added on the fly to expand the core with powerful features as
needed. This way IEP acts as a crypto-feature-integrator to always provide state of the art building
blocks for the digital economy. All new features are introduced to the community for voting and
acceptance prior to implementation.
4. FEATURES
IEP is designed to integrate building blocks for the digital economy and therefore relies heavily on
secure and robust off-chain infrastructure to reach the average user. To achieve this objective, the
IEP core and client is built for easy extensability [14] and connection to others, very useful protocols
and networks. IEP isn’t meant to act as an island like most cryptos, but to embrace and welcome
all new technologies, from very classical to the most advanced. Most services are based on IEP’s
enhanced core implementations like proxies and gateways. Services can be public or private, run -
ning as UI-less bots or even as extensions within the wallet UI. Services play a very important
role in IEP’s future development and growth strategy, therefore, the foundation will facilitate the
enhancement of those services and initiate or even develop community relevant services like the
enhanced encrypted messaging/chat or news services with external contractors. The list of real -
ized/planned services is growing constantly. Please refer to wallet extensions to get an overview
about already implemented and planned services.
4.1 PAYMENTS
Tokens (XIN) are most relevant to the user. A transfer transaction type is used to transfer tokens
from one account to another. A small encrypted message can be attached to each transaction
for an additional fee. The fee for a simple transfer is 1 token. Token transfers are simple, fast, and
cost-effective and mostly settled within just 60 seconds. Anonymous transfers are possible using
the built-in coin shuffling function.
4.2 ALIASES
The IEP Alias System feature essentially allows one piece of text to be substituted for another, so
that keywords or keyphrases can be used to represent other things, names, telephone numbers,
physical addresses, web sites, account numbers, email addresses, product SKU codes and more.
Immediate applications are simple: you can create an easy-to-remember alias for your IEP account,
for example. But since the Alias System is open-ended, it can be used to implement a decentral -
ized DNS system, shopping cart applications, proxies into other blockchains, oracles, references
to stored files in bittorrent or IPFS[6] or even as your entry point into decentralized webhosting like
ZeroNet[2]. Aliases can be edited, transferred or sold to public or specific accounts with the built-in
alias marketplace.
4.3 MESSAGES
Encrypted messages commonly take the form of SMS-length communications between users.
Transmission of encrypted data messages up to 160 bytes in length can be transferred from any
13




INFINITY ECONOMICS PLATFORM
(IEP) WHITEPAPER
Created by the IEP Community
account to any other account as a single message. Encrypted messages can also be attached to
many transactions like token transfer, asset transfer and currency transfer. Encrypted messages
are permanently stored into the blockchain and limited in size to prevent blockchain bloat. They
also require a dynamic fee, based on the size of the message and should be used for important
and immutable messages. The encryption algo is AES. The upcoming, community based messen -
ger service allows up to 1.000 bytes and lasts 1.000 messages without a service fee. Messages can
also be used to trigger transaction events, for instance to chain payments or to invoke distributed
services.
4.4 ASSETS
The Asset Exchange is IEP’s built-in decentralised trading engine. Using the Asset Exchange, you
can create, buy and sell assets that represent data beyond simple coin transfers which opens up
wide-ranging possibilities. The Asset Exchange is based on the “coloured coins” concept whereby
a coin or a set of coins can be designated (“coloured”) to represent something else. By contrast,
many crypto currencies only ever operate as just currencies and nothing more. However, since the
blockchain provides a trustworthy and permanent ledger of all transactions, it can be used to re -
cord far more diverse information than purely currency transactions. IEP tokens can be designated
(“coloured”) to represent other crypto coins, stocks/bonds, property, commodities, or even ideas.
As a result, the IEP network can be used to trade almost anything. The Asset Exchange is suitable
for most use cases where users like to buy and sell virtual company shares, fiat-pegged assets,
rewarding points, or even crypto backed asssets. Not for HFT trading, however, since the Asset
Exchange is decentralized and running with a 60s. blocktime confirmation. The Asset Exchange
is completely decentralised and completely unregulated. The substantial benefits this offers are
freedom, cost savings and lack of intervention. But it also comes at a price. There is no hand-hold -
ing or policing and scam assets can be and often are created. Whilst the community generally
picks up on these relatively quickly, if you make a mistake, then there is very little recourse as
transactions are irreversible. Before buying an asset, you should at least understand what an asset
represents and clarify any doubts with the issuer.
4.5 CURRENCIES
The currency entity is the basic building block of the IEP Currencies System. A currency has a
unique name and code and uniqueness is guaranteed by the protocol. Currencies can be deleted
and their code can be reused under certain conditions. The total currency supply is divisible into
currency units. Like assets, currency units support decimal positions implemented as a client side
feature. The maximum number of currency units which can be issued per currency is similar to to -
ken 10^9 * 10^8. The actual maximum units supply is set by the currency issuer. The currency issuer
is the account which issues the currency and pays the issuance fee. The issuer is responsible for
setting the currency properties and in some configurations has additional control over the currency
usage. Like asset balance, currency units can be transferred between accounts.
4.6 CROWDFUNDING
Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising monetary contributions
from a large number of people. Crowdfunding is a form of crowdsourcing and of alternative fi -
nance. Crowdfunding is generally based on three types of actors: the project initiator who propos -
es the idea and/or project to be funded, individuals or groups who support the idea, and a moder -
ating organization (the “platform”) that brings the parties together to launch the idea. During 2013,
14




INFINITY ECONOMICS PLATFORM
(IEP) WHITEPAPER
Created by the IEP Community
$5.1 billion USD was raised by millions of individuals! However, the biggest disincentive to using
websites such as Kickstarter is their fees. Kickstarter demands 5% of the money raised as a fee, and
payment processing fees are another 5%, which in the era of blockchain technology is a little diffi -
cult to justify. Based on the built-in currency feature, IEP offers this “platform” as a fully automatic
decentralized solution for simple, fast and affordable crowdfunding. Crowdfunding can be used
to fund a wide range of for-profit entrepreneurial ventures such as artistic and creative projects,
medical expenses, travel, community-oriented social entrepreneurship, charity or humanitarian
projects.
4.7 ESCROW
An escrow service allows safer payment by securely holding a buyer’s coins in escrow until the
terms of the sale are met. As a result the buyer releases payment to the seller. In most cases, no
dispute is filed and no 3rd party action is needed. IEP provides a decentralized escrow service
based on the new enhanced transaction types. If you’re selling your car or house using IEP decen -
tralized asset service, you can easily put the funds up in Escrow and when the title is delivered in
your name, you release the money. Even the title can be delivered using an IEP Smart Contract.
It costs less than a few pennies to make all of this happen; unlike traditional banking and selling
transactionsm it doesn’t cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. Escrow can have as much as 10
co-signers and provides several decision actions like return, split and release.
4.8 SUBSCRIPTIONS
Managing and Scaling Subscriptions were complex. Until now. IEP offers decentralized recurring
payments that users can initiate and cancel at any time. Recurring payments work well for services
that require multiple payments over time. They also fund special accounts to ensure a minimum
balance height. Subscriptions are built on the new enhanced transaction framework and allow
users to make payments of any size and interval to other accounts. Subscriptions are an important
new feature for the upcoming digital marketplace.
4.9 SHUFFLING
CoinShuffle[5] improves user privacy by frustrating attempts to link transactions to a particular user.
A participant can increase their anonymity by making it impossible to determine exactly who paid
whom because inputs and outputs are indistinguishable (even to other participants). Each partic -
ipant knows which output they own, but cannot link the inputs and outputs of the other partici -
pant. CoinShuffle also allows the identification and elimination of malicious participants caught
misbehaving. Coin-shuffling is an effective privacy feature and enables participants to mix their
funds quickly and efficiently with other participants’ funds by creating a random mapping between
existing participants’ accounts and new recipient accounts provided by the users. The shuffling
algorithm is based on a paper by Tim Ruffing [5] and was originally developed to be implemented
in Bitcoin itself. CoinShuffle differs from other existing solutions like ZeroCash [12] in terms of speed
and complexity.
4.10 VOTING
Blockchain technology lends itself well to use in voting systems. By providing a secure way for each
person to register their vote on a public record whilst still maintaining the option for users to re -
15




INFINITY ECONOMICS PLATFORM
(IEP) WHITEPAPER
Created by the IEP Community
main anonymous, and with little possibility for anybody to tamper with those votes, the blockchain
is able to offer significant improvements over current systems in terms of security and transparen -
cy. The secure, encrypted, consensus-based nature of the IEP network allows the implementation
of a voting system that guarantees anonymity and security, without relying on a central authority
to tally votes. The IEP Voting System enables any account to create a poll with one question and
up to 10 answers. Accounts are eligible to vote in the poll based on a minimum required balance
of token, an asset or a currency. Voting consists of selecting an integer range value to associate
with one or more answers as specified during poll creation. An answer is given weight based on
one of four voting models and then its weight is multiplied by the associated range value to com -
pute a corresponding result. The four voting models specify weight as: one per voting account, or
equal to the balance per voting account of token, an asset or a currency. An aggregate weight for
each answer is computed as the sum of all individual vote weights; likewise, an aggregate result is
computed. Individual votes are saved until at least 1441 blocks after the poll completes, typically
more than a day. After this time, votes are deleted and only aggregate weights and results remain
available.
4.11 AUTOMATED TRANSACTIONS
One of the most promising applications of the blockchain technology are Smart Contracts. Smart
Contracts are computer programs that can automatically execute the terms of a contract. Anyone
familiar with computer programming would be aware of what is known as an if-then-else state -
ment, where a program executes a certain task if certain conditions are met, and does not if the
conditions are not present. Smart Contracts implement this on the blockchain and have the poten -
tial to extend this into another growing field, and that is the internet of things, bringing the world of
sci-fi closer to reality. For instance, Atomic Cross Chain Transactions allow for truly decentralized
trading between cryptocurrencies. This can, for example, enable a trader to exchange token with
a coin that provides a mixing service for the purposes of privacy and then send it to a new wallet.
Another Smart Contract example that IEP would be able to support are auctions. IEP enables you to
create a smart Auction Contract. Participants in the auction would then send money to the contract.
And anytime anyone sends more money than the previous bidder, the previous bidder’s money is
automatically refunded. Future Smart Contracts that IEP intends to support include autonomous
corporations, gambling, self-mixing and smart properties. Smart Contracts are being touted as the
“killer app” of the cryptocurrency industry. The race is on to develop applications that will radically
transform our work, life, and play, going forward into the future.
4.12 GATEWAYS
An application-gateway is a device (node) that acts as a “gate” between two networks. Today, ser -
vice developers are facing many problems when building custom services distributed to a huge
number of clients. Firstly, they need to master several different technologies and go through frame -
work specific APIs. Secondly, applications developed for one framework will not work in another
framework. And thirdly, the data collected and the actions provided by devices need to be mapped
to the service model. IEP’s application gateways provide a convenient solution for service devel -
opers to access several services and protocols. Gateways are an important future development for
the IE platform to “connect” services like IPFS [6] (Interplanetary Filesystem), used for decentralized
storage, ZERONET[2], used for decentralized hosting, and Tendermint[4], used for side and private
chains solutions[10]. Since gateways are running within core-scope, services can directly interact
with IEP’s blockchain and transaction models. When a client program establishes a connection to
16




INFINITY ECONOMICS PLATFORM
(IEP) WHITEPAPER
Created by the IEP Community
a destination service, it connects to the IEP application gateway. The client then negotiates with
the node in order to communicate with the destination service. In effect, the client establishes the
connection with the destination and acts on behalf of the client. Due to its transparent API access, if
configured, gateways are reachable from within IEP’s smart wallet. This expands the wallet feature
set greatly. Gateways can be used for public or private services.
4.13 PROXIES
A proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for
requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server,
requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource available from a
different server. The proxy server then evaluates the request as a way to simplify and control its
complexity. Proxies were invented to add structure and encapsulation to distributed systems. IEP
provides several in-core proxies which can be extended easily and accessed with simple HTTP
GET requests. Proxies are playing an important role in IEP’s interconnectivity strategy, enabling
the IE platform to “reach out” for additional services and features running within the core-scope.
Running within core-space enables proxy data to interact with IEP’s blockchain, transactions and
notification system, making it easy to build public or private services. Due to its transparent API ac -
cess, proxies are reachable from IEP’s smart wallet too. Current proxies are used to fetch realtime
data from exchanges and block explorers for the cryptocurrency market but they are not limited to
those. More proxies connecting to common data services are in development.
4.14 EXTENSIONS
Extensions enable third-party software developers to add functionality to the IEP Smart Client Inter-
face. Extensions/Services are an important part for the IEP platform to gain traction in common mar-
kets, accessable directly by the smart wallet. In most cases, those extensions are based on services
built by developers to “connect” those to the IE platform, for instance, due to payment logic or data
services. Since plugins have unrestricted access including sensitive data and functionality, it is very
important to install only trusted extensions. If there is any doubt, install an extension only on the Test-
net or on Mainnet with accounts having small balances. Extensions are authored by third party devel-
opers and receive an intense peer review prior to release. The foundation will prepare a “best practice”
and signed/approved extension marketplace including a comprehensive code review and ranking.
4.15 ACCOUNT CONTROL
Account security is possibly the leading issue with the use of crypto-currency: How can a user se -
cure digital funds so that they are completely safe from theft, given the increasing sophistication of
malware and hacking techniques? Account control enhances the security of accounts and ensures
that only specific people have access to funds under specific conditions. Multisignature (often
called multisig) for instance, refers to requiring more than one key to authorize a transaction. This
enables users to create accounts that can only transact with the approval of holders of specified
assets or currencies, or to make transactions subject to votes on spendings. Multisignature is a
form of technology used to add additional security for token transactions. Multisignature requires
additional users to sign (approve) a transaction before it can be added onto the blockchain. Phas -
ing is another feature that allows certain phasing-safe transactions to be created on a list of linked
transactions or on the revelation of a secret with conditional deferred execution based on the re -
sult of a vote; or simply with unconditional deferred execution.

4.16 LIGHT CLIENT
The classic Bitcoin approach is essentially a way to synchronize a distributed system through com -
mon transaction logs. It requires that each network node store the full copy of the transaction
history. Obviously this does not scale well, since eventually not every node will be able to store
the full history. There are different ways to mitigate a simplified payment verification procedure
that allows storage of only that data essential for a given node; off-chain transactions; bidirectional
payment tunnels; reducing blockchain bloat; working directly with the system state. With the sim -
plest approach, where all nodes are equal at Genesis block, centralization may emerge, as low-
capacity nodes have to rely on full, high-capacity nodes that can afford to store the full blockchain.
Of course emerging centralization brings trust issues, since lightweight nodes have to trust the full
nodes and can become a victim of a rogue full node. However, there are ways to mitigate this, such
as polling several nodes, maintaining trusted nodes lists, and so on. IEP provides a new structure
for these tasks by leveraging the peer explorer. The foundation maintains a base of trusted high
capacity servers to ensure sufficient nodes available for clients. A node rating algo is used to rank
the top nodes, count in the CPU load and represent available processors and more node metrics
in realtime to “load-balance” the client’s requests for optimal performance.
5. E-GOVERNANCE
From its beginning, IEP is designed to run as a 100% community driven project, meaning that the
power to decide about all platform-related matters belongs to all community members based on
their voting power. This approach can be seen as a DAO by its core definition since everything is
decentralized from platform to service development and from running nodes to marketing and
documentation. IEP follows these principles right from the beginning by handing over the power to
decide to its users, the only way a solid and fair crypto platform should be established to prevent
single points of failure. An IEP foundation was created to execute the communities’ will, no matter
what whales, VIPs or developers decide. To provide a tamperfree environment, the platform built-
in e-governance features are consequently used to improve the IEP platform. For instance, all IEP
features were voted on for release by the community prior to release.
5.1 DAO OVERVIEW
Decentralized autonomous organizations[1] have been seen by some as difficult to describe. Never -
theless, the conceptual essence of a decentralized autonomous organization has been typified as
the ability of blockchain technology to provide a secure digital ledger that tracks financial interac -
tions across the internet, hardened against forgery by trusted time-stamping and by dissemination
of a distributed database. This approach eliminates the need to involve a bilateral accepted and
trusted third party in a financial transaction, thus simplifying the sequence. The original theory un -
derlying the DAO was that by removing delegated power from directors and placing it directly in
the hands of owners, the DAO removed the ability of directors and fund managers to misdirect and
waste investor funds. The first known DAO was/is Bitcoin, but it lacks some important functions to
fulfill the “optimal” DAO. Simply defined, a mechanism called e-Governance is missing to function
as an expression of the token holder’s will.
5.2 SMART CONTRACTS SOLUTIONS
The first code-based only DAO was launched as a Smart Contract, running on the ethereum block -
chain as an investor-directed capital fund having no conventional management, structure or board
18




INFINITY ECONOMICS PLATFORM
(IEP) WHITEPAPER
Created by the IEP Community
of directors. The DAO was crowdfunded via a token sale in May 2016. It set the record for the largest
crowdfunding campaign in history, but in June 2016, hackers exploited a vulnerability in the DAO
code to enable them to siphon off one third of the DAO’s funds to a subsidiary account. Due to this
hack, a hard fork occurred where the original un-forked blockchain was maintained as Ethereum
Classic, thus breaking Ethereum into two separate active cryptocurrencies. Regardless of the hack,
even this code-based DAO needed actors in the physical world named “curators”, to monitor and
manage the DAO decisions on behalf of the DAO token holders which leads to the conclusion that,
no matter how advanced code based DAOs are, ultimately any DAO needs human interaction to
specify, organize and monitor deliverables, responsibilities, and other operating parameters for
external contractors.
5.3 IEP SOLUTION
Learning from the above problems and definitions, IEP DAO can be viewed as a hybrid DAO. Com -
pared to code based only DAOs, IEP has the following advantages:
1.) Flexibility ine-Governance
IEP DAO offers a rich set of already built-in governance tools, accessible and easy to use out of the
box for the average user. These tools are transparent, simple to set up and also easy to monitor,
without the need for complicated code constructs which are hard to test and to predict.
2.) Common sense enabled
While a maximum of automation has its benefits, it lacks flexibility and you can’t code common
sense. The foundation is deeply convinced that common sense is an important component to
prevent misuse and act dynamically on unforeseeable problems. As mentioned above, a final
human view with a healthy portion of common sense enriches the DAO and makes it much
more robust. Common sense is the final bastion if something goes wrong with the DAO.
3.) Fine granulation for proposal votings
Code-based proposal voting is limited to transactions/counting (yes/no) only. The IEP built-
in voting system has many advantages since it supports multiple choices and multiple voting
models. This results in much more precise proposal votings compared to simple yes/no solu -
tions. In many real world decisions a simple yes/no isn’t sufficient.
4.) Complete transparency
Proposals and voting on those proposals are not encapsulated in difficult to read contracts/
code. This allows non-developers to verify and monitor the whole proposal and voting outcome
simply by looking at the chain. Block explorer and the tools already built into the wallet are suf -
ficient for full transparency.
5.) Automated transaction as additional DAO solution
While the foundation prefers the above described DAO structure, the platform supports code
based DAOs too. The Automated Transactions (AT) feature (Alpha Status) can be used to create
Smart Contracts running on the IEP blockchain. It’s free to any user/developer to build their
own private or public DAO at minimal costs. Please see AT features for more information on
building a DAO running on the IEP blockchain.

6. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we put forth the concept of a platform for a digital economy. Cryptocurrencies are
changing the world right now, solving the problems of trust and security and uniting financial insti -
tutions, big investors, everyday users, and representatives of small, medium and large businesses
into a single global system. The IEP decentralized crypto ledger platform is an ambitious project
bringing together several changes on integration, client side features and middleware system ar -
rangements to form the basis of software solutions suitable for financial applications of today and
that of the future. Based on this new model, intermediaries will develop their own financial services
and build a distributed super financial market via IEP. We believe that a flexible, decentralized, val -
ue exchange system is the future of the new global financial infrastructure and will help to promote
financial inclusion and standardize future financial transactions. IEP’s design philosophy is in many
ways the opposite from that taken by many other cryptocurrencies today, relying on cooperation
and feature integration over island solutions.
