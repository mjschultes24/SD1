The exchange of value between parties has a long history, from barter all the way to the world of digital currencies.
Nowadays users expect to be able to transfer money at any given time of day (24/7), anywhere they might be on
the planet, to anyone regardless of their age or sex, instantly, for a low cost with ease. The real development phase
is just starting and it has plenty of business opportunities!
To be able to expand the range of alternative means of payment, there is a strong need for an easy-to-use e-Wallet
(an electronic device or online service that allows an individual to make electronic transactions), a stable price
payment asset, blockchain technology, a dedicated community and market players.
In a few years, almost half of the world's financial transactions will be made through e-wallets. Blockchain
technology has become an significant factor in the world of payments. These payment assets require some sort of
a “backing” in order to stay stable. In the international market, at least 48 stablecoin projects are developing
different solutions designed to make currencies less volatile. The Corion Foundation  - the author of this
whitepaper - is dedicated to assisting and supporting projects that offer blockchain-based stable price payment
solutions. Corion offers a common infrastructure for these projects, besides other general and unique services that
simplify the use of stablecoins. In order to achieve this, a mutual E-wallet, swap, merchant gateway will be
developed and marketed.
Corion Foundation is entering the market with a stablecoin (CorionPay) in the near future via a fintech company.
The Foundation's view is that there is great opportunity for alternative means of payment and their expansion.
Anyone who develops a business, business relationship, capital, or even a user site can benefit from it.
The Corion Foundation has created the CorionX utility token, which will be used partially for CorionPay backing,
for listing on Corion’s infrastructure (wallet, swap, merchant gateway), for using foundation services, and for
users to use the platform. The CorionX token (Ethereum-based ERC20 token) will be entering (Stablecoin Loyalty
Program) the market via the stablecoin community in 2018, which can only be purchased at exchanges later.
The Corion Foundation, which was registered in 2016 in Switzerland, is supported by a dedicated core team,
advisors and ambassadors. We are looking forward to welcoming new pioneers who want to contribute to the
historic breakthrough of the blockchain-based stable price payment assets, hereinafter stablecoins, thus making
Satoshi Nakamoto's dream of P2P payments.

2.1. Introduction
From barter to digital cash.
Money has been a part of human history for more than 5,000 years. From the origins of bartering to modern crypto
money, this is how the system has evolved. At the dawn of humanity, bartering was used in lieu of money to buy
goods. As man began to domesticate livestock, one of the earliest forms of barter included cattle, sheep, as well
as vegetables and grain.
The first known currency was created by King Alyattes in Lydia, now part of Turkey, in around 600BC. The first
coin ever minted features a roaring lion. Coins then evolved into bank notes around 1661 AD.
"We have gold because we can not trust governments," President Herbert Hoover famously said in his statement
in 1933 to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s inauguration.
The gold standard is a monetary system where a country's currency or paper money has a value directly linked to
gold. With the gold standard, countries were committed to convert their paper money into a fixed amount of gold.
A country that uses the gold standard sets a fixed price for gold and buys and sells gold at that price.That fixed
price is used to determine the value of the currency. The gold standard is not currently (2018) used by any
government. Britain stopped using the gold standard in 1931 and the U.S. followed suit in 1933 and abandoned
the remnants of the system in 1971. As World War II was coming to an end, the leading Western powers met to
develop the Bretton Woods Agreement, which would be the framework for the global currency markets until
1971. Within the Bretton Woods system, most of the national currencies were valued in relation to the U.S. dollar,
which was itself directly linked to gold. The dollar became the dominant reserve currency.

The gold standard was completely replaced by fiat money, a term used to describe currency that is issued by a
government and must be accepted as a means of payment within its territory. (more about the gold standard: here).
The first credit card was introduced in 1946.
The infographic below shows how money has developed from these early roots through to Apple's instant iPhone
payments and bitcoin  - the world's first decentralised blockchain-based cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, the first
cryptocurrency was born in the chaotic days of the last big financial crisis in 2008. The financial crisis of 2008
was, in part, due to unrealistic expectations of financial institutions. By accident or design - or a combination of
the two - large financial institutions engaged in practises in which they assumed the outcome had no downside
for them. By assuming the government would opt as a backstop, the bank’s actions were a good example of moral
hazard and behavior of people and institutions who think they are given a free option.
How did moral hazard contribute to the 2008 financial crisis? Read more: here
This moral hazard lead to the creation of the first Peer to Peer payment protocol by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin.
Bitcoin opened a gateway to the new technology of the internet in value transfer by using blockchain. Although
blockchain-based cryptocurrencies are in a embryonic age, they can assume all the functions of money: medium
of exchange, measure of value, store of value, unit of account, a standard of postponed payment, the basis of
credit.
Why do bitcoins have value?
Cryptocurrencies have value because they are useful as a form of money. Money is accepted because it is
accepted (this is paradox of money). Crypto has the characteristics of money (durability, portability, fungibility,
scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability) based on the properties of mathematics rather than relying on physical
properties (like gold and silver) or trust in central authorities (like fiat currencies). In short, Bitcoin and other
cryptos are backed by mathematics. With these attributes, all that is required for a form of money to hold value is
trust and acceptance. In the case of crypto, this can be measured by its growing base of users (merchants, startups,
individuals). As with all currency, bitcoin’s value comes only and directly from people willing to accept it as
payment.
Although cryptocurrencies are in a baby age, they can represent all the functions of money: medium of exchange,
measure of value, store of value, unit of account, a standard of postponed payment, the basis of credit.  Functions
of money? Read more: here
The most used function of the money is as medium of exchange and it is one of the most beneficial function that
crypto can add value to people.
The advent of modern - digital - bartering has brought the system full circle.

The near future payments and cryptocurrencies
Technological progress has come to a level where it ensures that people can solve their daily payment challenges
with a single smartphone.
Technology allows other solutions an alternative - alternative to traditional bank payment systems.
(In the near future, the word "alternative" will disappear as it becomes a part of everyday use, taking over from
traditional bank transfers and credit card payments)
It’s a basic expectation in the 21st century that bank transfers are accessible to everyone, immediately,
inexpensively, safely, 7/24, anywhere in the world.
As we all know banks do not work on weekends, so if you want to make a transfer on Saturday, you have to wait
until Monday for it to arrive, not even taking the multi-day holidays into account. The answer to this challenge are
e-wallets. E-wallets provide the sufficient accounting systems and related infrastructure for flawless money-transfer.
Original study: here
Infrastructure: e-Wallets are easy and secure to use, this is the fastest growing payment method in the world and
it’s increasingly popular across all sectors. Consumers can either use stored value or take funds from a payment type
linked to their e-Wallet, giving them choice and convenience.
Mediums of exchange: The coins and tokens that are included in the e-wallets will maintain the many attributes of
conventional payment assets (Fiat money)

-                                                                                                                        Payment systems of multinational companies (GooglePay, ApplePay, Wechat Pay, Alipay, (Facebook pay)),
-                                                                                                                        Fintech startups’ payment systems (Paypal, Transferwise, N26, Revolut, ….),
-                                                                                                                        and of course here is the promising opportunity: the blockchain-based cryptocurrency protocols with all
functions of the money and it’s e-wallet interfaces

Three scenario of the Blockchain technology
The solutions and advantages that blockchain provides are recognised by the biggest companies. Blockchain brought
a revolution of digital asset transfers. Anyone can transfer assets using blockchain at any given time, swiftly and for
a very low cost. It makes sending, receiving and storing assets possible on a simple device without the involvement
of a third party.
Blockchain-related developments are evolving in three directions.
Data digitisation: Data storage, authentification, identification and asset digitalisation. Where the given “asset”
doesn’t have an actual value. It just “represents” a given information in a digital format (e.g. vehicle registration,
mail tracking, personal data storage, etc).
Investments: primarily securities, new way of fundraising (ICO-s), coin exchange trading, speculative assets, high
risk and volatile product (The current coin/token market (85+% of the currently available coins or tokens are or will
become such a product). The stored asset is self-sufficient, marketable and has a market value.
Its value is determined by market supply and demand. Its usability and manageability is not a major consideration.
Storage, however, constitutes a high risk. Such products are primarily used for investment, speculation, the ability to
pay and their use is a secondary aspect.
Payments: alternative payment asset with price stabilization system. It is a medium of exchange. In order to achieve
mainstream adoption the payment asset has to have a predictable value. Value is generally adjusted to one of the
global currencies (USD, EUR and other fiat money).  Furthermore, it is an extremely important feature that it should
be easy to use. These products are mainly created for transfers and daily usage. Speculative and investment usage is
not typical.
(The payment also includes fixed-value internal settlement units (e.g.: local money), point collectors, utility, bounty,
club points, coupons etc...)
It is obvious that the “alternative” payment assets and solutions are able to take up a large percentage of the market
even in a short time span. These solutions no longer need to be backed by a government or banks. In some cases they
are backed by companies, communities and organisations. A measurable fraction of this new payment system market
will be taken up by stablecoins because they are capable of functioning as traditional money.
What does it mean “Stablecoin”?
“A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to another stable asset, like gold or the U.S. dollar. It’s a currency
that is global, but is not tied to a central bank and has low volatility. This allows for practical usage of using
cryptocurrency like paying for things every single day.”

Who chooses the stablecoins?
You keep your payment asset on your own account (public key). You can make a transfer regardless of your e-Wallet
provider. Currently the technology is mainly usable online but given the technology’s rate of development, payments
in offline stores can be expected in the next couple of years.
Advantages of transferring via blockchain:
-                                                                                                                     The transactions are unfalsifiable

2.2. How the stabilization system works (backing methods)
In order for stablecoins to maintain their stability a system or a method needs to be applied.  By that we mean that if
there is no demand for the payment asset then the issuer will repurchase it from the backed collateral provided by the
system at a pre-fixed price. If there is no such system or it is used incorrectly, then the price will be determined by
speculations of the whales, which leads to extreme volatility even in the short term. The system must ensure that the
issuer is able to repurchase the total amount of coin issuance at a pre-fixed exchange rate even in the short term. The
rate of issuance by the blockchain accountant device and the system that ensures that the price is stable requires
substantial economic knowledge.
The successful stablecoin projects are more like a Fintech startup company than a fully decentralized system. The
primary reason for this is that individual interests do not prioritise the interest of the community. Hence, without an
adequate system in place the value of stablecoins can be very volatile.
In the case of independent projects, there are currently 5 types of solutions for exchange rate stability.
Fiat-backed: The most convenient solution is that every coin purchased it is backed by an actual US Dollar or Euro
on a bank account. This FIAT backing can only be used to repurchase previously issued coins. In this the involvement
of a third party (bank, escrow) is inevitable.
Crypto backed:  When a stable cryptocurrency is collateralized by other liquid cryptocurrencies or a cryptocurrency
portfolio it can be a great solution to strengthen decentralization. The biggest drawback is that the collateral is very
volatile. Hence it requires the system to implement multiple safeguards. Meaning that 1 USD worth of issued coins
should be backed by at least 2 USD worth of cryptocurrencies that can only be used to repurchase previously issued
coins. This can be solved by using smart contracts or escrow handlers.
Other asset backed: In this case the issued payment assets are not backed by other payment assets. Instead, they are
backed by securities, stocks, government bonds or even gold. This is a great method to ensure stability but we must
be borne in mind that these assets are not as liquid. The portfolio to be hedged must be continuously evaluated for
market capitalisation and coin issuance is only possible with that value in mind.
Community  and/or  algorithmic  backed:  Complete  decentralization  can  be  achieved  if  the  community  is
responsible for coin issuance and coin price based on a previously agreed system or algorithm. Corion Foundation
made a Smart Contract based attempt earlier to achieve a stable price payment asset using this method. There is a
risk that users of short-term interest and speculative behavior will act against the interests of the community, thus
exacerbating stability
Hybrid: It can significantly reduce risks if a stablecoin is backed by the “hybrid” method. This means that the hedge
is made up of multiple items as stated above. This gives the system room for maneuvering and provides extended
security. As the payment asset becomes more and more adopted it allows the system to extend the portfolio with less
liquid assets such as real estate funds or hedge funds.
Each of these solutions can be found on the market in order to achieve stability.
Easy adoption and usage is absolutely key in the mainstream adoption of stable price payment assets. Decentralization
means that the system can operate without the involvement of a third party although it significantly complicates
usability. So at the current levels of technology we believe that the general adoption of decentralised stablecoins are
highly unlikely.
Easy usage is followed by security, cost and speed.
There are newer and better solutions emerging everyday to support the ease of use (e.g.: new exchange, merchant
gateway, swap, e-wallet, private key storage, platforms).

3.2 CorionPay stablecoin (start in 2019)
Based on our experience Corion Foundation is working on its own stablecoin (working title: CorionPay). Expected
to launch in 2019.
Our self-developed wallet, swap and merchant gateway ensures that the payment is quick and easy to use. We are
paying close attention to the regulatory (e-money license), privacy (GDPR) and hedge fund portfolio management
rules. The payment system will be implemented in a registered Fintech company. The coin will be an Ethereum-
based ERC20 token in the beginning and developing our own blockchain is one of our key mid-term goals. The
stability of the Corion Pay’s value will be ensured by a “Hybrid” system. This means that the value of every coin
will be 1 USD and after every emitted coin the equivalent amount will be placed in an Asset management escrow or
bank account built up from “Hybrid” assets. Only then will the coin enter into circulation.
The building up of the “hybrid” asset portfolio that ensures the backing of CorionPay (plan):
10




When creating the hybrid portfolio to back CorionPay the following criteria are taken into consideration: Low
volatility, quick liquidation opportunity so it can be swiftly used to repurchase previously emitted coins. We do not
aim to create inflation and/or deflationary systems with this currency, our aim is to achieve constant liquidity
management and stability. The proposed backing method aims to achieve at least 100% backing and while providing
independence from assets and providers. The issuance of the payment asset will be done at a fintech company. They
will be responsible for the management of the backing at launch. As the currency grows and is integrated into the
world of payments, its scope will be divided increasingly between various assets. The backing package will include
various crypto assets as well as the CorionX token, given that these assets can generate a sufficient daily demand and
market cap. The motive behind that is that crypto users can easily and instantly trade CorionPay using our self-
developed swap system. CorionX users will get significant discounts when using CorionPay and other related
services.
The infrastructure behind CorionPay (e-wallet, merchant gateway, swap) is developed specifically in a way that other
valid stablecoins can be integrated with ease, by strengthening and assisting the expansion of stablecoins. The Corion
Foundation plays an active role in this.

4.1. Corion Foundation
Corion Foundation is a Swiss-based foundation founded in 2016.
It was created with the aim of helping the development and expansion of stablecoins in the world.
4.2. Foundation mission
The need for blockchain-based stable price payment asset (stablecoins) has been demonstrated in the section on
market information. Most of the payment assets are only functioning as intermediaries on several above exchanges.
With our activity, we are helping to increase the adoption of payment assets in everyday life with the use of our
infrastructures. CorionX utility token is functioning as an incentive for the usage of stablecoins.
Our aim is to encourage world-wide adoption of the stablecoins. To help unbanked, young people gain access to
swift, safe and cheap banking. We support projects that are working on such developments in gaining new clients,
contacts and infrastructure. Corion Foundation aims to create a common platform for such projects, as their universal
adoption is what all of us are looking for. We are determined and will do everything possible to make stablecoins
available in most e-wallets, hence making them accessible in more and more regions of the world. This helps users,
to have access to stable pay-per-click, crypto payments, regardless of what wallet they use.
The Foundation will finance its ongoing activities from previous donations, new donations, the result of its asset
management and income made from its activities in a non-profit way. Its audited report is prepared under Swiss law.

4.4. What kind of infrastructure is the Foundation building for stablecoins?
Usability is one of the most important aspects of the mainstream adoption of stablecoins. Sadly we cannot accept the
masses to store their own private key safely or to run nodes on their computer. Stablecoins can only really be accepted,
if they are at least as easy to use the more conventional ways of money keeping (e.g. online banks) Thus, in the case
of cryptocurrencies for day-to-day purchasing (non-speculative or stock market trading), it is indispensable for third-
party service providers to intervene.
We aim to make all stablecoins accessible on our platform if they are deemed valid by our group of experts. Giving
the possibility to all users to store, transfer and buy these assets on the same platform. With it’s operations Corion
Foundation is set to support the creation of a Fintech company that support stablecoins and is capable of creating an
infrastructure that complies with all relevant regulations and data protection laws.

5.1. Opportunity in stablecoin industry
Unquestionably, a new category of currency was created by stablecoins. Those that are working with it or are thinking
about it are really at an early stage. Whoever deals with this, invests time, money, and energy into it, expects multiple
return, because in just a few years hundreds of millions of people will use this payment tool everyday! So, there is a
significant chance that stablecoins will become the dominant player in the market in the near future. The outstanding
players in the payment industry - Peter Thiel (PayPal), Coinbase, IBM - have already recognized this and have
stepped up and involved important resources in stablecoin projects.
Stable price payment platforms are not just serving as potential, popular use cases, but opening great business
opportunities in the fast growing Fintech industry.   Everybody has the opportunity to participate in the game of the
stable price payment assets and become one of it’s users to take the benefit in everyday transactions

6.5. Conclusion
This document is intended to draw attention to the fact that the development of alternative payment instruments is
unstoppable. Within this industry stablecoins will also represent a significant market rapidly.
Anyone who is in the early stages of this financial transition can gain a significant market advantage. At the time of
this document, at least 45 projects are known on the international market that have set up a "stablecoin”. (in 2016
this number was only 5)
For this reason, the Corion Foundation is a pioneer in its ability to simplify the day-to-day financial activities of tens
or even hundreds of millions of people. The Foundation is working to create an infrastructure that makes stablecoins
more useful in everyday life.
Through CorionX utility tokens issued by the Foundation, we help projects that believe in this mission and take a
pioneering role. With appropriate risk assessment and engagement, we encourage everyone to take part in the
spreading and everyday use of "stablecoins".
6.6. Risk disclosure
The significant expansion of alternative payments requires the combination of several factors.
The spread of smartphones, NFC technology, fintech start ups, more opened regulatory environment, a positive
outlook in the in the world economy will further contribute to growth of the crypto industry. Compared to alternative
payments, blockchain-based solutions constitute outstanding opportunities.
Blockchain technology, however has a history of just 1 decade, its broader popularity is only a few years old.
The world of decentralized payment assets is not or hardly understood by the regulatory environment.
Over the last six months, there is a strong market cleansing and a positive attitude of regulators and institutional
representatives.
Great opportunity, but also risk! And this must be known to every stablecoin user. User of any coin, token
(including CorionX utility token), uses this type of payment asset on their own responsibility and risk.
The total loss, neglect, and ban on the use of such payments is currently a real danger.
A multitude of market players need to be able to create long-term value and reduce the risk of using it (eg, nation-
states, banks, escrows, investors, acceptor sites, cryptographic exchanges and, of course, broad masses of users).
This Whitepaper is not considered an investment or business advice.
