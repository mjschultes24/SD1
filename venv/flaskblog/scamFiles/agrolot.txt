Introduction
According to the experts, the agricultural industry accounts for
approximately 25% of the global GDP, with the tendency to top that
number in the near future. Judging by the output value and the volume
of the investments it attracts, the agricultural industry ranks the first
among the wide variety of macro-economic fields in the developed
world.
The capacity of the trade in the world today is expected to grow
intensely in the next 10 years. Therefore, the trade impact would result
in an increased level of food security.
Globalization did not leave the agrarian industry untouched. The market
is very wide that it allows diverse levels of traders. As a result attracting
customers from all corners of the world; however there is an
overwhelming risk of losing finances.

Introduction
It is possible to achieve direct trade. However, small and medium
sized businessmen are faced with various challenges:
Observance of the International Law on trade;
Experienced personnel should take part including; international
economists and attorneys;
Intermediaries with high buying prices;
The capacity to produce is low that would pave way for high levels of
producing and supplying to foreign markets;
Bureaucracy does not pave way for quick sales.
The buying price at the global level depends highly on a number of
factors. It includes; the farmers, food companies and finally consumers.

Introduction
We have made a decision to assist producers to connect with buyers
independently from other a variety of countries; thus enabling them to
avoid unsuitable conditions of cooperating with a vast number of
intermediaries; international traders and brokers.
We made AGROLOT!
About AGROLOT
AGROLOT is an international B2B trading platform in agriculture
and food production
Registered sellers and consumers can conclude gluesome
contracts, exchange transactions, share information and track the
difference in food prices globally.
The internal cryptocurrency of the platform — OFIR (Operative Food
International Registration) backs up the smart contract technology. The
coin will be the means of settlement among subscribers. Every product
will be placed under a category within the register and evaluated in OFIR.

About AGROLOT
The OFIR coin will be in connection with the USD 1 OFIR equivalent to 10 US
dollars.
The OFIR will be sold only internally. It will be exchanged in exchange
of points. The coins may purchase for cryptocurrencies or flat money.1
It was our decision not to sell the OFIR coins externally that would avoid
manipulation of prices. Other oncoming projects may use the coin.
The traditional scheme of selling agricultural products:

How the platform works?
1.                                                                                                                    The user will register at Agrolot.com. Here they get access to the
registry of both producers and buyers of food products.
2.  The buyer will buy the OFIR through the platform official exchanger.
While finding the conducive quality and offer; he signs a smart
contract for the purchase of products by the seller.
3.  AGROLOT.com begins processing the transaction by communicating
to the logistics partners that would guarantee the transaction and
arrange delivery of goods.
4. The cryptocurrency remains frozen until the buyer receives the goods.
5.  The cryptocurrency is then unfrozen as soon as the seller withdraws
the money  earned as a result of online exchange point or the official
Agrolot.com exchange services.
Each buyer and seller will have their own electronic digital signature
(EDS) that will be used for signing the smart contracts after conclusion.
We have conducted a study on the financial and  PEST risks 2 . Through
this the finance structure was created and all expenses calculated. We
also had specific emphasis on the reliability of the structure and capital
safety for investors.

PEST analysis is a marketing tool designed to identify political, economic, social and technological aspects of the
external environment.

How the platform works?
Guarantees and safety
The experience we have allows us to carefully consider the guarantee
for users and their safety.
The AGROLOT platform will be reliably under protection by modern tools
of security.
Prior to launching the system the whole structure of security will
undergo a thorough security check up that will be conducted by an
independent audit company.
Every financial transaction are secured with real goods, such as food
stuffs. In such a case our internal OFIR cryptocurrency becomes a
payment instrument of the AGROLOT platform.
10                                                                       /26




Guarantees and safety
The data provided by our users and the entire system will be stored on
reliable Amazon EC2 and S3 servers. It will ensure the greater level of
protection against DDOs attacks and diverse risks. The servers at various
parts of the world such as (Singapore, USA, Germany, Switzerland and
Holland) will ensure the blockchain operation.
It is our responsibility to deliver goods and we will work only with the
world’s most reliable international logistics companies.
We created the AGROLOT platform (www.agrolot.com) for our own
funds and started our work.
We will make an agrooholding with a land bank a total of 50,000
hectares of land with the intention to cultivation, storage and
processing of most crops in the market. They include: sunflower, maize,
and wheat. These will a guarantee of large quantities and complete
deliveries.
The planned area is at the South of Ukraine: Zaporozhye, Kirovograd,
Odessa, Kherson and Mykolaiv Oblasts. The price of the land on average
is around USD 2500 per hectare
We will create a vertically
integrated agroholding.
In this case we will redeem the property rights of the agricultural
enterprises in existence along with their infrastructure, equipment
and leased land for independent cultivation of agricultural products
and consequently sale through the AGROLOT platform.

Guarantees and safety
The process of buying out of an agricultural enterprise:
Searching for a facility,
Audit of the facility,
Review and discussion with investors (token holders),
Sale of the number of tokens required for the repurchase of the facility
on the internal exchange, and
Repurchasing and commissioning of the facility.
Agricultural holding vertically integrated will be created for
improvement of the volume of trades on our platform. Additionally it
will enhance additional income for the company and investors
We plan to complete the holding by 2020.
Why Ukraine?
Agriculture is one of the biggest industries in economy of Ukraine
because of its favourable climatic and geological conditions. The
world’s third largest exporter of corn is Ukraine and fifth in wheat.
42 million hectares of land are used for agricultural activities. Close to
80% of land involved in cultivation is arable land, two-thirds being fertile
chernozem.
Ukraine has the lowest agricultural investments in Europe but
consequently has the great potential. It is so by observing the great
fertility of soils and undiscovered agroecological potential of the lands.
12                                                                             /26




Why Ukraine?
The country has among the lowest agricultural optimal investments in
the world with $400-800 in every hectare as compared to $4000 in the
USA and $12000 on the Western Europe level.
Ukraine is the owner of ¼ of world’s chernozem.
Treating the chernozem properly provides great harvest and is known
to be the best agricultural land.
Another good reason is that Ukraine contains semi-skilled educated
and cheap labor.
As per the Institute of Agrarian Economics of Ukraine; in 2016 the
Ukrainian agribusiness obtained direct investments of $ 2.47 billion.
Elevators, transhipment terminals, whole logistics complexes are
regions that international traders entering the Ukrainian market
actively work.
In the past years, Bunge ($180 million), Cofco ($75million), Risoil S.A
($70 million) and Allseeds ($200 million) terminals have been created
in the ports of Ukraine.
Loius Dreyfus Ukraine in the largest foreign exporter of grain in
conjunction with “Brooklyn-Kiev” is implementing a project worth
$100 to build a grain terminal.
13                                                                        /26




Why Ukraine?
In the year 2016, the Cargill Corporation introduced a project that would
build a great terminalin the Yuzhniy port of Odessa Oblast. The project
would amount to $150 million.
In addition the NCH agricultural holding company operates in Ukraine
in2015 a total $36 million, the seed plant of the American Dupont
Pioneers operates successfully a 2013 investment worth$51 million.
Foreign investors and international financial institutions are
concentrating on the prospects present in the sector of agriculture. A
good example is the ERBD plans for the year 2018 that would invest
150-200 million euros in the Ukranian agro-industrial complex. The
same figures are used by representatives of the International Finance
Corporation
AGRO-EFFICIENCY
The economic capability of the agroholdings in Ukraine is growing
continuously:
14                                                                          /26




ICO (Initial Coin Offering)
AGROLOT (AGLT) is a token based on the Ethereum ERC20 standard.
We will issue 100 million AGLT tokens.
34,75 million tokens will participate in the ICO:
2 million will be sold during the Private sale;
3 million will be sold during the Pre sale;
20 million will be sold in 4 periods of ICO sales.
9,75 million will be distributed as bonuses and airdrop.
The remaining 65.25 million tokens will be frozen in the following ways; 45.25
million for 3 months from the ICO start for the VIA fund (vertically integrated
agroholding fund), and  20 million tokens  - for the Agrolot founders for  6
months.
The AGLT tokens will be sold on the internal exchange to ensure control over
large fluctuations in exchange rates.
In order to continue developing the project, we intend to begin a
crowdfunding campaign; that would issue AGLT tokens; that operate on
the Ethereum ERC20 standard, and in fact will be the company’s shares.

Financial Indicators
We have calculated the amount of investments needed in the 2-year
period for the project launch and development.
We in turn plan to receive from the sale of the tokens. The calculation is
as follows:
Software development and purchase of the necessary IT equipment-
$4,000,000;
Advertising budget - $2,800,000;
Start-up costs and operating expenses before the payback:
1st year - $1,600,000;
2nd year - $1,600,000.
Operational fund to cover the cash gap on mutual settlements under
smart contracts - $10,000,000
18                                                                           /26




Financial Indicators
The required investments to create a vertically integrated agrarian
holding - $125,000,000. This figure takes into account the factors of
agriculture, namely, seasonality, productivity, the necessary investment
costs by the Ukraine regions.
Total required amount of investments is $145,000,000.
We have defined 2 directions of generating profit for dividend payment.
1. The financial result from the operation of the agrolot.com platform:
The revenue part of this direction will be formed from the fees of the
platform, operations on the exchange, as well as additional operations
planned to be implemented with the development of this direction.
The operating expenses include employee salaries and taxes on wages,
office rent and office costs, IT development, legal costs.
We plan to implement the following organizational structure to start the
project and serve the AGROLOT platform in the future:
19                                                                         /26

Financial Indicators
2. The financial result from the functioning of vertically integrated
agroholding
When calculating the profit from the management of a vertically
integrated company with a land bank of 50,000 hectares, we used
the average net profit on Ukrainian agroholdings for 2016/2017
marketing
year of $500 per 1 ha. Proceeding from this, the net profit per year was
$32.5 million.
From the evaluation of the financial results of the project, it follows that
the breakeven point will be reached by the 3rd year of the Agrolot
project operation.
21                                                                             /26




Investment advantages of
the token holders
The investors will receive relevant dividends proportionally to the number
of owned tokens.
The dividends will be formed from:
profit of Agrolot platform;
increase in the token price;
profits from the vertically integrated agroholding.
After the financial audit for the reporting period, the dividends will be
distributed to the token holders to their wallets.
Registration and airdrop
Airdrop is the advertising system of our project.
We will allocate about 1 million tokens to encourage the registration of
users in our system. We give them to the members who will subscribe
to our social networks and YouTube channels, write reviews about us,
advertise us on their channels.
The first 5,000 users who will register on agrolot.io will receive 10
tokens each, and the next 5,000 will receive 5 tokens each.
We will give tokens as presents for certain actions in social networks.
The full list of actions and incentives within Airdrop will be available on
agrolot.io.
For the review of our project on YouTube channels with 5,000
+ subscribers, we will give 200 AGROLOT tokens.
