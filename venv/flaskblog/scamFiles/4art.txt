"Art is culture and this part of
our identity, but art is
also passion, a good commercial and
object of desire, investment and
currency. Art is so much
and yet something
different for everyone - only one
thing we all have in common
is the desire
to protect this asset and its values".

Restoration
and the receiver.
Restoration  of  artwork  requires  a  “certificate  of
restoration.” This certificate is generated when a re-
storer  restores  an  artwork.  This  certificate  requires
two users: the restorer and the user who commissions
them. Once a certificate of restoration is issued, the
4ART system requests the updated fingerprint.
Change of ownership
Change of ownership requires certificate of own-
ership. This certificate is generated when a user sells
an artwork to another user. This certificate requires
two users and verification of the artwork’s fingerprint.
Once this certificate is issued, ownership of the art
object is also changed in the 4ART system.
Lending
Lending  service  requires  two  certificates,  i.e.  a
certificate of good condition and certificate of posses-
sion. Certificate of good condition is issued when a
user hands over the artwork to a recipient; hence, this
certificate  requires  two  users  and  a  fingerprint.  On
the other hand, a certificate of possession is generat-
ed when an art object is transferred to another user.
Certificate of possession is directional, meaning that
when a user lends out an artwork, it is directed from
owner to borrower. When the art object is returned, it
is directed from borrower to owner. Lending service
generates four certificates during its lifespan.

4ART coin
The 4ART ecosystem will have a 4ART payment token (4ART Coin) and a 4ART utility
token  (4ART  Token).  The  4ART  payment  token  should  establish  itself  as  a  generally
accepted  means  of  payment  in  the  art  world.  4ART  intends  to  build  a  network  of  art
partners that will accept the  4ART payment token as a means of payment. The  4ART
payment  token  is  also  to  be  traded  on  crypto  exchanges  in  order  to  increase  the
awareness  and  distribution  and  to  reach  the  widest  possible  audience.  However,
cryptocurrencies  are  also  subject  to  speculation  and  are  subject  to  significant  price
fluctuations.  To  avoid  such  unwanted  price  fluctuation  effects  on                           4ART's  operating
business and future 4ART service customers, a second 4ART token is created. The 4ART
utility  token  can  be  purchased  using  the  4ART  payment  token  and  various  FIAT  and
cryptocurrencies on the 4ART platform. However, the 4ART utility token is non-tradable
and non-transferable (to exclude speculative effects) and is intended solely to service the
4ART  platform.  In  order  to  promote  the  dissemination  of  the  4ART  payment  token,  a
discount should be granted to users who use this means of payment to purchase 4ART
tokens.
The  new  blockchain-based  ecosystem  for  the  art  world  should  address  the  widest
possible  circle  of  people                                                                        (e.g.  buyers  and  sellers  of  artworks,  artists,  or  dealers
worldwide) with the model of two tokens, while still ensuring stability for those using the
services of 4ART.

of the individual markets is planned and what growth is expected in the individual segments
and regions of 4ARTechnologies.

LET'S DO THIS
We’re honored to be able to count on the support and counsel of artists such as Stefan A.
Wengen, VOKA and Dieter Blum as well as the world’s leading arts logistics and insurance
companies, galleries and museums, investors and collectors in our vast network. Together,
and with a capable tech team by our side, we’re ready to change the face of the industry.
Not least, we’re also hoping to create exciting opportunities for those not yet in the art world -
for potential buyers who haven’t yet considered art or found the market too forbidding as
much as for all of those who are, quite simply, curious. In art, there is so much to discover.
We are delighted to help preserve it for generations to come.
