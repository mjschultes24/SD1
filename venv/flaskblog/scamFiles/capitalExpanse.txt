What is CAPX coin?
"A Decentralized Cash Flow system for the masses"
CapX coin is an ambitious cryptocurrency built and powered by the
blockchain. Our aim is simple, we want to bring crypto to the masses by offering
value in a user-friendly environment. We are not here to re-invent the
blockchain, we simply want to make it easily accessible and user friendly for the
masses. The technology behind blockchain represents endless opportunity,
however, we believe the true value of blockchain lies in what it can offer to the
everyday person that will bring interest and mass adoption.
The current driving force for many in the crypto space is based on the belief
that one day it could become the one world currency for all transactions private
and public. While we do ﬁnd some truth in this notion. Our approach is less
conventional; We believe that for the vast majority cryptocurrency will
represent a store of value, a payment processor, and a method for seamlessy
generating passive income streams privately and securely.

What is CAPX coin?

cont

Welcome to the new frontier
We are in the midst of a digital revolution in ﬁnance, one in which ﬁnancial
governance has been returned to the people. A true global democracy achieved
through the blockchain framework.
Our hope is to eliminate the intimidation layer that keeps most people from
investing into cryptocurrency. No one should feel as though they need to be a
blockchain expert just to participate in an oppurtunity as exciting as this. With
the emergence of any new revolutionary concept, somoene will come along and
simplify the process, thus ultimately setting the industry standard; Apple,
Google, and Facebook are all great examples.
The CapX coin will serve as the conduit for generating cash ﬂow within the
Capital Expanse platform. CapX will be one of the few coins to offer a mobile
miner. Our mobile mining and lending program will work in conjunction with
each other and will offer a robust set of rewards and incentives, including a fully
Gamiﬁed Mining and Lending Program. Please continue reading to learn more!

Whitepaper 1.0
December 2017

We understand that mobile mining is going to be one of the
key beneﬁts and features of any crypto currency in the near
future and also a driving force in mass adoption. We also
understand that the difﬁculty in mining increases at a rapid
rate when a coin becomes "over mined." Currently there are
projects developing mobile mining for their coin, however,
this is mainly still a concept in it's infancy, and curently
offers no substantial value due to the weak power load that
mobile devices are capable of producing, and an ever
increasing mining difﬁculty.
We want to be able to make the experience of mining from
your phone exciting and worthwhile. Our top priority is to
ﬁnd a solution to limit large scale- high output ASIC mining
operations from overmining and raising difﬁculty on the
CapX network. We are aiming for the coin to be mined
predominantly by mobile devices. The goal is to keep the
playing ﬁeld fair for all miners. We are currently developing
our mobile mining application for android and iOS and will
be launching it over the coming months of 2018, please
refer to our Roadmap. The CapX project aims to be robust
and on going development that will offer many exciting
features such as this with each milestone.

Afﬁliates/Partners
We hope to expand our reach through the use of an afﬁliate or partner
program. These programs are an invaluable tool in the modern age for
spreading CapX. We understand the importance of afﬁliates and offer a
generous program for those interested.

Development Team
Our development team is comprised of a group of bright young minds with a
shared focus of thinking out side the box and a passion for crypto currency.
Currently, the concept of crypto currency investing is incredibly convoluted to
the average person who doesn't know much about the space. There is a
plethora of complex terminology accompanied by an overly technical buying
process that tends to thwart interest from the start.
We aren't doing the norm; our focus is to create an extraordinarily yet simple
and userfriendly ecosystem for cashﬂow and passive income that is easy to
grasp from the very ﬁrst encounter.
Marketing:
A portion of the ICO funds raised will go to marketing CapX to the masses by
way of social media, Ad Campaigns, and Sponsored events.
