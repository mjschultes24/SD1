INTRODUCTION
Cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based technologies have the potential to transform the real estate industry.
This paper outlines a vision for a new crypto-currency, a trading platform and software applications for the real
estate industry based on state of the art blockchain technology. This vision was created by the REGO team
which consists of experienced real estate investors, professionals and technologists who plan to revolutionize the
industry.
REGO stands for “Real Estate To Go” which alludes to the ease of conducting real estate transactions with
blockchain technology based property trading platform and applications. Such technologies will make the buying,
selling, management and development of real estate properties more efficient, secure and with lower costs.
This document focuses on a general overview of the proposed technology and its uses.
