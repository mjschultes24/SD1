RIGOBLOCK:  A  PROTOCOL  FOR  DECENTRALIZED  FUND  INFRASTRUCTURE
THE  NEW  PARADIGM  FOR  ASSET  MANAGERS
MR. GABRIELE RIGO

Abstract.  The asset management industry is dominated by fund distribution networks and big players.  It is difficult
and cumbersome for emerging managers to startup their own fund unless they have many years of experience, assets
from investors and proprietary money.  Yet big hedge funds scout for talent and delegate risk to very young professionals,
targeting exceptional returns by exploiting the most recent research and data analysis techniques.  Light operational
structures exist (managed accounts) but they are burdensome to manage, require wasting a lot of time managing and
rebalancing the portfolios.
Blockchain provides the ideal technology for setting up funds in a short period of time, with low setup costs and with
innovations of processes which could only be imagined before.  We provide the technological framework for emerging
managers to set up their own investment vehicle.  We discuss its design, vision of implementation and Proof-of-Concepts,
the opportunities it provides in giving more transparency, efficiency to operations and innovating processes.  We also
propose an alternative paradigm for rewarding talent and hard work.

the data directly from the blockchain, therefore without
requiring any friction or intermediary.  The world-famous
American financial journalist and trader Jack D. Schwa-
ger has recently launched a startup for performing these
calculations and audits on traders’ traditional managed
accounts, as a proof of need of such product.                                                                  6.1.  A  New  Way  Of  Aligning  Interests.  What  we
propose  is  a  radical  change  in  the  way  performance  is
rewarded,  whose reason behind is twofold:  on one side,
we aim at improving the quality of management; on the
other side, while the calculation of management and per-
formance  fees  on-chain  can  result  expensive,  our  model
exploits  one  key  characteristic  of  blockchain  technology
which makes it ultra-easy to calculate a fee per each trans-
action  and  automatically  allocate  it  to  the  correct  ac-
count without need of manual reconciliation or settlement.
Rather  than  a  management  and  performance  fee  being
charged to the fund directly, our protocol has no fees, and
managers get rewarded in Rigo tokens thanks to an algo-
rithm called Proof-of-Performance, which is built on top
of the protocol.  The Proof-of-Performance module com-
putes the assets and the performance of a fund for each
sub-period and rewards the traders, on a quarterly basis,
based on those two factors.  At the end of each period, a
trader can claim her reward.  The Proof-of-Performance
algorithm’s parameters are set by the Rigo token holders,
so that they can decide on the fair reward ratio.
6.2.  Distribution.  A further way to create an ecosystem
for funds is the concept of distribution:  third-party plat-
forms can leverage our module Distribution, or create their
own one on top of our protocol, and set a per-transaction
fee, which is to be set and modified arbitrarily by the dis-
tributor, but publicly available. The distributor therefore
transparently sets her own fees in a competitive market.
While  normally  the  use  of  this  type  of  fee  is  prone  to
manual errors (either calculation or settlement), through
the use of blockchain, this is performed automatically and
seamlessly. The amount of work for a traditional manage-
ment company for such operations makes this procedure
today very expensive to execute.
                                                                                                               6.3.  Excessive  Risk  Taking.  Excessive  risk  taking  is

smart contract.  With our approach, no matter what, the
client is always in control of her assets. Furthermore, since
the code is deployed on-chain, no matter what happens to
the company running the platform, the code will always
allow the owner of some tokens to redeem them for Ether,
thus resulting fraud and censorship proof. By design, our
product becomes the technology layer which can be po-
tentially used by services like Xapo  (i.e.  cryptocurrency
wallets) for offering safe Ether hot-storage and at the same
time allowing for key cold-storage:  keys can be off-chain,
but at the same time a user can query the blockchain to
visualize in real time the total deposits and for each user.
First hypothesis we relax is the possibility for the manager
to transfer to escrow accounts: they are no more possible;
we prevent any transfer of Ether from within the fund. In
this case the manager cannot even transfer Ether to an
escrow account.  Second hypothesis we relax is NAV esti-
mate. In this case NAV is fixed at 1 Ether per share. Since
the fund only holds Ether, does not have any management
or performance fees, the value of one share will always be
the same.  Now we have a product which one can use to
create her own decentralized pool of tokens, buy tokens in
real time at a known price, sell tokens in real time at a
known price. She can create as many funds as she wants,
thus having an efficient tool for managing her family and
friends or even institutional investments.   She can even
set  a  transaction  fee  each  time  tokens  are  bought,  and
receive it automatically without need to reconcile with a
third party or spend time on calculating fees.  Vault is a
product aimed for anyone looking to securely store Ether
in one place, who have more or less experienced the same
problem:  holding Ether on behalf of others and bearing
all the responsibility for it, plus being able at any time
to access those funds,  as the Ether is bought and held
for  the  long  run.   Vault  is  our  first  product  to  go  live
to the Ethereum mainnet, as it leverages the RigoBlock
protocol and the Proof-of-Performance incentives mech-
anism,  but does not rely on external services being op-
erational  (decentralized  exchanges  or  oracles).   Current
work on our Vaults has been on pre-setting it to interact
with Casper, the next frontier in Ethereum-based mining,
in order to allow for pooled Proof of Stake mining.  Our

9.  RigoBlock Exchange
The RigoBlock Exchange has been built with the pur-
pose of providing a decentralized exchange for the Dragos
to  trade.   It  is  a  completely  decentralized  exchange  for
leveraged cryptoswaps trading.  It allows users to place a
leveraged  (or not) trade on ETHUSD  (just one asset on
the exchange at the moment) both on the long and on the
short side, so that traders can profit if the price goes up
by buying, but also on selling the position short.  A de-
rivative is a contract that represents an asset which does
not exist on the blockchain.  The RigoBlock Exchange is
limited by the challenges all decentralized exchanges face
today (mostly slow execution, aka latency, and gas fees for
unexecuted orders) but it is one of a kind, and we are look-
ing forward to improve it, as we believe that decentralized
exchanges are the new frontier of financial trading.  The
RigoBlock exchange is a long-term project and we are not
looking to put it in production soon, as current work is on
integrating decentralized exchanges with our Dragos.
10.  Proof-of-Performance
Proof-of-Performance is our new paradigm for reward-
ing managers’ performances. As we said before, we disrupt
the traditional concepts of management and performance
fees. Proof-of-Performance allows traders to mine (techni-
cally mint) GRG tokens based on their risk-adjusted per-
formance. The bigger their pool of tokens, the more GRG
tokens they will be entitled to mint.   Managers are re-
quired to hold a minimum amount of GRG tokens in order
to run their own decentralized pool of tokens.  The GRG
token does not hold intrinsic value, is not represented by
any real activity or security, does not bear or entitle to
any dividends or interest is not backed by assets. Its sole
purpose is for allowing reward of performance of traders
and being at the basis of our incentives mechanism.
In particular, activities which might require the status
of  ”accredited”,  ”specialized”, or which might fall under
the scope of regulation, will require users to hold minimum
thresholds of GRG tokens.                                                                                      The above picture is a summary schematic of the Proof-

connected to the protocol.  The RigoBlock Exchange is
reliant on external oracles and will not go in production if
we can find a better decentralized exchange for derivatives.
We are also cooperating for work on decentralized oracles
systems,  which  will  reduce  the  cost  of  maintaining  on-
chain oracles. This is more of an optimization work as we
have built our own oracles and are looking for an efficient
way to provide free prices for everyone. Our ultimate goal,
once our technology is fully operational on the Ethereum
mainnet, is to make the RigoBlock platform an ecosystem
for traders, allowing any investment strategy, no matter
how twisted or strange, be performed.  One of the tools
for creating such ecosystem will be to allow funds invest
into other funds (dedicated fund-of-funds structures) and
build autonomous pools of funds whose task is to invest
in the best trading strategies and be able to more eas-
ily raise from the crowd thanks to its unprecedented level
of diversification.  Such pool-of-pools will have the power
to levy the traders from the burden of regulation as the
RigoBlock pool, in this case, will act as a global traders’
fund with thousands or potentially millions of traders and
bear all regulatory costs, acting as a guarantor.
