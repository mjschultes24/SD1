Abstract
IOVO (Internet Of Value OmniLedger) is a unique global open network
database for storing and exchanging information on any type of quanti-
tative value asset.   IOVO is a directed acyclic graph  (DAG), the next
generation of blockchain, and serves as a data management and scoring
ledger.  It does this by creating a universal global decentralised ledger of
all values and then publishing rating scores for individuals and institutions
across a range of sectors.  Rating scores within IOVO are only accessible
by the entity being scored, and are only revealed as answers to particular
questions. In this way, IOVO acts as a zero-knowledge proof platform.
As a base layer, the IOVO DAG provides the infrastructure for any
decentralized application (dApp) which focuses on value and scoring data
usage in fields such as finance, credit, insurance and non-monetary pay-
ments. IOVO is designed to provide a foundation for decentralized apps.
As a result, most users will not directly use the low-level functionality of
IOVO. Instead, they will use user-friendly dApps created by other net-
work users.  Every dApp developer can create a new scoring along with
the  dApp  or  use  one  or  more  existing  scorings.   Hence,  the  author  of
the dApp decides, which user data will be used for a particular business
purpose and defines the rules for the data access.  Therefore, the actual
functionality of IOVO will be driven by the dApp developers, not by the
creators of IOVO.
IOVO is based on the idea that in every moment of our lives we gen-
erate an enormous amount of data and that the ownership of those quan-
titative values is a crucial element of our future freedom.  This valuable
data (that we generate, store, transfer and share) represents our human
value.  When we are denied access to the ownership of this data we are
robbed of its intrinsic value, and therefore our freedom to decide upon
its usage.  This limits our operational human capital and possibilities to
monetize our human value by different forms of exchange.  IOVO is fo-
cused on returning the ownership of that value back to the individual and
stores it in a safe and secure way.  It democratizes the monetization of
data  expressed as an electronic identity for all participating parties.
IOVO allows users and companies to own their individual data and
decide what is revealed and on what terms via their personal data wallet.
Being the first truly transparent, universal, personal and institutional de-
centralized data space, IOVO serves as a global ledger capable of securing
every type of knowledge-based piece of value relating to both individuals
and entities. It stores and supplies all possible values and scoring features
(protocols) for different market and social applications.  It is encrypted,
secure, distributed, democratic and above all human-centric.  That said,
IOVO has the capability to reach a broader scope than just the storage
and authentication of individual value.  It is a database-network serving
as a base layer for future decentralized value market makers.

In our modern digital world, at any given moment we’re generating an enormous
amount of data. This data is then stored, transferred and shared, often without
our knowledge.  This valuable data represents our human value, and when we
are denied ownership and control over this data we are robbed of its intrinsic
value. This limits our operational human capital and our ability to monetize our
human value via different forms of exchange. The Internet of Value Omniledger
(IOVO) will return ownership of that value back to the individual and store
it in a safe and secure manner.  IOVO democratizes the monetization of data
—expressed as an electronic identity for all participating parties.
Currently, multiple centralized structures take full advantage of the data gener-
ated by users of different platforms and their everyday lives. IOVO remedies this
by providing a decentralized network database that allows users to benefit from
collecting, storing, and sharing their personal value directly or via numerous
decentralized apps (dApps).
IOVO is designed to democratize valuable data ownership, storage and mone-
tization in order to protect human capital asset-value in the light of ongoing
automation of labour and service processes.
The term “omniledger” refers to IOVO’s status as a “ledger of ledgers, a uni-
versal global database network acting as a base layer for different decentralized
social and commercial applications.  As an omniledger, IOVO will become a
growing, secure, and transparent infrastructure for various quantitative value
management platforms and dApps, providing both user empowerment and so-
cial and commercial utility.
1.1                                                                                 The coming of the Internet of Value (IoV)
Technology is exceeding our wildest expectations:  this has brought enormous
benefits, but the rapid pace of change is in danger of spiralling out of control.
Value is shifting aggressively from the material economy of industry, and ser-
vices are being colonized by automation and rapidly developing AI technologies.
Human value is in danger of being undermined.
The emergence of the Internet of Value  (IoV) is both an opportunity and a
challenge for the future of human value, measurable via different methods data
collecting,  scoring and management.  As we witness the rapid growth of in-
dustry and service-based automation across all sectors, the human value rep-
resented by labour and data further loses its significance.  IOVO is a DAG, a
network-database securing complete personal data ownership and management
2




to mitigate against a future of diminishing human value.
It is estimated that by 2025, as much as 70% of all current and future global
markets will rely on blockchain and DAG technology.  IOVO recognizes and
stores human value by accumulating personal data. It makes data an exchange-
able asset secured by the distributed global public ledger.  The tools built on
the IOVO DAG (e.g., dApps) will allow individuals and communities to benefit
from all personal human capital that can be captured by personal data.
Until recently, the Internet facilitated the exchange of information and various
forms of intermediary value —from monetary transactions via mobile banking
to social significance markers in different social media platforms. Social and eco-
nomic exchanges were facilitated by for example money, accompanied by ledgers
- a human invention dating back to when the pace of civilization gained momen-
tum and expanded into its current complex character. With time, the invention
of money detached itself from the original value of human assets and services
and the exchange of commodities, becoming an independent system. This sys-
tem has come to rule our economy, developing subsequent feature instruments
and gaining unprecedented influence over all social and economic processes. As
a result of this process, money has come to wield power over the socioeconomic
global system, and human value has been diminished. Together with the devel-
opment of the information-based economy, data rapidly became the currency of
our times. And as such, it has also become a user-independent system, centrally
governed by multinational organizations and states.
We are entering a new stage in history, one where our entire future as a species
is in the balance. Left unchecked, the rise of the automated machine economy,
machine learning and AI services could dominate all socioeconomic systems.
Instead, IOVO intends to leverage the same technology to serve the exchange
of valued human assets, such as influence, knowledge or time, sustaining human
value and democratizing personally created human capital.  The emergence of
the Internet of Value  —possibly the final element of the global Internet ex-
change network —will allows us to preserve imminent human value at both the
individual and community level.
1.2                                                                                   Data and freedom
The activities of people, businesses, and other entities generate enormous amounts
of data. This value is currently harvested and appropriated by large commercial
organizations. People and institutions no longer own their data, and losing own-
ership of your personal data is tantamount to losing ownership over your life.
Personal data ownership is therefore a cornerstone of a contemporary definition
of freedom.
3




The data we generate is a registry of our lives,  a registry which stores and
reflects our intrinsic human value.  Data encapsulates and demonstrates our
human capital, commonly understood as ones potential. The human value and
capital of every person is stored in the lifetime of data they generate, transfer
and share with others. It is obvious that this value should be attributed to and
owned by the individuals who generate it.  The trend of ceding ownership of
personal digital identity to large organisations limits operational human capital
and the ability for people to monetize their human value via different forms of
exchange.
IOVO is designed to allow individuals and entities to reclaim ownership of their
data. IOVO facilitates and automates the process of personal data management
and monetization. The IOVO DAG provides the infrastructure for any and all
future dApps based on user values and/or focusing on data usage, including
(but by no means limited to) finance, credit, insurance, banking, news, and
non-monetary payments.  IOVOs goal is to democratize the monetization of
data for all participating parties.
1.3                                                                                 The return of human value
Human value is increasingly limited in our super-modern economy.  The un-
precedented technological progress between the mid-20th century and today has
seen a similarly unprecedented rise in the value of material instruments. From
early computers to modern interconnected electronic equipment, technologies
have risen in value and conquered one area of human life after another.  From
early personal computer solutions to the iPhoneX, technology has both facili-
tated our daily lives and intrinsically altered almost every fundamental social
and economic process.
The economy is now run by markets - just as predicted by multiple scholars.
Agriculture and industry have become automated, while the services sector has
been largely democratized. The value of products and processes has thus further
outgrown the value of individuals. We are at a crucial stage of our history and
socio-economic development, one where we now face the urgent need to decide
on our future in an automated world of AI machines.
Universal basic income, a topic which has seen much lively public discussion
recently, is just one example of the dangerously escalating global challenge we
face as a result of diminished human value.  As the Silicon Valley futurist Tim
OReilly has stated:  “Weve forgotten that if we dont pay people, they cant buy
our products;  they cant respond to our ads.   So theres a problem with the
algorithm that were using to run modern businesses.”
This new emergent economy is increasingly referred to as “Industry 4.0”.  The
4




coming period in history will take full advantage of many possible technological
advancements, eventually culminating in the full automatization of all industrial
and most service-centred global economic systems. In this rationale of progress,
human value will further diminish if no tools to assess,  store and exchange
this value are developed and disseminated worldwide. Decentralized ledgers are
perfect for these tasks.  Human assets are progressively deprived of real value
due to the lack of a real and publicly trusted ledger. Anything that is not on a
ledger does not exist - everything that has no underlying ledger, has no value.
The answer to this civilizational challenge lies in the instruments of exchange
that shape the global economy and further limit the significance of human value
within the global economic system.  At this stage in history, we must decide
whether we will develop tools and instruments that allow human value to flourish
or simply ignore the impact of further automation processes that fully divorce
the full spectrum of economic process from human capital and value.   This
value be only represented in a fully transparent data collecting, storage and
management system. The IOVO DAG will provide such a system.
1.4                                                                                   The missing piece of the Internet
The world is a system of human exchange.  The greatest gift the Internet has
brought to the world is making new methods of exchange possible. From early
commodity exchanges and the network of ledgered favour liabilities to mod-
ern capital markets lubricating global economies, exchange has served human
progress and socioeconomic fluidity.  The systems of exchange developed con-
current to the progress of human civilization have become increasingly complex,
to the point where they are in danger of becoming completely detached from
intrinsic human value.
The coming of the Internet of Value will close the global exchange circuit. To-
gether with the “first two Internets (the Internet of Information and the sub-
sequent Internet of Things) the Internet of Value will complete the near-future
Internet of Everything.  Thus, it will become a comprehensive foundation for
the entire global social exchange system. It will not be a parallel reality, but an
indispensable layer of the global socio-economic system.
TTherefore, the Internet of Value will bring about the open trust paradigm,
creating a barrier-destroying direct economic system. IOVO will be the platform
and currency of the Internet of Value;  however it will not bring with it all
the data ownership and monetary burdens of our current system, because all
transactions and liabilities will be recorded and made public. At the very core of
IOVO exists the idea that all data transactions and actions of exchange will be
based on comprehensive personal data ownership and management - for reasons
of privacy, security and monetization.

1.5                                                                                Why is IOVO needed?
Contemporary social and economic reality is increasingly dependent on data.
The flow of data (collection, storage, management, exchange, etc.)  defines the
structures of power in politics and economies.  The centralization of all data-
related processes harms democracy and is the root cause of the current and
future decline in human value.
There are two key reasons why IOVO is so necessary:
•  Large organizations harvest and process the data generated by the activi-
ties of nearly every human on the planet. Individuals have no control over
this, and they have no technical recourse to determine how their data is
used. Data is harvested and monetized while the individuals who generate
that data see no benefits. Once centralized, this personal data is easy for
unauthorized, often hostile entities to appropriate.
•  There is a need for a cumulative universal database that can be easily
browsed  and  analysed.   The  IOVO  DAG  is  a  comprehensive  network
database accessible to analysts and researchers from every conceivable
field.

2.1                                                                                What is IOVO?
IOVO is a DAG  (directed acyclic graph) designed as a platform for various
applications.  IOVO’s primary functions are to collect, store, and secure user
data shared with applications built upon the IOVO DAG. User data cannot be
accessed by other users without the original users consent.  If a user agrees to
share their data, they will receive an agreed fee when that data is accessed.
Users decide precisely how much of their data is made externally accessible to
other parties, while keeping complete control over it.  Every browsing action
and query requires a payment. IOVO serves as a personal data wallet. It builds
a powerful universal database that allows unrestricted analysis opportunities.
IOVO provides the infrastructure to create a new data economy,  one which
allow users to monetize their data and access benefits that were previously only
available to the owners of platforms and applications.

2.2                                                                                 What problems does IOVO solve?
IOVO is a decentralized database ecosystem.  It is dedicated to giving data
ownership and power over data and its monetization to those whose lives gen-
erate it:  people.  IOVO is conceived and designed to secure complete control
over all users’ data and how it is shared. Users decide what gets revealed, who
gets access, and what they want to be paid for it. Users own all their personal
data and any further data derived from it (e.g., scorings).  This makes IOVO
a universal database network infrastructure —a global registry of every kind of
data-related knowledge, as well as a database of all possible scoring scales and
information derived from that knowledge.
IOVO satisfies the following particular needs of different participating parties:
A. USERS.
IOVO gives users ownership and full control over their digital value and privacy,
together with shifting data monetization processes from large data collecting
organizations to the final user. The benefits of IOVO for users include:
1.  Data wallet and access to IOVO network.
2.  Data ownership.
3.  Data security and transparency.
4.  Data monetization.
5.  Anonymity.
7




B. dApp AND APPLICATION OWNERS.
IOVO guarantees full data security to operators of applications and decentral-
ized applications. It also facilitates monetization of this data (with user consent)
and supports user growth by satisfying stringent data security and privacy stan-
dards. The benefits of IOVO to dApp and application owners include:
1.  Access to a comprehensive global database via data wallet.
2.  Monetization of owned data.
3.  Data security.
4.  Acquisition of more users.
5.  Unmodifiable history.
C. COMPANIES AND DATA ANALYSTS.
IOVO is a powerful network database for browsing,  analysis,  and inference.
The infrastructure is comprehensively analysis-friendly and equipped with easy
access to external analytical tools. Researchers and analysts can also use tools
and solutions delivered by IOVO. The benefits of IOVO for companies and data
analysts include:
1.  Big data access to complete network.
2.  Data research and analysis.
3.  Full anonymity.
4.  Direct contact with surveyed users.
5.  Secure data storage and unmodifiable history.
By aggregating all types of personal data generated by users of dApps based
on the DAG, IOVO serves as a complete big data infrastructure capable of
providing answers to complex research and analysis queries.
In addition to addressing particular needs of the parties participating in the
IOVO ecosystem, the IOVO DAG also addresses weak points in current-generation
blockchain and DAG implementations such as scalability, stability, and security.
The many technical benefits of IOVO are found described in the later sections

Figure 2: The IOVO network can aggregate data from every field
of this paper.  These include decentralization of data, secure encryption, own-
ership and control over data, personal data monetization, transaction speed,
Ethereum-like smart contracts and a powerful database network equipped with
internal big data analytical tools.
2.3                                                                                  IOVO as the largest network of data
In addition to providing data protection,  the IOVO  network  functions as a
database, collecting data from all applications built or based upon it. The wide
variety of possible applications and means the IOVO network has the potential
to become the world’s largest database, aggregating data from various fields.
The diversity of data stored within the system will generate significant public
and commercial research potential. Currently, data from different disciplines is
siloed, and separate databases must be used for comparative analyses, incurring
significant costs in terms of both time and resources.
The IOVO network would allow carrying out different case analyses on a multi-
level basis within a single network/database search. It means a huge increase in
analytical capabilities and the quality of conclusions drawn, which in traditional
database approaches had no chance to exist - traditional methods limited access
to certain databases, increasing the cost and time. The IOVO network provides
the chance to change the approach to database analysis to methods that were
not possible or too difficult to conduct within traditional frameworks.
9




As an example, imagine a study into the influence of various factors affecting
the development of a disease, one which takes into currently unanalyzed factors
(e.g., social, personality, etc). The data connection potential is substantial given
the easy access to data and costs. Of course, this ease of access must not come
at the expense of data privacy.  Analyses on the IOVO network only use data
with both user consent and an intrinsic mechanism that allows users to benefit
from their data use in accordance with the idea of IOVO.
2.4                                                                                      The IOVO network and dApps
IOVO is a peer-to-peer network —users can join it at any time and start mak-
ing transactions.  Every user connected to the network acts as a transmitter
of transactions  —they broadcast incoming transactions to other nodes in the
network.  This enables every transaction to reach validators in a fraction of a
second. Validators in turn are responsible for verifying the transactions —they
check every transaction for correctness and run their smart contract code  (if
present).  Validators are incentivized to participate in this verification process
by the network rewards, which are distributed according to IOVO’s proof-of-
value (PoV) consensus algorithm, an extension of proof of stake (PoS).
In a centralized application network there is a central server  (S) and clients
(K ) which communicate with it.   These client devices include smartphones,
tablets, and laptops.  The IOVO DAG is a decentralized application network
system  where  all  users  are  equal.   Therefore  all  connections  are  distributed
evenly between random nodes within the network.  The clients still exist, but
some nodes function as validators (V ).
On top of this network layer, all users can develop and implement decentralized
apps (dApps):
2.5                                                                                      The development of IOVO
In its early stages, the IOVO network will not contain much data —it will take
time to gather information and create valuable ratings.  Therefore, we need to
motivate people to participate in the early stages of IOVO.
When users approve transactions,  they have a chance to mine a coin.   The
expected gain is proportional to the user’s combined value: this is initially equal
to the user’s stake, but smoothly evolves into their value score as IOVO matures
(see Section 3.13).  This mechanism encourages users to increase their rating,
which in turn encourages progress towards more maturity.   As IOVO tends
toward this later stage, mining will become less profitable as most earnings will
10

works
come from providing data and creating new ratings.
This is just a brief overview of the process. For more details, see Section 3.13.
2.6                                                                                   The economics of IOVO
Earning in IOVO is directly connected to the novel concept of proof of value
(PoV). PoV is an evolution of the proof of stake (PoS) approach [8], according to
which each validator is paid for their work in proportion to their stake (i.e., the
amount of money deposited for this purpose).  IOVO also relies on validators;
however, their expected reward is proportional to their combined value.
The combined value consists of two components:  stake and value score.  The
stake plays the same role as in PoS, while the value score reflects how valuable
the user is within the IOVO network.  Every user has a value score which rep-
resents how valuable their ratings and information are to the IOVO community
as a whole.
The stake and value score influence the combined value via different weightings,
which change over time. Initially, the combined value is based mostly on stake;
however, as network usage increases, the value score will become increasingly
important.  Once IOVO reaches a mature stage with many IOVO dApp users,
the stake will be completely replaced by the value score.

2.7                                                                                Examples of IOVO-based applications
The market and social applications of the IOVO DAG are virtually endless, and
can cover all business areas. This is because scorings can be both derived from
different market behaviours and also supply the information necessary to adjust
the terms of goods and services to particular users.
However, the basic market-making opportunities facilitated by the IOVO DAG
are:
ONLINE INFLUENCE-BASED DYNAMIC PRICING
Influnomy is a platform being developed by the IOVO team as the first market-
making proof of concept for the IOVO DAG base layer.  The Influnomy name
refers to “influence economy”, a very old part of the overall economic system,
which thanks to technology is now dynamically expanding, just as social and
sharing economies are. The idea is to facilitate the exchange of personal assets
other than money, starting with social media consumers behavioural influence.
The emergence of the influence economy paradigm has so far over-simplified
the understanding of influence to mean only brand influencing, ignoring the
opportunity for direct exchange of other influence-based non-monetary human
assets.
INSURANCE SCORING SYSTEMS
12




One clear application of IOVO technology is when insurers need to dynamically
adjust pricing based on previously scored consumer behaviours. For example, a
car insurer may want to reprice an individual policy based on previous examples
of good or bad driving. A IOVO dApp would facilitate data collection, storage
and processing,  allowing secure and transparent scoring of users automotive
history and behaviours to indicate their future terms of service. Thanks to the
IOVO DAG and the decentralised browsable data storage structure, insurance
companies will be able to create scorings and reach IOVO users accordingly.
NEWS DAPP: DROPP
Another decentralized application undergoing final development by the IOVO
team is the Dropp News dApp, a decentralised news application with a geo-
graphical focus based on the idea of user-generated content and news.  Dropp
News empowers its users to participate in both local and global news infras-
tructures by uploading news information and imagery linked to particular geo-
graphical locations. Users will be rewarded for their contributions and will help
build a curated multimedia repository of information about various places.
BANKING AND FINANCE SCORING
Once it leaves its earliest stages, the IOVO DAG can be operationally applied to
create secure foundations for a complex banking and transactional processing
infrastructure.  In addition to a decentralized database, banking and finance
institutions need reliable scorings to adjust their offers.  They can also supply
information (e.g., based on the European PSD2 directive) that helps to create
future scorings. The IOVO DAG decentralized encrypted database-network can
supply a comprehensive infrastructure for document processing and all types of
transactional ledgering.
HR:  PROFESSIONAL  AND  COOPERATION  DATA  AND  RAT-
ING
The IOVO DAG can facilitate the establishment of an HR and recruitment plat-
form to handle multiple networking and job offering processes. The IOVO DAG
infrastructure will be useful where institutions and professionals need to choose
external contractors based not only on existing reviews and review systems, but
by deriving scoring ratios from users non-sector scored activities.  Thanks to
IOVO’s zero-knowledge proof facility, IOVO DAG will allow easy and indirect
exchange of data-based characteristics while preserving users’ privacy until they
decide to reveal their identity.
KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE SCORING
Using zero-knowledge proofs,  the IOVO DAG will facilitate information ex-
change that informs societal and consumer decisions on acquiring knowledge
13




and expertise. IOVO DAG will be useful anywhere that participants in knowl-
edge and skill exchange platforms need to base decisions not only on qualitative
reviews but also on reliable scoring ratios derived from a broad range of disci-
plines and activities.
FOOD QUALITY AND DISTRIBUTION SCORING
As a fully operational DAG working as a new blockchain,  IOVO can easily
become a foundation for a solution to a crucial challenge currently facing hu-
manity: food quality. It is easy to imagine a sub-database on the IOVO network
that scores food production and tracks food distribution until it reaches final
consumers in either shops or restaurants.
And these are just a few examples of the myriad of use cases IOVO fulfils. Any
type of data processing and/or scoring-oriented application can be built on top
of the IOVO DAG, including browsers, communicators, e-commerce and other
commercial tools already present on the market, as well as those that will come
to market in the future.

3.1                                                                                 Definitions
IOVO’s high-level value management features are implemented using a highly
effective distributed system of accounts and the transactions carried out between
them.  Therefore, we first describe this underlying transaction system before
covering the main IOVO features built on top of it.
•  Account
Every account is a pair of cryptographic keys:  a public key which serves
as an address and a private key used to sign transactions.  Each IOVO
user can manage several accounts through their wallet.
•  Transaction
The backbone of IOVO is a system of fast and cheap transactions carried
out between accounts. The most basic type of transaction is one where a
user, A, transfers IOVO coins (IOVO’s currency) of value v to a second
user, B. However, more complex transactions are also possible.
•  Standard Transaction
By standard transaction, we mean a transaction which carries some value,
v (measured in IOVO coins), and a short (e.g., 128B) message, m. Since all
14




transactions are public, this message will be visible to the whole network.
Therefore, this can be used as an append-only public ledger. On the other
hand, users can easily use the same feature to send private messages to
other users by encrypting the message with the recipient’s public key.
In this case, only the recipient can decrypt the message, by using their
private key. v can take almost any value, including 0, IOVO can be used
as a platform for fast and cheap1  money transfers and messaging.
•                                                                                           Extended Transaction
In addition to the value, v, and the message, m, every transaction can
have a script attached to it. This script can contain any data and allows
smart contracts to be created and processed between users.  The script
and its data are accessible through the mechanism of scorings, which will
be extensively covered in Section 3.7.
Since extended transaction scripts can run long, these transactions are
much more expensive for the network to handle. Therefore, every extended
transaction has a higher fee.
•                                                                                           Gas
In order to handle extended transactions, we introduce a gas-based fee
system, similar to Ethereum [1]. The difficulty of the extended transaction
is measured in the units of gas which must be “burned” to perform every
virtual machine operation.
•                                                                                           Blockchain
Blockchain is a base layer used in traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin
[2] and Ethereum  [1].   In blockchain,  all transactions are coupled into
blocks which appear on a public ledger at regular time intervals (e.g., in
Bitcoin a new transaction block appears every 10 minutes). Transactions
are verified by the miners who use their computing power to perform some
computation. This verification process is called proof of work (PoW).
•                                                                                           Transaction DAG
Recently, several novel cryptocurrency architectures to supersede blockchain
have been proposed based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).  The two
most common groups are single-transaction DAGs (e.g., Byteball [3] and
IOTA  [4]) and multi-blockchain DAGs  (e.g., BitShares  [5], EOS  [6] and
PolkaDot [7]).
•                                                                                           Scoring
The main building block for managing IOVO user data is the mechanism
of scorings.  Each scoring is a user-generated protocol for collecting and
aggregating user data.  All the rules about what data can be stored and
1
The effective fee for standard transactions will decrease over time as the number of IOVO
users grows. For more information on fees, please refer to Section 3.13.
15




how it can be accessed are published in a special document called the
scoring manifest. The concept of scorings will be covered in greater detail
in Section 3.7.
•                                                                               Scoring Manifest
A scoring manifest is a dedicated document created along with each scor-
ing.  Any user can create a new scoring at any time by publishing its
manifest.
•                                                                               Decentralized Application (dApp)
IOVO is designed to provide the foundation for building decentralized
apps (dApps). As a result, most users will not make direct use of IOVO’s
low-level functionality. Instead, they will use user-friendly dApps created
by other network users.  Every dApp developer can create a new scoring
along with the dApp, or use one or more existing scorings.  Hence, the
dApp author decides which user data will be used for a particular business
purpose and defines the rules for the data access.  Therefore, the actual
functionality of IOVO will be driven by the dApp developers, not by the
creators of IOVO.
•                                                                               Token
IOVO allows users to create tokens —coins of a new currency built on top
of IOVO. dApp developers can either create a new token along with their
dApp or use one an existing token.  Similar to creating a new scoring,
the author of the token specifies the rules governing how tokens will be
distributed, traded, etc.
•                                                                               Wallet
Every IOVO user will manage their assets using the IOVO wallet.  The
wallet gives the user access to their money (IOVO coins, tokens) and all
their data accessible in the network through the scorings/apps.  A single
wallet can be used to manage multiple accounts, allowing users to use
different accounts for different applications if they so choose.
•                                                                               Proof of Value
Traditional  cryptocurrencies  (like  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum)  use  proof  of
work  (PoW) as a consensus mechanism.   In the PoW approach,  every
transaction is approved (or not) by the miners.  If a disagreement arises,
the decision is made by the majority, measured in terms of computing
power. Some newer projects like NXT [8] and Casper (a new protocol for
Ethereum) [9] use proof of stake (PoS) instead. In PoS, the miners (or val-
idators) also verify the transactions; however, their reward is proportional
to their stake, which is the amount of money deposited for this purpose.
IOVO extends the idea of PoS to create the novel approach of proof of value
(PoV). Like in PoS, validators are also rewarded for verifying transactions;
however the reward is proportional to the user’s value, defined as the the
16




Figure 5: The IOVO proof of value consensus mechanism
sum of their stake and their value score.  In this way, the most valuable
users (the users with highest value scores) are rewarded for participating in
the network. The parameters for computing the value will be dynamically
adjusted:  this means that in IOVO’s early stages, when there are fewer
app users with high ratings, rewards will be distributed mainly based on
stakes.   However,  as the number of users increases,  the importance of
rating value will grow.  In other words, IOVO will smoothly evolve from
PoS to PoV.
3.2                                                                                 IOVO as a DAG
3.2.1                                                                               Limitations of existing DAG-based cryptocurrencies
Directed acyclic graph (DAG) has recently gained huge popularity as a novel
approach which can replace blockchain. DAG-based projects can be divided into
different groups, of which one particularly interesting one is single-transaction
DAGs.  These serve as the ledger for cryptocurrencies such as Byteball [3] and
IOTA  [4].   In  a single-transaction  DAG,  every  transaction is  a node in the
graph. In order to issue a new transaction, a node must approve two (or more)
other transactions.  This approval is usually done via proof of work and the
transaction being approved is directed in the DAG by an edge emanating from
the issued transaction.  This is an interesting approach; however, DAG-based
systems constructed in this way suffer from several inherent limitations:
17




1.                                                                                             No strong motivation to broadcast transactions
Every  cryptocurrency  works  as  a  peer-to-peer  network  —when  a  new
transaction appears, it is immediately broadcast to all the nodes.  This
requires users to be constantly connected.  This connectivity is easy to
achieve when the miners are used, as they must actively participate in the
network to be eligible for their rewards.  Without miners no such moti-
vation exists —the risk of being dropped by neighbouring nodes does not
seem to be a sufficient incentive to propagate transactions.
2.                                                                                             Ease of 51% computing power attack
In order to prevent spam, every user must perform some proof of work
before issuing a transaction. This cannot be too hard, because we do not
want to wait very long to approve each transaction (especially if we plan
to run the cryptocurrency software on smartphones or IoT devices). This
low PoW threshold makes a 51% attack2  relatively easy, especially in the
periods of lower activity for honest users.  IOTA currently runs special
centrally-driven nodes called coordinators to prevent such attacks [10].
3.                                                                                             Lack of computing power for smart contracts
The concept of local PoW makes it practically impossible to implement
smart contracts on such DAGs.  Even if the PoW difficulty were set to
produce  an  acceptable  verification  time  for  standard  transactions,  the
same system cannot be used to run smart contracts (which can run much
longer).  In order to support smart contracts, the network needs miners
willing to run the smart contract code.
4.                                                                                             Minimal data storage
The single-transaction DAG structure was designed to manage small, sim-
ple transactions. This idea cannot be easily scaled to storing large amounts
of data, because end devices cannot be forced to store large files.
5.                                                                                             Risk of potential attacks
Since blockchain-less DAGs have not been deployed on a large scale and
they lack strong mathematical foundations, we must be cautious about
their resistance to other potential attacks.  In particular, we have discov-
ered a double-parasite chain attack on the Tangle (the transaction DAG
used by the IOTA cryptocurrency), which, to the best of our knowledge,
cannot be prevented using the current implementation. For details of the
attack, please refer to Appendix A.
We cannot rely on the security of new technology against other possible
attacks.  For a recent example, we refer to the vulnerability found in the
Curl hash function used in IOTA [11].  Ultimately, this vulnerability did
not enable a practical attack on IOTA, and the IOTA developers patched

An attack in which a malicious user with large computing power connects to the network
and tries to outpace the rest of the network, e.g., by issuing a double-spending transaction

their implementation after the disclosure [12]. It shows, however, that we
must be very careful when introducing new features to cryptocurrencies
which have not been tested in the wild.
3.2.2                                                                              How IOVO mitigates common DAG-based issues
IOVO is designed to mitigate all the limitations listed in the previous section:
1.                                                                                 No strong motivation to broadcast transactions
IOVO is based on the novel idea of proof of value, which can be seen as
an extension of proof of stake. Certain users of the network are validators
who are rewarded for verifying transactions.  Since the validators must
be connected to the network to claim their rewards, they mitigate the
problem of propagating the transactions.
2.                                                                                 Ease of 51% computing power attack
In IOVO proof of work is replaced by proof of stake and proof of value,
rendering attacks by a single powerful malicious user practically impossi-
ble. In addition, the holders of the highest stakes and values are motivated
to participate in the network constantly and virtuously, so even in periods
of lower activity by IOVO dApp, an attacker would need to own 51% of
the stake of all stakeholders to perform a 51% attack.

In IOVO no proof of work is performed at all, so it is no problem for
low-powered devices to participate in the network.  Instead, transactions
are verified by the validators, who can have much more powerful hardware
and process more complicated transactions, including smart contracts.

Because  of  the  validators,  IOVO  users  are  not  required  to  store  large
amounts of data on their end devices. Thanks to IOVO’s multi-blockchain
DAG structure, data will be split into several blockchains, meaning only
a part of the total data needs to be stored locally.  Finally, we plan to
integrate IOVO with a distributed file system based on proofs of space
[13], which will further reduce unnecessary memory usage of the part of
validators.

which can be exposed to attacks such as the double parasite channel at-
tack (cf. Appendix A). Instead, we use well-studied blockchain technology
in which the stability and security of the network is guaranteed by val-
idators who verify all transactions using a proof-of-stake-based consensus
algorithm.

IOVO does not employ any custom untested cryptographic functions such as
Curl hash functions.  Instead, IOVO uses SHA-3, one of the most-challenged
hash function in the wild.  IOVO also uses lattice-based encryption based on
learning with errors (LWE) [14], which is also proven secure against quantum
computing attacks.
3.2.3                                                                                     IOVO DAG description
Traditional  cryptocurrencies  like  Bitcoin  [2]  and  Ethereum  [1]  are  based  on
blockchain technology. In a blockchain, all transactions are arranged in a chain
structure.  Every block of transactions extends the chain after being approved
by the miners (in the case of Bitcoin, each block appears approximately every 10
mins). Miners traditionally secure the chain by performing proof of work (PoW)
—they use their computing power to verify the transactions and perform some
calculations.  The miners are rewarded proportionally to the computing power
spent on the computation.
This traditional blockchain technology suffers from certain limitations, one of
them being scalability —networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum can only process
around                                                                                    10 transactions per second.  This makes them unacceptable to serving
as a global payment system such as VISA/Mastercard (which can process tens
of thousands of transactions per second).
To  avoid  the  limitations  of  traditional  blockchain,  several  more  flexible  ap-
proaches based on DAG (directed acyclic graph) have recently been proposed.
Among these, we can distinguish two main groups:
•  Single-transaction DAG
In this approach, every node in the DAG is a single transaction. There are
no miners to approve these transactions; instead, every author of a trans-
action acts as a miner —they must perform some small amount of proof
of work in order to issue a transaction. This PoW works as a transaction
approval mechanism and is reflected in the DAG in the following way:
an edge between nodes A and B in the graph means that the transaction
A approves the transaction B. The most notable cryptocurrencies using
a single-transaction DAG approach are Byteball [3] and IOTA [4].  The
20




Figure 7: A multi-blockchain DAG
creators of the latter introduced call their DAG the Tangle.  The stabil-
ity and security of single-transaction DAGs have not been widely studied,
and they lack strong mathematical foundations. In particular, the current
implementation of IOTA requires centrally-driven coordinators to stabi-
lize network traffic.  Moreover, because of lack of miners, we cannot be
sure these systems are fully secure against a double-spending attack (cf.
Appendix A. Double-parasite attack on the tangle).
•  Multi-blockchain DAG
The fundamental problem with a classical blockchain approach is that ev-
ery user must somehow process all the transactions present in the network,
which are stored in a single, long chain.  This can easily run to tens of
gigabytes. Several recent ideas have tackled this problem by splitting the
blockchain into many parallel chains (shardchains) which only occasion-
ally reference each other, creating a DAG structure.  The most notable
projects using multi-blockchain DAG include BitShares [5], EOS [6] and
PolkaDot [7].
The limitations of single-transaction DAGs means a multi-blockchain DAG ap-
proach is better suited to IOVO, since it preserves the secure blockchain-based
structure and facilitates scalability.  All transactions in the DAG along with
the structure of the DAG itself are publicly visible.  Thus the history of the
DAG is fully traceable and auditable; however, all sensitive data is encrypted,
meaning the only publicly accessible data is users’ public keys. Thus, IOVO is
a pseudonymous system.
3.2.4                                                                             Security and privacy in IOVO
DAG security
21




The security of the IOVO DAG is guaranteed by blockchain technology. Trans-
actions are coupled into blocks, which are verified by the validators. As long as
the majority3  of validators is honest, no one can change the history of the DAG
or perform a double-spending transaction.  This is guaranteed by the proof-of-
stake-based consensus algorithm.
Encryption
Every piece of data in IOVO is encrypted using public-key encryption algo-
rithms.  Therefore, no-one but the holder of the appropriate private key can
decrypt the encrypted data, and no one can forge their signature.
Privacy
IOVO users are identified by their public keys, which are random-looking byte
strings. Therefore, IOVO is pseudonymous —the history of all the transactions
is fully traceable, but transactions cannot be directly connected to any personal
user data. On the other hand, every user can make their address public if they
want to share their data publicly.  IOVO data wallets will allow users to man-
age several accounts, with “public” accounts for some purposes and “private”
accounts for others.
Quantum security
Recently, much attention has been paid to security against attacks performed
using quantum computers. Quantum computers are not currently practical, but
they may become a reality soon. When that happens, a lot of current-generation
cryptographic techniques will be easily broken by a sufficiently powerful quan-
tum computer.   IOVO uses post-quantum lattice-based encryption based on
learning with errors (LWE) [14], which has been proven secure against quantum
attacks.  Therefore, IOVO will remain secure even if a quantum computer is
created.
3.2.5                                                                                  Consensus algorithm
Every decentralized system is based on a consensus algorithm used for resolving
conflicts.   Traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are based
on proof of work.  In PoW, the miners use their computing power to perform
mathematical computations (basically, they compute the value of a given hash
function many times). To avoid wasting electricity on useless computations, an
approach called proof of stake was developed in which the miners (now usually
called validators) also verify the transactions, but their reward is proportional to

22




the size of their deposit rather than the amount of computing power expended.
3.2.6                                                                               Proof of value
IOVO further develops the concept of proof of stake to create proof of value. In
proof of value, block rewards are distributed according to the combined value
of each user. Hence users are rewarded for their value, they are incentivized to
work on maintaining high value and they do not need to deposit money to earn
more money.
3.2.7                                                                               Why IOVO will work
The stability,  security and performance of IOVO is guaranteed by the well-
studied components which IOVO is constructed from:
•   Multi-blockchain  DAG  —IOVO  harnesses  the  potential  of  blockchain
technology while maintaining scalability and performance.
•   Proof of value —IOVO extends the well-tested proof-of-stake algorithm
to make use of a user’s value instead of their stake.
•  Public-key cryptography —IOVO uses asymmetric cryptography to han-
dle users’ addresses. This makes all their data secure while preserving ease
and transparency of usage.
•  Lattice-based encryption —post-quantum encryption algorithms based on
learning with errors (LWE) keeps users’ data secure even in the presence
of a quantum computer
3.3                                                                                 IOVO Wallet
The IOVO wallet is users’ gateway to the IOVO network. The main goal of the
IOVO wallet is to provide access to basic functionalities such as sharing data,
receiving messages, performing transactions using IOVO coins, and aggregating
all the user data that has been stored by various applications in the IOVO
blockchain.
The IOVO wallet allows a user to manage multiple addresses that are generated
from a single master key.   This gives each user full control over their data,
including the ability to easily transfer data to another device simply by knowing
the master key.  Users can create a new address for each dApp on the IOVO
23




network or a single address can be shared between many applications, allowing
users to change privacy preferences for a specific dApp at any time. The IOVO
wallet will aggregate data from every address linked to the master key.
3.4                                                                                  IOVO Manifests
Each IOVO-based application must publish its manifest. A manifest is similar to
a smart contract familiar from other cryptocurrencies, but it has been adapted to
IOVO-specific requirements. The main goal of the manifest is to determine what
type of data will be processed by the application.  For example, the manifest
for an application used to check programming skills might specify that a user
receives a rating in the “Java” category in the range from 0 to 100. The manifest
is therefore a collection of all categories and their values.  Categories are used
not only to inform users about what data has been collected but also to query
users who meet certain criteria. In this context, we can consider categories to be
similar to keywords, i.e., if the recruiter wants to search for a Java programmer,
the search algorithm would first look through the available manifests and check
whether the appropriate category exists, and then checks which addresses have
values in this category and whether those values meet a particular threshold or
fall within a particular range.
The manifest also determines whether an application will emit its own token,
for example to reward users. The manifest also specifies all the operations that
can be performed on a specific token.  Finally, the manifest determines how
transaction fees are shared between the application and the IOVO network. For
example, if a recruitment company wanted to search for all users meeting the
criterion “Java  ¿ 80”, it would have to pay.  The fee for the search would be
divided between the application developers (commission) and the users who had
their data queried in the ratio specified in the manifest.
3.5                                                                                  Smart contracts
Every  IOVO  transaction  can  contain  a  script  written  in  a  Turing-complete
scripting language. This enables users to create arbitrarily complex smart con-
tracts which run on top of IOVO. Each contract transaction has a higher fee com-
puted using a gas-based system.  This fee goes to validators who are rewarded
for verifying all the transactions according to their combined value /textemdash
a factor computed from the stake and the value score of each user.

3.6                                                                                    Integration of existing applications
Nowadays,  most  users  are  migrating  from  desktop  devices  to  smartphones.
Knowing this,  IOVO must provide tools to allow easy integration of mobile
applications with the IOVO network.  IOVO will provide frameworks for the
leading mobile platforms, which will enable simple integration and will allow
support basic operations on the IOVO blockchain.
IOVO not only allows dApps to store their data in a secure and transparent way;
it also gives dApp owners the opportunity to increase revenues by monetizing
user data (provided the data owner agrees).
3.7                                                                                    Scorings
Almost all IOVO value-related features are underpinned by scoring mechanisms,
or “scorings”.  Each scoring is a user-generated protocol which collects partial
scores about the4  target user and uses them to compute the user’s final score. In
the simplest case, a scoring can be a numeric scale in some category. Let’s say an
eBay-like application has been built on top of IOVO. Following each transaction,
the buyer would give a partial score to the seller.  Then the final score might
simply be made up of the mean of all the partial scores.  This example was
chosen for its simplicity; it is easy to imagine much more complicated types of
scoring, for example:
•   An insurance company runs on top of IOVO and every car incident in-
volving a particular driver is recorded as a partial score in an IOVO trans-
action. The final score is the driver’s insurance premium.
•  A bank (or a system of banks) runs on top of IOVO and every loan taken
and every instalment paid are recorded as a partial score in an IOVO
transactions. The final score is the client’s creditworthiness.
Not every part of a score needs to come from IOVO transactions. For example,
the author of a scoring might assign some initial score to users.  This would
be useful for institutions migrating to IOVO who want to transfer previously
gathered user data. Crucially, there is no single formula for computing a user’s
final score; the creator of the scoring can arbitrarily create any and all rules and
publish them as the scoring manifest.
4 Anyone can create a scoring and publish all its rules as a manifest
25




3.7.1                                                                                     Notation
We will denote all scorings by S1 , S2 , ..., Si . The final score of user U in scoring
Si  will be denoted by Si (U ), and all the partial scores for user U in scoring Si
will be denoted by S1 (U ), S2 (U ), ..., Si                                              n (U ). The partial scores are broadcast in
encrypted form using the target user’s public key pku :
                                                                                          Ej (U ) = Encpk                               u                                                                               (Sj (U ))
                                                                                                                                        Therefore only U can compute his own final score from the public information.
3.7.2                                                                                     Requesting a score
The primary data operation within the IOVO system is the score request.  In
this operation, user A wants to know Si (B), the score of user B in scoring Si .
This score depends on all the partial scores S1 (B), S2 (B), ..., Si                      n (B) that appear
in the transaction history in the encrypted form E1 (B), E2 (B), ..., Ei                  n (B). The
only way to reveal the score is to evaluate the following function:
Revealsk                                                                                  B                                             (E1 (B), E2 (B), ..., Ei                                                        n (B))
This can only be done by someone who knows the secret key skB .  Therefore,
the whole procedure of acquiring a score will consist of the following phases:
•  A. A collects all the partial scores E1 (B), E2 (B), ..., Ei                           n (B) from the net-
work.
•  B. A broadcasts a transaction Request(A, B, E1 (B), E2 (B), ..., Ei
n (B)) with
c coins attached to it.
•  C. When B notices a Request transaction addressed to him, he (locally)
computes his score using the formula:
(s, π) = RevealskB (E1 (B), E2 (B), ..., Ein (B)),
where s is the computed score and π is a zero-knowledge proof that it was
correctly computed on the given set of partial scores (E2 (B), ..., Ei                    n (B)).
The proof π is important since it is a guarantee that B used all available
data and did not use any fake partial scores.
26




•  D. B  broadcasts a transaction Claim(A, B, EncpkA (s), π) to claim the
reward of c coins. The score, s, is encrypted with A’s public key to prevent
other users from seeing the result (recall that all transactions are publicly
visible).
The Request transaction can be implemented as a time-locked Ethereum-like
smart contract  —it transfers ccoins to B  only if B  will broadcast a correct
Claim transaction within some given time period Δt.  In that case the Claim
transaction will be sent to the Request contract (it will call a contract function).
If the transaction is not issued within Δt time, the c coins will automatically
be returned to A.
Thanks to the mechanism of requesting a score, IOVO users are incentivized to
actively participate in the network —they will claim the reward for revealing
their score only in cases where they react to a request within the timeframe
window Δt.
3.7.3                                                                                      Search engine
The mechanism of requesting a score allows users to generate arbitrarily complex
search queries through the network.  Imagine user A wants to find all network
users, U , whose scoring Si (U ) satisfies some condition λ(Si (U ), e.g., Si (U ) > T .
Since all the partial scores are encrypted, A does not know in advance which
users will satisfy the condition.  A could send a Request transaction to every
other user in the network, but then he would be obliged to pay every requested
user, even those not satisfying the condition.
Instead, A can send a modified transaction:
CondRequest(A, B, E1 (B), E2 (B), ..., λ)
which is a conditional request —a user can only claim the reward if he reveals
a correctly computed score Si (U ), such that it satisfies the condition λ(Si (U )).
By doing this, A can create arbitrarily complex search queries and pay only the
set of users who satisfy the filtering rules.
3.7.4                                                                                      Creating new scorings
At any given time, any user can create a new scoring by publishing its manifest.
A manifest is a transaction whose script contains a set of rules that specify
27




what partial scores are allowed and how to compute the final score from the
partial scores.  Among others, the manifest contains the code of the Reveal
function.  Every time a user refers to a scoring Si , it is referred by the hash of
the transaction containing its manifest.
There are deliberately no restrictions on the rules for creating a manifest: any
manifest can be published, provided it is written correctly in the IOVO scripting
language. In particular, the author can freely set the rules for paying for reveal-
ing the scoring, e.g., he can introduce a fee for every scoring revealed which is
paid to him. It is, however, in his interest to introduce rules such that users are
more likely to use his scoring.
3.7.5                                                                                 Earning on scorings
In the most probable scenario, scorings will be created with a fee for requesting
a score.  The user who reveals his score will be paid from this fee.  Moreover,
many requests will be directed to some narrow set of the most valuable users in
some category. Therefore:
•   users are incentivized to actively participate in the network in order to
claim the rewards for revealing their score, and
•   users are incentivized to maintain the highest possible scores, to be in-
cluded in as many possible narrowed search requests as they can.
3.7.6                                                                                 Security of scorings
Scorings in IOVO are constructed in a way that guarantees their security and
integrity.  Firstly, all the partial scores are encrypted with a public key of the
target user, so only he can encrypt it and no one else can extract any information
from them. Furthermore, the final scores are computed locally, so no information
from this computation is leaked to the network. Finally, the correctness of the
computed score can be easily verified using the zero-knowledge proof (and, by
design, no other information from this computation is leaked).
3.8                                                                                   Data storage and aggregation
All user data in IOVO is stored in the transaction DAG using scoring mecha-
nisms. Thus, the only publicly accessible data are the encrypted partial scores.
The only way to access the users valuable data is through the mechanisms for
28




revealing scorings, which is secured by smart contracts.  In addition, all data
access functions as a zero-knowledge proof and hence does not leak any infor-
mation besides the requested data.
As the IOVO network grows, it will need more and more space for data storage.
Therefore, we use a distributed storage system based on proofs of space [13].
3.9                                                                                  Sending text messages and invitations
IOVO enables users to send text messages through the mechanism of transac-
tions. Any user can send a message to any other user as long as they know the
destination address.  The mechanism of requesting a score serves as an invita-
tion system: if your search query returns a user satisfying particular conditions,
you will obtain an address to directly contact the person thus found.
Messages can be sent publicly (in which case everyone in the network can read
it) or encrypted using recipients public key, making it accessible only to the
receiver.
3.10                                                                                 IOVO as a database
IOVO serves as a database.  It stores all the data gathered from all the IOVO
apps.  Primary access to this data is maintained through the low-level mecha-
nism of scorings; however, dApp developers can create arbitrary user-friendly
features to enable convenient access to this data, as with a regular database.
3.11                                                                                 Platform  for  aggregation,  analysis  and  ordering  of
data
IOVO app developers can freely create tools for data aggregation and analysis.
Users can use these tools not only to analyze data themselves, but also to “trade
data.  This, e.g., creates an opportunity for rating companies to create fully
adjustable ratings and sell them to their customers.  Separately, IOVO allows
users to “order particular data from such companies, allowing them to perform
arbitrarily complex queries on the data.

All user data on the IOVO network is accessed using zero-knowledge proofs [15].
Thanks to this cryptographic technique, in every query only the desired part
of the data is released and no other information is leaked. Hence, users can be
sure that none of their data is exposed beyond that which they decided to make

3.13.1                                                                            Value score
In order to allow IOVO to smoothly evolve from Proof-of-Stake to Proof-of-
Value, we must define the combined value as a function of value score.  This
is based on the assumption that the most valuable data is that which had the
most coins spent on revealing it.
31




Figure 11: The IOVO combined value function for proof of value.
The combined value is the public mathematical function CombinedV alue(x, y, z),
where x represents the total amount of IOVO coins spent on IOVO search engine
results concerning the user in a given rating, y represents the total amount of
IOVO coins deposited by the user as a stake and z represents the total amount of
coins in the system. It is designed to represent how valuable a given user’s assets
are. The CombinedV alue function must satisfy the following assumptions:
•  A. It depends on the total amount of IOVO coins paid to the user for
revealing his ratings
•  B. It depends on the amount of money deposited by the user, but the
importance of this factor tends to zero with the growth of IOVO network,
and the amount of information stored in it.
•  C. It is dynamically changing and actualized every time the user earns
from revealing his assets.
•  D. It should be not easy to change rapidly for a given user  (this is to
prevent attacks).
Given the above, we define the function as:
CombinedV alue(x, y, z) = log(x)(y
z + 1)
Note that if z  tends to 0, then z  + 1 tends to 1, in which case it has no impact
on the combined value. Moreover, as the network grows, z  will decrease even for
the wealthiest user, because of growing demand and the new coins being mined.
Thus, we can say that point B is satisfied.  One could argue that  z  + 1 grows
32




Figure 12: Process of calculating a user’s combined value score
linearly with y , but in practice y will be very small in comparison to z, which
in turn leads to the observation, that changes in x will have more influence on
the combined value —precisely what we want.
Extrapolating from these properties of the combined value we see that in the
final stages of IOVO the combined value will depend almost only on user ratings
and not on the amount of coins held.
3.13.2                                                                               Dynamic fee system
For the system to work, there needs to be some entities intermediating in queries
by providing computational power and memory space.  This is only possible if
this role comes with a profit. We propose that this should be financed as a part
of the fee paid when issuing a query. This fee should vary, so it is adjusted well
to the conditions in the system.  We call these users who sustain the network
“validators”.
Assume that the query in the following considerations is fixed.  Let c be the
cost of the computations needed to handle the query. We argue that fee should
satisfy the following properties:
•  Obviously the fee should be greater than c.
•  We define the memory load M (t) as the percentage of memory provided
33




Figure 13: Change in the weightings for stake and value as the IOVO network
matures
34




by the validators in use at time t. If it is high, the fees should be higher,
to provide a clear stimulus to sustain the network.
•  Analogously, we define the computation load C (t), except we look at the
average of computational power used in the time interval [t − h, t] (recall
that h is the time take to issue a single transaction) as some short queues
are acceptable in this case. We want C (t) to satisfy the same property as
M (t).
•   As  the  IOVO  economy  is  mostly  based  on  queries,  people  should  be
encouraged to make a lot of them.  Thus, the price should be lower as
number of queries, N , performed by the same user (so N ≥ 1) grows. At
the same time, the percentage discount should not be greater than some
threshold 0 ≤ K < 1.
Considering the above, we define the fee function as:
fee(t) =   K
g(N )eC (t)+M (t)
where g is some increasing function with limit 1.  Such a function is not hard
to find, and it should be adjusted to grow reasonably. Note that eC (t)+M (t)  = 1
when there is no load in the system and it grows considerably (which can be
further adjusted with some parameters) as the load increases.

The IOVO DAG is designed for rapid development and is conceived to expand
to cover as many social and commercial fields as possible a very short period.

exist as users do not satisfy the requirements.  For simplicity, we ignore that
possibility here.)

Therefore,  particular tools to support this rapid development have been in-
cluded in the plans for the systems expansion.  The initial stages of expansion
development will cover the IOVO development teams own projects, explained
in Section2.7.  In addition, the most promising IOVO DAG-based projects will
be accelerated under the guidance of the IOVO Foundation.
5.2                                                                                 The IOVO Foundation
After final technical development and testing of the transformational IOVO
DAG, the development team will shift its focus to the progress of the IOVO
Foundation legal entity.   The IOVO Foundation will work as an accelerator
for the most promising projects proposed or already under development on the
IOVO DAG. Once taken under the wings of the IOVO Foundation, the chosen
projects will find multiple tools necessary for their development, such as legal,
technical and marketing support.  The greater the number of successful IOVO
DAG-based projects and the greater their popularity, the faster the whole IOVO
database network will grow.
5.3                                                                                 Roadmap
                                                                                    The current roadmap is available at www.iovo.io

6.1                                                                                 Legal and regulatory risk
As the IOVO DAG is dedicated to data and data-related processes, there is a
small risk of legal interest from certain national and international regulatory
bodies.  However, it is important to note that IOVO itself does not store or
process data as an entity; instead, IOVO facilitates data collection, storage and
use for it users, who maintain full decision-making control over the data they
generate and own.
6.2                                                                                 Market risk
The primary market risk for IOVO is that insufficient dApps will be developed
on the IOVO DAG and therefore the system will not scale as quickly as pre-
37




dicted.  This risk is limited by the strategy chosen by the IOVO Foundation.
The IOVO Foundation is a full-time project and ICO accelerator, and thus will
function as a fully operational framework for the most promising IOVO DAG-
based projects in development. The IOVO Foundation will provide professional
help in bringing these projects to market, securing the overall growth of the
IOVO network and a constant influx of users.
6.3                                                                                   Technical risk
On superficial inspection, the proof-of-value algorithm may seem to have certain
vulnerabilities.  For example, since a user’s combined value depends on their
value score, which is related to the amount of money spent on requesting that
particular user’s data, a malicious user could artificially inflate their own value
score by making a lot of scoring requests about themselves.  However, every
scoring request involves a fee, and the parameters are set such that this fee is
always higher than the potential increase in value resulting from the request.
In other words, an artificial scoring request would negatively affect a users total
combined value, so this attack would not give any advantage to the malicious
party.
6.4                                                                                   Financial risk
Users and investors may be concerned about losing money to malicious attacks
or market fluctuations. We will try to address some of those concerns here.
One security issue affecting other cryptocurrencies is the potential hijacking of
the network. If a malicious user or group of users can acquire 51% of total voting
power, they can defraud other users.  But in the case of IOVO, voting power
is derived from combined value  (for a detailed description, see Section  3.13).
As this value changes very slowly and validators are incentivized to participate
constantly in the consensus algorithm, it is virtually impossible to perform this
kind of attack on the IOVO network.
Another possible concern is fluctuation in the value of the IOVO token.  This
cannot be easily predicted, but in the long run the value of IOVO should tend
to increase rather than decrease, because the amount of data in the network
will constantly grow.

the tangle
In this appendix we present a double-spending attack on the tangle  a transac-
tion DAG (directed acyclic graph) structure used in the IOTA cryptocurrency.
The attack is based on the parasite chain attack which is described in the tan-
gle white paper together with a method to defend against it.  To the best of
our knowledge, none of the original tangle mechanisms can prevent the double-
parasite chain attack described below.
8.1                                                                                                 A.1 Introduction
The  tangle  is  a  novel  instance  of  a  transaction  DAG  which  supersedes  the
blockchain technology used in most traditional cryptocurrencies. The structure
and security properties of the tangle are described in the IOTA white paper [4].
The tangle is the basis for a new cryptocurrency called IOTA 5 . We begin by
presenting a simplified version to aid understanding before moving on to explain
the full version of the attack.
8.2                                                                                                 A.2 The attack (simplified version)
Assume a malicious party, A, owns  1% of the total computing power of the
rest of the network.  This party can now “mine” a parasite chain consisting of
transactions of total weight w, while the rest of the network produces a main
chain consisting of transactions of total weight 100w.6
Furthermore, assume (similar to the authors of [4]) that the transaction is ac-
cepted by the merchant once it achieves some threshold cumulative weight of
w0 .
The attack consists of the following steps:
•  1.  At some time, t0 , A creates two conflicting transactions, tx1  and tx2 ,
each directly attached to the current top of the network (the two squares
on the left in figure XXX). A does not publish these transactions yet.
5 https://iota.org
6 For  simplicity,  we  assume  the  parasite  chain  does  not  approve  any  transactions  from
the main chain.   Actually,  the attacker can make his parasite much more  “important” by
systematically approving the topmost transaction from the main chain.
40




•  2.  a now splits their computing power to work on two parallel parasite
chains:
10% computing power to work on parasite chain one (P C1 ) on top of tx1
and
90% computing power to work on parasite chain two (P C2 ) on top of tx2 .
•  3. A waits until P C1  achieves a total weight of transactions equal to w0 .
At this point, P C2  should have a total weight of transactions roughly equal
to  9w0 , and the main tangle should have a total weight of transactions
roughly equal to 1000w0  (since the rest of the network has approximately
100 times more computing power than the attacker).
•  6.  At this point, A publishes P C1  and waits until the merchant accepts
it.  This should occur immediately, because we defined w0 to be exactly
equal to the threshold of cumulative transaction weight to be accepted by
the merchant.
•  7. Once the merchant accepts tx1 , the attacker publishes P C2 .
At this time the rest of the network will see two conflicting transactions:  tx1
approved by P C1  and tx2  approved by P C2 . Because P C2  is approximately nine
times larger, tx2  will have approximately 100 times greater cumulative weight.
This means the rest of the network will probably accept tx2  as the correct one,
effectively allowing A to perform a double-spending transaction.
Note that A’s 1% ratio of computing power was chosen arbitrarily; an analogous
attack is possible for less powerful users, but it will take longer to succeed.
8.3                                                                                 A.3 Full version of the attack
In the simplified version of the attack, it can be argued that the random walkers
in the MCMC tip selection algorithm will never choose both parasite chains, so
neither of the two conflicting transactions will be approved.  However, A can
easily improve the attack to ensure P C2  will be merged into the main chain,
and all its transactions will be treated as regular transactions from the main
chain. This can be done by performing two actions:
•  While constructing the consecutive elements of P C2 , A can always choose
to approve the following two transactions:  (1) the previous transactions
from the parasite chain and  (2) the tip from the main tangle with the
highest score (according to the MCMC tip selection algorithm).
41




•  After P C2  is published, A can help it to be merged with the main tangle by
issuing the transactions which approves the top transaction of this chain
and the best-scored (according to the MCMC tip selection algorithm) tip
from the main chain.
This improved version of the attack is visualized in figure XXX below.
It is easy to see that, constructed in this way, P C2  is part of the main
tangle.   For most random walkers,  the tip selected during the MCMC
algorithm will indirectly approve the conflicting transaction from P C2 .
