A   blockchain is a distributed database, which makes the
creation of a digital ledger of transactions and share it among a
distributed network of computers possible. It uses
cryptography to allow each participant on the network to
manipulate the ledger in a secure way without the need for a
central authority. It maintains a continuously-growing list of       Blockchain
records (blocks), each containing a timestamps and a link to
the previous one.
Technology
Emarat Coin is built and available on a blockchain Technology.
The main reason for using blockchain technology in the
development of Emarat Coin (AEC) is to provide a
decentralized infrastructure that is stable and secure for all the
involving parties.

Blockchain  technology  offers  a  secure,  fast,  and  cheaper
medium of carrying out online transaction and online transfer
of information without the need of third party verification. The
adoption of blockchain technology in financial services sector
has  gained  traction.  Banking  sector  is  willing  to  explore
opportunities which would make the banking transactions more
transparent  and  easy  to  process.  Increased  penetration  of
digital  technology  in the  banking  sector  has  resulted in the

The demand for blockchain technology is expected to increase in the coming years owing to the investments in
blockchain technology. America is expected to lead the blockchain technology market during the forecast
period. Asia Pacific region is expected to witness the highest growth rate of blockchain technology during the
forecast period. The Middle East is in the early phases of adoption of the technology. The blockchain technology
market is compressive of a large number  of startups. The growth of blockchain technology startups was aided by
huge venture capital investments during the period from 2015 to 2017. The market is expected to be hit by a huge
wave of mergers and acquisitions in the coming years.

21st-century unicorn - or the money of the future?
Today cryptocurrencies have become a global phenomenon
known to most people. While still somehow geeky and not
understood by most people, banks, governments and many
companies are aware of its importance. Cryptocurrency is a
form of digital money that is designed to be secure and, in
many cases, anonymous.
Crypto-
It is a currency associated with the internet that uses
cryptography, the process of converting legible information into
an almost uncrack able code, to track purchases and transfers .
Currencies
Cryptography was born out of the need for secure
communication in the Second World War. It has evolved in the
digital era with elements of mathematical theory and computer
science to become a way to secure communications,
information and money online.
10




The first cryptocurrency was bitcoin, which was created in
2009 and is still the best known. There has been a proliferation
of cryptocurrencies in the past decade and there are now more
than 900 available on the internet.
Cryptocurrencies use decentralized technology to let users
make secure payments and store money without the need to
use their name or go through a bank. They run on a distributed
public ledger called blockchain, which is a record of all
transactions updated and held by currency holders.
Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called
mining, which involves using computer power to solve
complicated math’s problems that generate coins. Users can
also buy the currencies from brokers, then store and spend
those using cryptographic wallets.
Cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain technology
are still nascent in financial terms and more uses should be
expected. Transactions including bonds, stocks and other
financial assets could eventually be traded using the
technology.

reversed and there tend to be low fees, making it more reliable
than conventional currency. Their decentralized nature means           Cryptocurrencies?
they are available to everyone, where banks can be exclusive
in who they will let open accounts.
As a new form of cash, the cryptocurrency markets have been
known to take off meaning a small investment can become a
large sum overnight. But the same works the other way.
People look to invest in cryptocurrencies should be aware of
the volatility of the market and the risks they take when
buying.
Because of the level of anonymity they offer, cryptocurrencies
are often associated with illegal activity, particularly on the dark
web. Users should be careful about the connotations when
choosing to buy the currencies.
