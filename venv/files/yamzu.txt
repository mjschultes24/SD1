Abstract
Opportunity
Not only is the eSports market in the midst of an economic boom, but new revenue
stream  opportunities  are  also  emerging  on  a  daily  basis  within  this  broader
marketplace. New technologies such as smart contracts, decentralized applications,
and  the  Blockchain  represent  an  unprecedented  opportunity  for  a  successful
company to pinpoint its niche in the evolving gaming universe. We believe established
companies in particular stand to gain the most from the application of new emerging
technologies to online gaming.
Solution
eSports  have  evolved  from  a  simple  simple  amusement  into  a  full-fledged
entertainment phenomenon on par with many traditional sports. Professional eSports
teams now hold multi-million-dollar sponsorships, compete in tournaments around
the world, and fill up entire arenas with supporters (and soon, they will take over
television lineups). New generations are now growing up inspired by adults who can
make a living by playing video games and more and more eSports enthusiasts want
to pursue this newly formed career path. The next frontier in competitive gaming will
be creating the opportunity for gamers to play eSports directly from the comfort
of their own homes, without having to find a sponsor to financially support them.
None of this will be possible without the introduction of a platform that will allow
gamers to monetize their winnings. Yamzu wishes to provide players with a browser-
based platform for eSports that will specifically cater to this need. Yamzu’s platform
is tailored to include every type of player, amateurs and professionals alike. Yamzu
has  already  successfully  integrated  Counterstrike  Global  Offensive                 (“CS:GO”)
and League of Legends (“LoL”)   on its platform, and now that both titles are live,
other computer based games have entered the pipeline and are scheduled to be
implemented in the near future.
The Company
Yamzu is a successful Swedish Gaming Company with a current user base of over
10,000 players. We earn revenue, and we have worked to put forth a recognizable
brand. Both of these characteristics stand our organization in good stead to take
full advantage of the new revenue streams opportunities generated by Blockchain-
related technology. Yamzu is different from its newly formed competitors since it is
an active and real business which has already been in operation since 2016 and has
since than achieved a staggering result of 300% growth rate on revenues. Yamzu’s
team  has accumulated direct experience on the field that cannot be replicated by its
newly formed competitors. This means that Yamzu can implement its groundbreaking
ideas much faster than the rest of the market. Since gamers recognize our brand,
they will be quick to adapt to our platform. Yamzu has already earned and allocated
significant amounts of revenue into the business therefore we are ideally positioned
to repurpose the potential funds obtainable through the Token Sale to pursue the
expansion of our business worldwide thanks to the implementation of Blockchain
technology.

1. Yamzu Overview




1. Yamzu Overview
Yamzu  is  designed  as  a  fully  operational,  browser-based  eSports  tournament
platform. The Yamzu platform makes eSports competitions available to any gamer
in any location on Earth.
The platform is the only one of its kind, being entirely browser-based. Rival companies
face constant struggles due to users’ privacy concerns, and several other entry
barriers such as the need to download a user interface. Meanwhile, our internal
user research shows that a browser-based platform does indeed show more growth
potential.  These  factors  instill  confidence,  especially  considering  Yamzu’s  pre-
existing user base (10,000) and irrefutable track record of 300% annual growth in just
two years of activity.
Platform
The platform is tailored to suit the needs of:
Players and teams battling for prizes and rewards.
Brands, influencers, and organizations that wish to set up tournaments.
Advertisers and sponsors targeting eSports audiences.
Currently Yamzu supports CS:GO and LoL, two of the most popular eSports games
in the world. The platform is ready to integrate many more popular games such as
DOTA2, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and PUBG.

Revenue generation
Yamzu generates revenue through the following three outlets:
1. Yamzu retains a fee from each entry fee payed by the users to gain access to tour-
naments or to set up matches among peers. The fee structure is designed in the
following way:
12.5% for games/tournaments where there are less than two teams participating;
15% for games/tournaments where there are more than two teams participating;
Of the above described fees, 2.5% is the current VAT (Value Added Tax)  and is
paid directly by Yamzu to the relevant government.
2. Yamzu licenses its engine to companies wishing to hold events.
3. Yamzu holds sponsored events for brands wishing for exclusive rights to hold  events
online.
Note: See appendix for Financial Statements.

Vision
As a brand, Yamzu plans to branch out into several niches of the gaming industry—
including but not limited to entertainment hubs, talent agencies supporting Twitch
streamers, and niche-oriented clothing lines.
In the long-term, Yamzu envisions the platform as a genuine household name for
eSports competitions of any skill level. At the same time, we are developing several
Blockchain based projects on the platform, some of which are almost ready to be
implemented.
Yamzu is determined to become a leading eSports tournament provider and host,
one both affiliated with P2P (Peer to Peer) gaming as well as with significant regional
and global tournaments. The fact that Yamzu already supports an active platform
gives strength to our projections. In the future, we will work with game developers by
forming symbiotic relationships surrounding the creation of new games. In doing so,
both Yamzu and value creators (e.g. developers) will collaborate to encourage more
gamers to participate at the intersection of paid gaming and  cryptocurrency.

Sponsorships and advertising
The current revenue model adopted by most players in the industry is one where
companies trying to promote their respective brands allocate relevant funds into
sponsoring both championships and tournaments alike. eSports companies collect
the money provided through sponsorships and the sponsoring companies capitalize
on the visibility of the players competing in the event to promote their image to the
audience following the competition.
The image below shows the various companies which have recently sponsored LoL
tournaments.

One of the companies that has been active since the dawn of the eSports industry
and is without a doubt its pioneer is RedBull.
The following image shows several dedicated brands utilized by RedBull to sponsor
specific eSports events:

Prize pool
The revenue model described above also entails that the main sponsor, besides
sponsoring the event, will moreover provide the prize pool to be delivered to the
winner of the tournament.

eSport betting
The gambling system in eSports functions in exactly the same way as  classical sports
betting. Viewers can bet on who will be crowned winner of the tournament or bet just
on a single match. The revenues for eSports companies operating in the gambling
sector are derived from the subtraction of all bets won from the amount comprising
of all lost bets. Companies that operate following this revenue stream model are
both eSports companies and classic betting companies alike.

Media events
Tournaments are streamed through web-tv and viewers usually pay to watch the
event. Companies can monetize the event through entry fees and through the
superior number of views deriving from the online streaming of the event.
The following graph shows just how relevant eSports events are in terms of viewership
even if compared with traditional sports events:

4. Use Cases




4. Use Cases
The following use cases demonstrate how platforms starting with Yamzu will usher
the rest of the industry into an age in which gamers can capitalize on the enormous
potential for monetization of the eSports market.
Use Case #1: Lack of Good Business in Practice
Problem
Unfair working conditions have plagued value creators in the gaming industry ever
since eSports started generating revenues for professional gamers.
The reason behind this scenario is that the industry has evolved so rapidly, rules and
regulations governing working conditions are still in a constant a state of flux. As a
result, eSports has seen a multitude of cases in which players were not rightfully
compensated, contracts were breached and the reputation of professional teams
was irremediably tarnished.
Solution
Yamzu’s completely automated system is based on user created events which
effectively remove any form of uncertainty.
Gamers will be paid automatically the end of each match/tournament through a
system of automated prize pool allocations powered by Blockchain Technology;
there is practically no room for error. Thanks to the introduction of Smart Contracts
each transaction will be executed automatically, both sponsors and users will
send and receive funds to and from their wallets in a much safer and efficient way.
Smart Contracts cannot be tampered with by external sources, which means that
the beneficiaries will be 100% sure to receive rightful compensation for their efforts.
Moreover, the adoption of virtual currencies as a means of payment will bring about
several other options for monetization that our users will be able to capitalize on.

Use Case #2: Lack of Business Tools
Problem
As of today, there is no go-to marketplace where business tools are made available
to eSports enthusiasts. Therefore, players, most of whom bring more value to the
gaming industry than they receive in return, are left with no resources to build a
career in the eSports business.
Solution
Yamzu provides business entities (such as sponsors and affiliates) with the opportunity
to create events directly on the platform, hence allowing them to enhance their
image as well as promoting their products. Consequentially, gamers will gain access
to tournaments with major prize pools along with the chance to increase their
reputation and visibility by performing well in the event.
Only three steps separate a sponsor (approaching Yamzu for the first time) from
sponsoring an event:
1. Register on Yamzu.
2. Create an online event.
3. Invite gamers.
It is in the interest of sponsors and other business entities alike to take advantage of
the additional business tools available on our platform:
Custom events
where a sponsor can tailor this or that event to their specific needs.
Integrated streaming
where streamers will enjoy frictionless broadcasting to their viewers.
An interface to plan future events
where entities will use our browser-less platform.
Region-targeted events
where business entities will capitalize on target demographics.
Access to commentators
where events will gain larger viewership from broadcast talent.
20




Access to design talent
where entities will promote events effortlessly through designs.
Access to video editors
where talent will create highlights available for online upload.
Use Case #3.1: Tournament Costs
Problem
Sponsors and advertisers have to face several obstacles when   it comes to the
logistical aspects behind arranging an eSports tournament. They must manually
search  for  teams,  meet  these  teams’  requirements,  and  meet  the  high  costs
associated with renting venues, not to mention the costs associated with branding.
Solution
Companies who want to sponsor or advertise through eSports  tournaments will find
the perfect partner in Yamzu. Influencers will also receive auxiliary benefits, such as
the ability to host larger tournaments. Sponsors will not have to spend time and
invaluable resources on manually searching for teams since they can be created
directly on our platform. Moreover, setting up a tournament on Yamzu is completely
free of charge, no extra fee will be required of the sponsors. They only need to provide
the prize pool which will be converted into tokens by Yamzu and the event is ready to
launch. In the unfortunate event of the tournament not reaching a sufficient number
of subscriptions, the sponsors will not have spent anything.
Due to the platform being entirely online-based, sponsors can advertise without
having to incur any additional costs. Besides the aforementioned advantages,
utilizing Yamzu’s platform will give access to the efficiency and speed native of
Blockchain technology, that will ensure the correct execution of transactions as well
as the reduction of expenses otherwise applicable   (e.g. bank fees, legal fees, etc…).
21




Use Case #3.2: Travel in eSports
Problem
The eSports infrastructure we know today geographically limits both the scope of
its audience and the quality of the players who compete in tournaments. Only a
handful of cities around the world host events, therefore putting players and teams
in a difficult situation from a logistical and economic standpoint. They must acquire
sponsors to finance the expenses incurred by travel and accommodation, all just for
the chance to compete in a tournament.
Solution
Teams  and  players  competing  on  Yamzu  need  not  concern  themselves  with
purchasing expensive flights or booking hotel rooms, nor with the several additional
costs associated with travelling. As we have mentioned in previous use cases, Yamzu
simply removes the logistical element which heretofore had plagued eSports events.
Thanks to Yamzu’s platform players can create tournaments directly from their
homes, without having to plan any trips, just with the click of a button.
Use Case #4: Cyber-Bullying
Problem
However unlikely it may be to encounter a cyber-bully (also known in the online
community as “troll”), gamers and athletes on the internet nonetheless are nevertheless
left vulnerable to exposure to disrespectful language from a small but still present
minority. Such exposure may affect not only their tournament performance but also
their offline livelihood.
Solution
Community reviews on the Yamzu platform leave cyber-bullies   very little leeway.
While we recognize there is a difference between good-natured ribbing and bullying,
at the same time players have the right to enjoy every gaming experience. Due to
there being such a fine line between what’s offensive and what may not be, our
community adjusts to a sensitive scale, one one in which if a user sends too many
negative reports, the value of these reports will be diminished.
22




Use Case #5: Disparity Between Amateurs and Professionals
Problem
The wage gap between amateur and professional gamers has become increasingly
wider. The main reason the gap has not yet been bridged is the absence of a unified
platform where eSports  professionals, amateurs, and investors can collaborate and
compete with one another.
Solution
The Yamzu platform functions as a great equalizer when it comes to the status of
our users. While not everyone will achieve the same level of success in competitions,
players will be on a level playing field, where only skills matter. Through our platform
it will be possible even for amateur players to participate in major tournaments
organized by Yamzu and gain access to much higher prize pools that thus far have
been completely out of reach to them.
Use Case #6: Lack of Open Sponsorship Model
Problem
Currently in the eSports market there is no platform allowing players to create their
own events as well as enabling sponsors to access broad audiences through brand-
led competitions.
Solution
Yamzu’s users can organize their own tournaments independent of sponsors and
affiliates or alongside them. The only thing that’s easier and faster than setting up a
tournament on Yamzu is collecting payments, which are distributed automatically (via
Smart Contracts) in proportion to the results of the tournament. Exploiting Yamzu’s
platform, sponsors can also create their own events, with their own brand and they
do not have to worry about the logistics and payouts of the winnings. Yamzu’s
automated system will take care of all these burdensome aspects. Gamers will be
able to play without fear of not being compensated for their efforts and sponsors will
gain access to a much broader audience.

5. Points of Strength




5. Points of Strenght
As a one-stop shop for eSports tournaments, Yamzu follows in the footsteps of
platforms of the like of Twitch and Steam, places situated at the crossroads of multiple
revenue streams. In addition, we plan to offer advanced tools (e.g. tokens) which
will greatly simplify monetization for our users. To achieve this ambitious objective,
Yamzu has structured a series of processes that were deemed necessary to ensure
speed, efficiency and ease of use of the platform. The following section highlights
these processes that are empowered and upgraded thanks to the introduction of
Blockchain technology:
Automaticity
The primary focus of Yamzu is to provide players with a completely new
avenue to regularly participate in eSports events. The Yamzu platform cuts
out the middle-man, without requiring a third party to monitor the outcome
of contests. Moreover, the winners are not required to send screenshots or
any other proof of victory. Yamzu automatically pinpoints the winners and
awards them with the prizes. In fact, results update in real time so that all the
interested parties can review the statistics of the match without any delay.
By adopting the tokens and adapting the system already in place to include
Blockchain features, Yamzu will be able to provide an even more reliable
service to its customers as well as reducing costs and increasing transaction
speed.
Monetization
Yamzu wishes to create an environment where gamers can play freely and
can monetize their efforts. Gamers can organize matches or tournaments and
invite only their friends or leave the contests open to the public.
The platform tracks statistics both in real time and   over the course of weeks
and months, providing a reliable and fair competitive environment for our
gaming community. Thanks to the introduction of YMZ tokens  (“YMZ” or
“Yamzu token”), players will have access to a reliable mean to store value and
exchange value on our platform. Not only they will be able to earn an income
in YMZ which will have a market value, hence introducing a complete new
feature for eSports   but they will also gain access to a series of features that
can generate additional sources of value (e.g. meeting sponsors, streaming,
purchasing in-game items, increased visibility, etc…).
Sponsorships
Using Yamzu, sponsors and advertisers can opportunistically host gaming
competitions in a matter of minutes and target specific demographics of
consumers (e.g. filtered by country or region). Because it drastically cuts the
costs associated with traditional tournaments, the platform can absorb and
adapt to nearly any advertising budget.
25




Becoming a sponsor on Yamzu will enable companies of any size to reach
an already established gamers base, therefore avoiding the several costs
associated with acquiring and securing an audience.
Setting up an event is completely free of charge and the only fee due to Yamzu
will be paid upon completion of the tournament and will be derived directly
from the entry fees paid by the participants. Sponsors can decide to organize
the tournament completely on their own or they can rely on Yamzu’s expertise
to support their project in every aspect.
The onboarding process is very easy and straightforward as denoted by the
following image:
As soon as the onboarding request is forwarded, Yamzu will take the first step
and contact the sponsor, offering our support in every activity to facilitate the
process.
26




Affiliate program
Influencers can use Yamzu exclusively or in conjunction with other platforms.  As
an additional revenue stream, our platform represents an invaluable resource
for influencers looking to reach audiences who might prefer our browser-only
interface. Besides the obvious use case of organizing an event, influencers
can join Yamzu’s affiliate program and receive compensation whenever a new
player who they have previously invited to the platform wins a tournament or
a match.
Affiliates can generate revenue in two ways:
2% of the fee due to Yamzu for each tournament hosted by the affiliate.
2% of all entry fees payed by any person who has registered on Yamzu
thanks to the affiliate’s referral.
Becoming an affiliate on Yamzu gives streamers/influencers the perfect tool
to capitalize on their reputation/public image to earn an additional source
of revenue that was otherwise untapped. Moreover, a symbiotic beneficial
relationship will be established between the affiliate and Yamzu: The more
people the influencer can gather to take part to the tournament he/she is
hosting/organizing the more fees he/she will earn and accordingly so will
Yamzu.
The following image presents an example of possible revenue streams for a
Yamzu affiliate:
1. Register on Yamzu
2. Signs up User A & User B
AFFILIATE
5. Creates the prize pool

3. User A logs in                                                                   175 YMZ
and creates game

4. User B logs in and
                                                                                    7. Automatically pays:

                                                                                    Winner - User B (175 YMZ)
fee 100 YMZ
USER B                                                                              Yamzu - 12% Fee (17.5 YMZ)
27




Community
Yamzu will combine elements of social and competitive gaming into what we
have tested to be a unique gaming experience for all parties involved. Yamzu
is creating a strong community in which players can enjoy a superior gaming
experience whilst also having access to a successful way to monetize the
time they have invested into their passion. Moreover, we believe the creation
of such a virtuous system will encourage players to unite and generate a
safe and respectful community where everyone can share their views and
communicate with sponsors and and amongst themselves other without any
external interference.

6. Technology




6. Technology
Core elements
Yamzu points
The Yamzu Point is the platform’s currency as of today. Players can obtain Yamzu
Points in two ways:
Make deposits in fiat currencies and exchange it into Yamzu Points
(e.g. 1 EUR = 100 YP).
Through achievements (e.g. referring a friend, winning a contest, etc…).
After obtaining a sufficient amount of Yamzu Points, players can utilize them to
redeem prizes (e.g. Steam and Amazon gift cards).
From a Centralised System to a Smart Contract System
Yamzu’s website is currently regulated by a centralized system that oversees every
function available on the platform. It has been designed to be fast and efficient
hence guaranteeing our users the best gaming experience on the market. From the
users’ registration process to the exact pinpointing of the winner of an event, Yamzu’s
powerful system has been effective and more importantly loved by our players. Even
though Yamzu’s centralized system has been powerful enough so far, newly emerged
technologies (e.g. Blockchain) have created new decentralized systems that may
be more effective in serving our customers. Therefore, Yamzu did not remain idle,
but instead embraced these new cutting-edge technologies, starting with the
introduction of a new currency, the Yamzu token.
Organic and simple change
With the adoption of the Yamzu token, Yamzu’s official currency will shift from the
Yamzu Point to the YMZ. The token will enable players to bypass several issues such
as payment barriers (at least for some regions), credit card fees and other bank
fees. What’s even more appealing, the token will also permit players to create and
maintain their own cryptocurrency wallets and thus unlock a variety of withdrawal
possibilities that are completely unavailable on current platforms.
The coin’s sustainable growth is ensured by the anchor of Yamzu-branded contests
with larger prize pools than typical tournaments. Thus players are incentivized to buy
more Yamzu tokens, which in turn will fuel the platform’s economic growth.
Upon gaining access to Yamzu tokens, players can trade the value they have earned
on the platform for open-market international branding, making eSports more viable
than ever as a career for both new and experienced gamers.
30




Sponsors will be able to use YMZ not only to distribute prize pools, but also to sell
their merchandise. Through specialized demographic targeting, these entities can
strengthen their brands by choosing to host events which best suit their respective
business models.
Token implementation - Timeline
90-120 days following the Token Sale
Yamzu will shift from YP (Yamzu Points) to YMZ (Yamzu tokens) that will es-             1.
sentially empower players by providing them with many new ways to utilize
the currency. All transactions on the new Yamzu platform will be conducted
through YMZ and no other currency will be accepted. Yamzu has estimated
the implementation of the new currency will take between 3 and 4 months,
given the complexity of the process. In the meantime, gamers will be able to
continue playing with the current features without any disruption from Yam-
zu’s end until the new system is operational and ready to be deployed.
Yamzu will open its platform to sponsors and affiliates to transact value               2.
through such methods as advertising and promotion and to take full advan-
tage of the introduction of the tokens. The open trade of YMZ for sponsors
and affiliates will provide them with new ways to attract more players and to
organize events. Because all events on the platform will occur within the onli-
ne browser, users of all experience levels will experience next to no friction in
the transaction of value on Yamzu.
Note: Sponsors can already utilize the platform as of today. This is just from a
marketing perspective.

7. Yamzu on Blockchain
An overview on Blockchain and Smart Contracts
An important milestone in the cyptocurrencies world has been reached with the
development and deployment to the public of the Ethereum Blockchain, on the 30th
of July 2015.
Vitalik Buterin managed to take an important first step in a world which in just a short
time ago recognized Bitcoin as the sole relevant benchmark for the market. To gain
a better understanding of what makes Ethereum so innovative and disruptive, we
should take a step back and remember that one of the major benefits of Blockchain
technology is indeed the possibility of eliminating, from any given transaction, the
third “trusted” party and therefore allowing two “trustless” individuals to exchange
value in complete confidence and security.
This level of confidence is justifiable since  Blockchain is the technology that supports
the complete decentralization of all operations that run through its system which
are consequently registered on its virtual ledger. Every person in possession of this
technology acts as a user as well as a guarantor of what has happened in the past
and what is happening in the immediate present.
The potential of this technology is expressed by what is commonly referred to as
“decentralized ledger”. It has been defined as “decentralized” because every user of
the technology can access the entire ledger, containing all transactions that have
occurred from the creation of the Blockchain up to that specific moment. The ledger
is in fact updated in real time as new transactions are added to the chain.  Bitcoin’s
ledger and relative registered transactions date back to 2009, whereas the ones
captured by Ethereum date back to 2015.
The security of this technology resides in its decentralizations properties: the more
the level of adoption of the Blockchain increases, the more the ledgers are shared,
exactly duplicated and made available, the more the ledger will be airtight and
“trustless”. It is defined as “trustless” because the verification of the truthfulness of
a transaction is obtained based on the number of consensus that are confirmed by
the system as the transaction is read by more nodes of the network. (A node is the
hardware system, usually a PC, that holds the entire Blockchain ledger).
Ethereum indeed shares the same features as its predecessor Bitcoin, which is to say
the decentralized ledger, but moreover introduces in 2015 an entirely new concept:
The Smart Contracts. Up until that moment the only operations executable on the
Blockchain were very similar to bank transactions of debit/credit: simple transactions
that registered the change in ownership of the value of the relative cryptocurrency.
The Smart Contract (for simplicity SC) has made possible and continues to makes
possible even today the execution of more complex actions, achievable at the
materialization of certain conditions, without any need for human intervention apart
from its creation and deployment on the Blockchain.
33




From the Blockchain the SC has inherited:
A decentralized system.
A secure system.
A system that can act as an impartial third party.
At present the Smart Contracts have been expressed to their full potential in two
specific cases: Decentralized Exchange Platforms (valid examples are ForkDelta and
EtherData) and the ludic application “Crypto Kitties”. In both cases the interaction
between users and between user and platform, is implemented through a Smart
Contract without any human intervention, apart in the form of the direct use of the
platform itself.
Yamzu Token (YMZ)
How can Yamzu benefit form decentralization being it a eSports   platform that is
already active and functioning?
Currently Yamzu’s core activities can be divided into three macro areas:
Payments denominated in fiat currencies.
Prizes in Yamzu Points.
In-platform purchases in Yamzu Points.
Future  Blockchain  implementations  carried  out  by  Yamzu  will  include  the
transformation of the first two macro areas. Players will have access to a mini-internal
exchange where they will be able to exchange fiat currencies in Yamzu tokens which
will be needed for every in-platform transaction. Thereafter, the following features
will be implemented on our platform:
Exchange to swap fiat currency with YMZ.
Prize pools pay-outs in YMZ.
YMZ utilized to redeem prizes or to be exchanged on the market for fiat currency.
The second macro area of interest, “Prize pool distribution in YMZ” will entail the
all-around involvement of Etherem’s Blockchain and the implementation of Smart
Contracts  to  ensure  the  successful  management  of  post  -  game  events  with
consequent winnings pay-outs.
34




Game Model on Blockchain
As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, Ethereum, through its Blockchain, has
permitted the introduction and the deployment of SC to ensure the management
and successful execution of forecastable events or to act only if certain conditions
are met. The case presented from the management of eSports  events is the perfect
example of a mechanism that can be upgraded to construct a “trustless” system.
To manage the processes linked to the introduction of the tokens, Yamzu will link the
account of every player to a wallet that is ERC-20 compliant. This newly formed link
will make sure that every transaction deriving from the payment of winnings will be
executed far more fluidly and with enhanced user experience.
The functionality of the YMZ tokens (inside the gaming platform) can be described
through the following phases:
Phase 1
Player A and B decide to play a 1v1 match of CS:GO. They both pay for the creation
of the custom tournament and the entry fee in YMZ and they send the tokens to the
Smart Contract which gathers all the fees in its ledger.
The event is therefore written on the Blockchain in a permanent and exclusive manner.
Alternative scenario 1b
Player A and B do not yet hold any YMZ and they can easily purchase them through
the exchange directly from Yamzu’s platform.
Once YMZ have been purchased, the two players can spend them to create or to take
part in the tournament on the platform, therefore falling under the same scenario as
the one presented in phase (1).
Player A
Player B
35




Phase 2
At the end of the match, hence at the completion of the action one of the two
players, A or B, must be crowned winner of the game. In this case, Yamzu’s server,
already geared to manage this type of event automatically, will give the choice to
the winner, through the interface, to “redeem” the win and receive the consequent
winnings.
Player A
Player B
At this point, after the “redeem” button has been clicked, Yamzu’s server signs and
hence authorizes the transaction to the SC for the release of the amount of YMZ to
the victor.
Alternative scenarios 2b
There are not many possible alternative scenarios to  2b since it is technically
impossible for more than one player participating in the same game to disconnect
at the same exact time, even if they are using the same internet connection.
36




In the following table potential scenarios and their solutions are presented:
Possible scenario                                                                            Server Yamzu   Smart Contract action
The game is interrupted because of a technical issue                                         Null           The entry fees are returned
of the platform                                                                                             (no Yamzu Fee)
The game is interrupted because of the disconnection                                         Victory        The prize pool is paid the player/ team
of one of the players or of the other team                                                                  still online (- Yamzu Fee)
In cases that have not been envisaged or because they require the intervention of an
external referee, given by Yamzu’s staff which would guarantee the regular progress
of gaming procedures as well as the payment procedures.
Internal Exchange - Unidirectional: Fiat Currency      Token
The construction of an internal exchange embedded into Yamzu’s platform will enable
users to convert fiat money into tokens, hence allowing users still not in possession
of any YMZ to pay for the entry fees necessary to gain access to tournaments or
matches that would otherwise be inaccessible to them. In this regard, Yamzu will
allocate a percentage of the tokens issued as funds to be utilised and exchanged
inside the platform. Therefore, Yamzu will behave, through its wallet, like an internal
clearing-house.
The exchange platform will facilitate players, but also Yamzu in its ability to provide
an additional service to its users by giving them the opportunity to purchase some
YMZ and start playing without any delay.
The exchange will accept payments directly from credit cards or PayPal services.
The value, or better the counter-value of the YMZ purchasable directly from the
platform, will be linked to the daily quotation in real time through an API that will read
the average price of the token on the relevant exchange platforms and precisely
report it on Yamzu’s website.
To avoid arbitrage schemes on the token’s price, a minimum level of spread will be
applied. This will cover the collection expenses due to payment circuits (e.g. Visa,
Mastercard, etc…) or to PayPal services.
37




Burning Mechanism
Yamzu will implement a burning mechanism to ensure the value of the token will
remain elevated. This mechanism entails that 5% of the tokens received by Yamzu as
fee for each tournament will be burned.
Example:
User A wins a game and is entitled to 200 YMZ.
Yamzu’s fee is 12.5%, therefore (200 x 12.5%) 25 YMZ.
5% will be burned, therefore (25 x 5%) 1.25 YMZ.
Yamzu will receive (25 - 1.25) 23.75 YMZ as fee.
User A will receive (200 - 25) 175 YMZ as winning.
38




“Hodl” of Yamzu Tokens - A staking reward mechanism
In the cryptocoin community it is often described as “holding” or rather “hodling”,
term coined from a thread written on Bitcointalk in 2013 caused by a misprint in the
text: Hodl instead of hold. This word “hodl” has been thereafter utilized as acronym
for “Hold On for Dear Life”.
Why “hodling” Yamzu tokens?
Yamzu reflected on how to best protect investors taking part to the Token Sale from
potential negative price swings determined by the under-priced (in respect to the
ICO price) sale of tokens that could be executed by players and teams that would
have earned tokens at the end of each game.  Players/teams will be in possession of
tokens obtained for “free”, hence not payed for with money, but with time dedicated
to playing on the platform. Therefore, they would perhaps be more inclined to sell the
tokens on the market to monetize their winnings.
The best way to prevent this type of behaviour is to encourage each player as well
as each contributor vested in the ICO to hold the tokens in an ERC20 wallet, so that
the YMZ can generate an augmented revenue stream deriving from prize winnings
for both interested parties.
At the end of each game, the server will check the YMZ balance for each players and
based on the corresponding amount of Yamzu tokens available it will establish the
value of the “Bonus” of the winnings following the scheme illustrated below:
This mechanism will be implemented
Wallet Balance (YMZ)                                                                     Bonus
precisely   to   stimulate   purchasing

and staking of Yamzu tokens and to

                                                                                                 discourage mass sell-off of the YMZ

                                                                                                 that could cause the price to drop

8. Yamzu - putting trust back
into eSports




8. Yamzu - putting trust back
into eSports.
Today, when you win an eSports competition you have to trust that the sponsor or
organizer will pay out the prize money promised. Unfortunately, this does not always
happen. One of the biggest problems in eSports today is the fraudulent payout of
prizes. Winning players can be left with nothing.
With blockchain-enabled smart contracts, the Yamzu platform will ensure that
winners get the prizes they are promised. Blockchains are distributed databases that
are secure without third parties. Cryptocurrencies, digital money built on blockchains,
mean we can now trade and exchange value without worrying that a single coin
can be used twice. For this reason, blockchains are called ‘trustless’, which really
means that people can transact without needing to be able to trust that the other
is acting in good faith. When you receive a coin, you, and you alone receive it. There
is no way for it to be sent anywhere else or for the sender to retract the payment.
Smart Contracts take this one step further and allow us to automate irreversible
transactions, meaning payments can be initiated only once certain conditions are
satisfied.
Yamzu puts trust back into eSports with an ERC-20 token combined with Ethereum
Smart Contracts. This way we can automate and secure all phases of the award
payment procedure.
Here’s how it works:
Prizes for competitions must be deposited into the Yamzu smart contract by the
1
participants  in  YMZ  (Yamzu  tokens).  Once  received,  the  smart  contract  sends
verification to the Yamzu platform that the funds are held securely in escrow, and
only once this is satisfied can the competition take place.
After the match has completed, the Yamzu platform receives the results from our
2
secure game servers via custom RESTful APIs written in Node.js. This makes the data
imposible to tamper with or falsify. We currently offer eSports services for CS:GO and
LoL, and are developing secure RESTful APIs for additional titles which we will rollout
in Q1 2019 (see roadmap).
The platform pushes the results of the match to the Yamzu smart contract, which
3
receives and verifies the data. The verification of the results satisfies the conditions of
the Yamzu smart contact, and the funds held are released into the ERC-20 compliant
wallet of the winning player or team. Payments can never bounce or be reversed.
The winner is then able to use the YMZ funds as they wish, using it to organize their
4
own Yamzu matches and tournaments, or trading it for a fiat currency like USD or EUR
on an exchange.

9. Token Model




9. Token Model
The token model has been developed to estimate the optimal number of tokens to
be issued and to ensure an adequate level of liquidity and token adoption inside the
Yamzu community.
The token model has been based on the following parameters of estimation:
N° of games available.
N° of Active Users.
User Base Growth Rate.
Token functionality (Outflow, Inflow and Retained).
Token Price discovery
The price of the YMZ token has been set upon the criteria of Users preference.
Based on the most recent market researches, it has transpired that most gamers
utilizing online gaming platforms would rather receive substantial quantities of game
credits, with a lower relative value instead of holding a fewer number of game credits
with a higher relative value.
Therefore, it has been estimated that the optimal price for YMZ is equal to:
1                                                                                        =   0.1
Token monetary base estimate
The total supply of tokens (i.e. the number of tokens to be distributed through the
platform) has been estimated on the following two parameters: The Number of Users
and the User Base Growth Rate.

10. Token Functionality




10. Token Functionality
The YMZ tokens will be obtainable by winning tournaments, completing daily/
weekly/monthly quests or by transfer among players (e.g. Donations).
To estimate the optimal number of tokens to be issued aiming to maintain a sufficient
level of liquidity inside a self-sustaining ecosystem, the tokens have been divided
into three categories:
Outflow - Tokens.
Inflow - Tokens.
Retained - Tokens.
Outflow - Tokens
This category refers to the tokens that will flow from Yamzu’s reserve of YMZ to the
users of the platform. In particular, it includes tokens that will be utilized for tournament
organisation and for rewars system. Outlined below are the processes specific to the
outflow tokens:
Yamzu’s Organized Tournaments
Yamzu will organize tournaments to engage new players, to promote specific events
or just for the sake of bolstering competition amongst its users. By providing the
prize pool, Yamzu will enable even amateurs to participate in tournaments otherwise
inaccessible to a player of their skill level. The funds will be provided directly from
Yamzu’s dedicated reserve of YMZ tokens, therefore making access to the tournament
free of charge for all the participants.
The winners of the tournament will be rewarded directly and exclusively in YMZ tokens
through the execution of Smart Contracts.
The size of the tournament, the number of allowed participants and the size of the
prize pool will vary depending on the unique purpose of the tournament and will be
specified beforehand by Yamzu.
The following image represents the flow of the tokens in a scenario where a tourna-
ment is organized by Yamzu:
LEGEND:                                                                                         SC actions   Organizer actions   Players actions
46




Sponsored Tournaments
Sponsors can handily set up their own events through Yamzu’s platform. They will
contact Yamzu and request the purchase of YMZ to be used as prize pool for the
tournament in exchange for a fiat amount of their choosing.
The sponsors can set-up the tournament free of charge without having to rent an
expensive location and incur in all the associated costs. They can simply open an
account on Yamzu and start organising their own events.
Sponsors are free to decide how many players will take part to the completion, their
required skill level, the location of provenance, etc…
The distribution of the prize pool to the winners of the tournament will be implemented
and overseen entirely by Yamzu’s SC, therefore relieving the sponsor of this burdening
and risky procedure.
The following image represents the flow of the tokens in a scenario where a tourna-
ment is organized by a sponsoring company:
LEGEND:                                                                                   SC actions   Organizer actions   Players actions
47




Quests
To reward players actively utilizing our platform, a series of quests have been
implemented:
E-mail Validation                                                                        >
By simply linking your Yamzu’s account to an e-mail address and after
having successively validated it, the user will receive tokens as a bonus
for having completed the process.
Daily quest                                                                              >
Play two games.
Win one game.
Weekly quest                                                                             >
Play five games.
Win three games.
Monthly                                                                                  >
Play twenty games.
Win ten games.
Best Winnin Streak
The player that has won the most consecutive amount of games at the end of each
day will receive some YMZ tokens as bonus.
Leaderboard - Top Positions
To boost competition, Yamzu thought of providing tokens as rewards for those players
who always aim for the top and through their dedication and skills are able to reach
the top positions on Yamzu’s Leaderboard.
The  Leaderboard  positions  will  depend  upon  a  series  of  parameters  that  will
establish the overall top 10 players for each game available on Yamzu’s platform.
These amazing athletes will receive bonus YMZ depending on their position at the
end of each month.
48




Hall of Fame
Yamzu has set up a Hall of Fame containing different rewards on a monthly basis.
This feature has been designed to reward not only the best players but also the most
dedicated, those who spend a lot of time on our platform.
Yamzu’s Hall of Fame will include the following rewards:
The Hall of Fame has been structured as follows:
Rookie of the month.
Most wins in a month.
Most games played.
Most YMZ tokens won in a month.
Refer a Friend
Yamzu always compensates the efforts of its users, especially when these efforts are
dedicated to sponsoring our platform. This system of referral has been structured to
include a maximum number of 5 referrals.
The user, after having validated the e-mail address, can “refer a friend” and receive
as a reward a certain amount of YMZ per new user. To be able to receive the reward
the new user will have to play at least 10 games.
This limit has been implemented to avoid the creation of accounts for purely
speculative purposes.
49




Inflow - Tokens
This category refers to the tokens that will flow from the users into Yamzu’s reserve.
It concerns tokens purchased with the distinct purpose of completing the three
specific actions stated in the following paragraph. This category of tokens has been
designed to insure a satisfactory level of liquidity in the ecosystem.
Player Organized Matches/Tournaments
The main advantage of Yamzu’s platform lies in the ability to empower players by
giving them freedom to create and organize their own matches/tournaments. The
creation of a match/tournament is easy and straightforward.
The organizing player sets up:
Type of game (CS:GO, LoL, etc…).
Server.
Date and time.
Number of players/teams.
Tournament/match format (Single game, tournament, etc…).
Number of players.
Entry Fee.
The entry fee is decided by the organising player and the creation of the prize pool
is automatic and is generated by a Smart Contract that effortlessly merges the
entrance fees from all of the participants. The fees are also automatically sent from
the players’ wallets to Yamzu’s wallet until the completion of the tournament.
The winners will receive 85% of the prize pool.
12.5% or 15% (depending on the number of players) of all entry fees will go to  Yamzu
as payment for providing the service.
A Burning Mechanism has been implemented to burn 5% of the fee received  by
Yamzu.
Following an example of possible pay-outs:
Upon completion of the contest, the winners
Prize pool creation/pay-out

The following image represents the flow of the tokens in a scenario in which a
tournament is organized among player and there is only a single winner:
Steam gift cards purchase
Another function of the inflow tokens will be represented by the possibility for the
users to purchase Steam gift cards in exchange for YMZ tokens. Steam gift cards
can then be utilized by players to purchase whatever they prefer on Steam (e.g.
Characters skins, new games, etc…).
Amazon gift cards purchase
YMZ tokens earned by the players in the platform can furthermore be exchanged for
Amazon gift cards to later be spent on Amazon on whatever the users see fit.
Retained - Tokens
This category refers to the tokens that will be freely exchanged among players.
In-Game Donations
Through Yamzu platform’s cutting-edge technology, players will be able to donate a
voluntary number of YMZ to other players at the end of each game. Thanks to these
feature players will have access to a means by which reward other players directly.
Off-Game Donations
In addition, donations can be carried out outside the lobby environment. Followers/
viewers can donate YMZ to their favourite players and streamers by simply clicking
a button. This will also enable top players to receive funds directly into their Yamzu
wallets without having to rely on third parties to process the donations. This system
will generate incentives for both the player  (obtain donations faster and more
securely) and the follower/viewer.

11. Token Sale




11. Token Sale
Every transaction on the platform, after the introduction of the tokens, will involve
the use of Yamzu tokens.
The YMZ will be the only currency accepted as payment by the Smart Contracts
operating Yamzu’s platform.
The issuance of Yamzu tokens will be limited to the Token Sale (also known as TGE
event - Token Generation Event). After their conclusion no more YMZ will ever be
generated.

Follow-up
Influencer Marketing
The number one marketing tool in the eSports’ business is influencer marketing.
eSports enthusiasts frequently follow their favorite e-athletes, blogs, and websites
on a daily basis. We plan to reach out to gaming and gaming-related channels in
order to increase our brand recognition and attract the attention of more gamers.
We will be reaching out to the following entities specifically to enhance Yamzu’s
image via social media:
eSports  teams.
Gaming clubs.
Companies and organizations.
Professional gamers.
Streamers.
YouTube personalities.
Facebook pages.
Cyber-cafes.
As we continue to grow and our marketing budget increases, we will continue to
seek out more social media accounts to connect with in order to promote events on
Yamzu, a process which also endorses the engine itself.
Sponsors
In today’s eSports  environment, the only brands which can afford to sponsor events
are huge names in the gaming and gaming-related industries. Yamzu will provide
a platform for small- and medium-size brands to host big events with little, if any,
investment.
Even a major tournament will be free for a brand to arrange, and we will even
help these brands market their events so the word will get out to participants. This
platform represents a golden opportunity for small businesses to compete with and
even outpace larger companies whose budgets are vastly superior.

General Information
In order to fund the development of the YAMZU ecosystem, tokens will be sold to
the public in exchange for cryptocurrencies. The YMZ Token is a coin, which will
allow the user to access the services provided on the YAMZU platform. Users that
intend to purchase YMZ Token are subject to the acceptance of the General Terms &
Conditions. The YMZ Token does not have the legal qualification of a security, since it
does not give any rights to dividends or interests. The sale of YMZ Tokens is final and
non-refundable. YMZ Tokens are not shares and do not give any right to participate
to the general meeting of YAMZU Sweden AB. YMZ Tokens cannot have a performance
or a particular value outside the YAMZU Platform. YMZ Tokens shall therefore not
be used or purchased for speculative or investment purposes. YMZ Tokens will not
be listed on any regulated stock exchange. This Whitepaper nor any other material
relating to the Offer, YAMZU Platform or YMZ Tokens, has ever been or ever will be
filed with regard to legal standards such as the Federal Act on Stock Exchanges
and Securities Trading law, the Financial Market Infrastructure Act, or the Collective
Investment Schemes Act, which are not applicable to this token sale. Therefore, laws
and acts that ensure that investors are sold investments that include all the proper
disclosures and are subject to regulatory scrutiny for the investors’ protection, are
not applicable in this case. Every purchaser of the YMZ Token should seek proper
advice in order to understand whether the purchase of the Token is appropriate for
them or not. Anyone purchasing YMZ Tokens expressly acknowledges and represents
that she/he has carefully reviewed this Whitepaper and fully understands the risks,
costs, and benefits associated with the purchase of YMZ Token.
Knowledge Required
The  purchaser  of  YMZ  Tokens  undertakes  that  she/he  understands  and  has
significant experience of cryptocurrencies, Blockchain systems, and services, and
that she/he fully understands the risks associated with crowd-sale as well as the
mechanism related to the use of cryptocurrencies (incl. storage). YAMZU AB shall not
be responsible for any loss of YMZ Tokens, or situations making it impossible to access
YMZ Tokens, which may result from any actions or omissions of the user, or any person
undertaking the acquisition of YMZ Tokens, as well as in case of hacker attacks.
Risks
Prior to acquiring YMZ Tokens, any user should carefully consider the risks, costs and
benefits of acquiring YMZ Tokens in the context of the crowd-sale and, if necessary,
obtain independent advice in this regard.
Any interested person who is not in a position to accept or to understand the risks
associated with the activity (incl. the risks related to the non-development of the
YAMZU platform) or any other risks as indicated in the Terms & Conditions of the
crowd-sale, should not acquire YMZ Tokens.

be used as an investment.
The offering of YMZ Tokens on a trading platform is done in order to allow the use of
the YAMZU platform and not for speculative purposes. The offering of YMZ Tokens
on a trading platform does not change the legal qualification of the tokens, which
remain a simple means for the use of the YAMZU platform and are not a security.

matters.
Any information in the Whitepaper is provided for general information purposes
only and YAMZU Sweden AB does not provide any warranty as to the accuracy and
completeness of this information. YAMZU Sweden AB is not a financial intermediary

Acquiring YMZ Tokens shall not grant any right or influence over YAMZU’s organization
and governance to the Purchasers.
Regulatory  authorities  are  carefully  scrutinizing  businesses  and  operations
associated with cryptocurrencies in the world. In that respect, regulatory measures,
investigations or actions may impact YAMZU Sweden AB business and even limit or
prevent it from developing its operations in the future. Any person undertaking to
acquire YMZ Tokens must be aware that the YAMZU Sweden AB business model, the
Whitepaper, or Terms & Conditions may change or need to be modified because of
new regulatory and compliance requirements according to any applicable laws in
any jurisdictions. In such a case, purchasers and anyone undertaking to acquire YMZ
Tokens acknowledge and understand that neither YAMZU Sweden AB nor any of its
affiliates shall be held liable for any direct or indirect loss or damage caused by such
changes.
They acknowledge and understand therefore that YAMZU Sweden AB (incl. its bodies
and employees) assumes no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage that
would result from, or relate to, the incapacity to use YMZ Tokens, except in case of
intentional misconduct or gross negligence.
