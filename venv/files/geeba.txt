EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
DISRUPTING URBAN
MOBILITY AND LOGISTICS
The “last-mile” in the delivery industry is the final
segment of the parcel delivery journey where
parcels are transported from a distribution hub
or warehouse to the end-consumer’s location.
It’s an expensive and resource-intensive part of
parcel delivery. Therefore, Geeba is a decentralized
delivery ecosystem that enables businesses to
operate deliveries with autonomous vehicles and
smart hubs. The high costs, lack of efficiency,
and demand of deliveries today enables Geeba
to introduce a new approach to the industry by
allowing the community to actively participate in
the evolution through leveraging blockchain.
Geeba, bringing a smile to delivery.

SMART HUBS
Sustainable and low cost
design that is city friendly
and extremely functional.
Geeba utilizes available parking space in
specific public and accessible location to station
the Smart Hubs with variable sizes. The dual-
purpose hub functions as storage space for
parcels and a charging station for parked
robots. It’s designed to automatically manage
and store up to 40 standard size packages with
option of landing pads for drone to load and
unload packages. Each is designed on the
thought of recycling used shipping containers
within a standard car parking stall. The standard
parallel stall size for on-street parking shall be a
minimum 6m long by 2.5m wide.

Geeba envisions a future
where autonomous
vehicles including drones
will deliver close to 100%
of X2C and 80% of all
items.
Only ~ 2% will be delivered by bike couriers
in the relatively small instant delivery
segment. Traditional delivery will account for
the remaining ~ 20% of all items: big B2B
customers with high drop factors (i.e., the
number of parcels dropped per stop/ recipient)
and often special delivery requirements (e.g.,
hanging goods) will favor mostly human
delivery as we know it today. The same is true
for e-grocery delivery, as people will still want
crates to be carried up to their apartments and
returns to be handled directly.
