Executive Summary
Cloudwith.me (the “Company”) has three main objectives:
1)  To  decentralize  the  provisioning  of  cloud  services,  migrating  from  a  global  infrastructure
operated by a small group of hyperscale service providers to a blockchain-based peer-to-peer
infrastructure  operated  by  millions  of  small  individual  providers  and  contributors  of  cloud
resources.
2)  To  simplify  the  use  of  professional cloud services for all levels of web users turning such
services  into  a  commodity  product that is universally accessible and utilized by the general
public.
3)  To monetize the new decentralized cloud services ecosystem with a dedicated cryptocurrency
governed by a smart contract enabling  automated and trusted reconciliation of payments between
all peer-to-peer cloud services providers.
The Company has already achieved the first milestone by establishing its simplified provisioning and
setup of cloud services that can be easily operated by even the most novice web users.
As a second phase, Cloudwith.me intends to facilitate the creation of a globally decentralized cloud
hosting grid, allowing cloud-based applications to automatically scale across millions of cloud service
providers who are in fact individuals contributing small portions of their redundant home/office computer
resources to become a part of the blockchain cloud grid (thus effectively creating the new Crowd Cloud)
and benefiting from continuous Provider income.

The  blockchain  Ethereum-based  Cloud  token  is  intended  to  become  the  standard  currency  for  the
emergent  decentralized  cloud  services  ecosystem,  governing  contribution-based  pro-rata  payments,
clearing and distribution of financial benefits to the new role players of the Crowd Cloud.
On a naive schematic level, each cloud service is comprised of the following building blocks: (1) Storage
(2) Computing/Processing (3) Bandwidth (4) Cloud Applications (5) Payments and billing
High-level schematic of the building blocks of an average cloud service
By encapsulating the basic building blocks of the cloud service (namely a “GridNode”) and creating a
smart contract that considers the key aspects of the relationship between a cloud-service provider and
application providers, the Company intends to make it possible for virtually anyone to join the hosting
grid as a service provider/contributor, thereby establishing a virtual infrastructure that is operated by
millions  of  cloud-service  providers  across  the  globe,  and  making  it  possible  for  each  cloud-based
application to elastically scale to nodes that meet its own technical, geographic, regulatory and business
requirements.
The newly issued Cloud cryptocoin will be used to automatically distribute payments to the GridNode
owners  and  other  Crowd  Cloud  participating  parties  as  well  as  to  provide  important  Grid  Admin
facilitation such as entity description, performance metrics, etc.
The Company intends to use the proceeds from the ICO to deploy a critical mass of GridNodes on a
global  scale  and  actively  promote  the  recruitment  of  GridNode  Service Providers/Contributors thus
effectively decentralizing cloud services.

The key benefits expected from achieving cloud decentralization are:
●   Reduction of cloud services costs (expected circa 94% cost reduction on average service criteria)
●   Unparalleled data security and privacy with tamper-proof GridNode network components
●   Near fail-safe operation with significantly higher integrity and service availability
●   High degree of cloud services automation enabling to deal with the “What” instead of the “How”
●   Taking pro-cloud services out of the IT expertise zone making it fully accessible for the “rest of
us” by utilizing the Company’s blockchain DAP technology
The DAP, or Decentralized Application Protocol, is a blockchain application threading layer. Based on
the Ethereum infrastructure, the DAP will facilitate easy design and launch decentralized peer-to-peer
cloud applications such as media services (music & film), social peer-to-peer insurance, decentralized
banking,  financial  services  and  other  applications  without  limitations  or  central  governance—all
monetised by a single uniform currency—the Cloud token. The protocol will allow seamless setup of
self-governing smart contracts for an unlimited range of social applications.
The Cloud token is a key component governing the financial ecosystem surrounding the new Crowd
Cloud. The Company believes Cloud Token is expected to gain significant liquidity due to its immediate
implementation in the Company’s services.

Centralized Cloud Services Overview
The 21st century has seen a massive surge in data and cloud applications economy. The demand for both
storing  and  processing  data  is on an exponential rise  [1]. The cost of cloud services for small and
medium-sized businesses (SMBs & SOHO) become significant as the need to develop and deploy cloud
applications becomes an essential commodity.
Software  applications  that  offer  remote  storage  have  been  made  accessible  to  compensate  for  the
limitations of on-premises computer storage. However, the real players in this industry—the ‘hyperscale’
cloud services providers—go well beyond the scope of mere storage. Centralized cloud service providers
offer a wide array of services including storage, backup, web hosting, remote computing power, content
delivery, database management and remote software applications.
Over 90% of businesses utilize cloud services in some form, benefiting from a range of cloud applications
management and analytics without the upfront investments necessary on infrastructure, specialty staffing,
server equipment and maintenance. The rise of cloud services has been one of the strongest influencers on
a five-year low of capital expenditure in IT budgets [2]. While capital expenditures of businesses are
being significantly reduced, Intel Security predicts that by mid-2018, operational expenditure for cloud
services will account for 80% of IT budgets [3] and IDC forecasts global public cloud services to reach
over $195 billion in revenues by 2020, more than doubling last year’s figure [4].

For smaller businesses scalability is key. Investment in virtual servers via cloud services endows clients
with scalable server capacity, so that a high number of server instances can be utilized during peak
demand,  and  a  lower  amount  during  quiet  periods.  This way, wasted server capacity doesn’t drain
company resources and server time can be costed on a pay-per-use schema.
Centralized cloud services rely on a number of large data centers to serve their customer base. These data
centers are physically segregated to avoid total service failure wherever possible. While providers offer
services  that  enable  customers  to  run  instances  on multiple server systems to balance traffic, these
ultimately come at an additional cost as insurance in case of system failure in one data center. The
reliance on physically connected local server systems is precisely what’s meant when it is said that their
services are ‘centralized’. Users of centralized cloud services must place significant amount of trust in
their providers to be secure, accessible and reliable.
The Synergy Research Group reported in 2017 that the top 24 hyperscale companies currently operate
over 300 data centers around the world. They also report that hyperscale providers account for 68% of the
global market share for cloud infrastructure services and 59% of cloud-hosted software services [5]. For
these hyperscale providers, cloud services are accounting for an increasing percentage of their revenue.
Cisco reported in 2015 that hyperscale data center traffic accounted for 34% of total Internet traffic, a
figure expected to rise to 53% by 2020 [6].
It’s  no  surprise  that  the  only  competition  in  the cloud service industry is between well-established
corporations  as  the  cost  of  setting  up  a  viable  centralized  cloud  service  is  simply  too  much  for
newcomers.
Many individuals and small businesses struggle with the necessary steps to understand and maintain the
cloud service infrastructure. For businesses in particular, setting up cloud servers can take months of work
by trained professionals. Some managed hosting solutions like Cloudwith.me offer automated solutions to
cloud  service  setup  and  management  removing  barriers  to  cloud  services  setup  and  allowing  such
businesses to remain focused on their core operations.
A 2014 study by IDC found that 65% of SMBs worldwide made use of cloud storage, with the main
disincentive being privacy and security concerns  [7]. Security concerns have been a highly discussed
issue  for  potential  users  of  cloud  services                                                                  (especially  cloud  storage)  since  their popularization  [8].
Rightfully so, it would seem. Nearly 60% of SMBs go out of business within six months of a hack [9].

ֿWhat is  Blockchain?
In 2008 Bitcoin presented an elegant solution to the problems posed by centralized administration in the
finance sector: distributed databases [21]. Using a peer-to-peer architecture, this blockchain technology
allows users to send transactions without a central authority to accommodate them. In this paradigm,
every user of the service holds a copy of all the transactions sent through the network. This eliminates any
need to trust a third party to maintain services or verify transactions. A transaction on a blockchain
service takes place immensely fast and securely.
A blockchain-based system makes use of a blockchain to link a ‘block’ of transactions to the set of all
past  transactions  in  the  system.  Every  user—or  node—in  the  network  is  given  a  full  copy  of the
blockchain. This enforces transparency between users, as each new block on the chain is synchronized
among  all nodes. Each transaction must be verified by a number of users. Verifications are usually
performed by nodes randomly guessing inputs to a cryptographic hash algorithm until the result matches
the hash ID of the last block in the chain.
Despite the transparency of transactions in a blockchain, users are awarded privacy because their identity
to the system is simply a public key (a long number hash). A corresponding private key is used to sign off
transactions.  Users  must  keep the private key private; it is the only means for the system to prove
authenticity. No confidential information on users is held by the blockchain except those details they
decide to send out (which is not recommended).
Users who opt to try to verify transactions make automated verifications. To add incentive to do so, those
that succeed are given a monetary reward. Therefore blockchain technologies allow transactions to be
executed incredibly quickly. The fees for sending transactions through the distributed network are driven
down compared with those in centralized services due to the ease of processing transactions and the
absence  of  a  third  party  to  oversee  the  validity  of  a  contract. If a transaction breaks the terms of
agreement, the contract isn’t valid and it cannot be passed down the chain.
Since  the  advent of Bitcoin, many other cryptocurrencies have been conceived with the same basic
framework. The most notable of these is Ethereum, which generalizes the idea of a blockchain currency to
a contract token that could represent any hard-coded agreement between parties. These ‘smart contracts’
have  been utilized by platforms for crowdfunding, prediction markets  (Gnosis), music licensing and
distribution (Ujo), social media (AKASHA), and even cloud services (Storj, Golem), all at a discount to
similar, centralized services. They are flexible enough for developers to add a wide range of conditions
and  functions based on which conditions are met in deployment. Yet in deployment, this flexibility
vanishes, as their properties become strict terms that must be met by users to decide whether the contract
is valid and precisely what it will be used for.
10




Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of public blockchains. Anyone can access a public blockchain to
view, send, or validate transactions. Private blockchain platforms, on the other hand, require explicit
approval from an administrator to gain access to these actions [22]. This equips private blockchains with
more functionality for localized use, e.g. database management within a business [23]. Part of the power
of the Ethereum platform is that it allows developers to create private blockchains that still retain the
increased security, privacy, and distributed self-governance that the public platform permits.
Complementary Cloud Decentralization Solutions
There are a few cases of decentralized cloud initiatives entering the market right now, most notably Storj
[31] and Golem [32]. These stand to prove the strength of peer-to-peer networking to delegate utilities.
Both projects are equipped with Ethereum-based smart contracts to commodify the services provided
from one user to another at the lowest possible cost.
Storj
Storj concentrates its efforts on cloud storage. In essence, the service allows users to rent out unused
storage space on their devices and rent such space from others. With this service, users can encrypt and
fragment their files and then distribute them among its network, thus protecting their content from access
by storage providers. Copies of the file fragments can also be distributed among the network to guarantee
the availability of data in case of a failure on one of the hosting servers. By dealing with file fragments
instead of whole files as in centralized cloud storage, the need for trust between users is minimized.
Cloud storage in this manner dissuades targeted attacks on file stores by anonymizing a user’s data and
distributing them across the network. In contrast, attackers will find it relatively simpler to locate the data
centers that specific businesses employ in a centralized cloud service. Of course, whole-network attacks
still prove to be an issue for distributed cloud service providers. Increasing the scale of the network is an
effective defense against most types of attack.
Cloud storage can protect against data loss in ways other than just sending redundant copies of file
fragments across the network. Erasure coding algorithms allow data owners to recover a file even if a few
fragments are corrupted or lost. This way, if a storage provider terminates its node, it becomes much
easier to recover the file from the remaining fragments. Keeping track of the number of remaining file
fragments is necessary to guarantee that erasure coding recovery is successful; to do so across all files
stored can prove difficult for a user who doesn’t have the time or technological knowledge required to
understand this.
11




In Storj, smart contracts decided upon by a user contain all the information describing the relationship
between a data owner and the storage provider. Once accepted by a potential partner, both parties need
only sign the contract to access the service immediately. This contract method drives the cost of renting
storage  space  by  putting users in a competitive marketplace. Users can alternatively utilize services
provided  by  Storj  themselves.  Their  own  storage  service  is  offered  at  a  discount  from  the  major
centralized services, ranging between 35% and 50% of the cost of hyperscale providers [31]. Services are
paid in Storj’s token cryptocurrency, so costs for the service in their currency fluctuate based on the value
of the token. This protects users from volatility of their costs or profits in the market.
Data owners can specify their bandwidth demands in the smart contract, which keeps the Storj algorithms
aware of whole-network demands and allows bandwidth to be evenly distributed. Slow download speeds
are less likely in such a network, especially with the addition of redundant file distribution and erasure
coding.
For users who would struggle with the administration that comes along with the service, Storj provides
the  option  to  use  a  dedicated  ‘Bridge’  server  to  undertake  negotiation,  issuing, and verification of
contracts; payments for services; and recording the state of the file fragments across the network. Of
course these servers reintroduce the issue of placing trust in a third party to guarantee file protection. The
Bridge servers allow developers to utilize the Storj network to host and run their applications. They also
allow public file sharing by hosting encryption keys for public files.
A  disadvantage  of  this  distributed service is the lengths that users must go to in order to maintain
availability of data on the network. By eliminating the need for trust in a central authority with Bridge
servers, users still must manage the file states and preprocess data themselves. For businesses that need to
store a lot of data this means time, knowledge, and money.
Golem
Golem allows users to rent out CPU on their devices or pay to use others’ hardware for computationally
exhaustive tasks. The project’s ultimate goal is to become the world’s first decentralized supercomputer.
As in any cloud service, the distributed network offers parallel processing that allows time-consuming
tasks to be completed quickly when users need it. This means that in the lull periods that Golem’s service
affords its users, users can rent out their own idle CPU to the network and recoup a great deal of the
service’s cost.
Golem also allows software developers to place their own applications on its application registry. This
gives  developers  direct  payment  for  their  services  on  a use-by-use basis. An issue with their open
application registry is that malicious software can be uploaded and utilized by the network. The registry
offers a whitelist and blacklist feature to give users the option to run only validated applications and be
aware of the malicious ones.
12




As with Storj, Golem users can set up their own contracts on the blockchain to form an agreement on the
terms of the service. Users can therefore negotiate their own payment schemes for CPU or application
rental in the smart contracts that accommodate fluctuations in Golem’s currency. Payment for the service
is automatically executed by the contracts on the blockchain that users have agreed to use.
With a distributed network, large-scale outages such as centralized cloud service users have experienced
in the past are no longer an issue. If one server goes down in the middle of task completion, resources can
be pooled from elsewhere in the network to accommodate for it. In the event of a server failure, the
contract between requestor and provider will not be validated and payment transfer will not be initiated.
This acts as insurance against providers who don’t deliver the service they agreed to. Both of these factors
highlight that a business’s downtime is limited by the blockchain and the costs of any downtime are
automatically minimized.

Cloudwith.me Solutions - Abstract
It can take months for businesses to implement cloud services as they stand. Breaking the cloud package
into independent networks, each with their own interface and currency, means businesses will have to
dedicate even more resources to get trained staff to maintain their cloud servers than they would for
centralized cloud hosting.
Cloudwith.me  (“CWM”)  already  offers  its  clients  a  managed  hosting  solution for hyperscale cloud
services. This allows business owners to adapt to their server needs without being weighed down by the
technology and time that goes into setting up and maintaining their cloud server instances. By bringing
the cloud down to Earth, services can be made accessible to businesses big or small, tech-savvy or not.
Managed hosting eliminates much of the need for in-house IT staff and administration in a business, and
lets these departments focus on mission-critical tasks.
Advancing cloud service instances with peer-to-peer decentralization has already proven popular, as can
be seen from the remarkable outcome of the Storj and Golem solutions  [33]  [34]. The cost of such
decentralized  services  is  irrefutably  lower  than  similar  services  from  centralized  providers.  Now
Cloudwith.me steps in to provide a fully functional, complete cloud service that equips its clients with all
the benefits of hyperscale vendors’ packages at a discount. By introducing peer-to-peer cloud services on
their managed platform, clients can focus on understanding the benefits of decentralization instead of its
inner workings.
Even though the security and privacy benefits inherent to blockchain eliminate a lot of the trust and
pricing concerns businesses express for centralized cloud service providers, decentralization can’t provide
a  strong  service  without  a  wide or active network. Indeed, for peer-to-peer networks it’s a case of
‘strength in numbers’. Cloudwith.me has already established a secure client base in managed hosting for
cloud services. This makes Cloudwith.me the ideal platform to transition to a decentralized cloud service,
as both of the major public cloud services can still be used where various aspects of the Cloudwith.me
platform are unavailable or in development. Decentralized services that are ready for market can then be
provided at a discounted price. As the platforms offers both options, clients can see the difference in price
and performance between peer-to-peer and centralized systems directly.
The  Cloudwith.me solution is to endow clients with their own private blockchain application in the
distributed network. Given a private blockchain, the cloud package owner can choose to add devices and
users to the network as they please, making it possible to have a blockchain acting within the business or
between  affiliates.  Smart contracts on the blockchain can be personally tailored to the needs of the
14




business, by the business. Private networks can be employed to automatically manage databases, enable
peer-to-peer file sharing within a business or even to adopt a cloud computing application to utilize the
idle CPU across all of a business’s devices.
From the start, Cloudwith.me platform will enable users to benefit from the largest cloud service provider
services at 50% of the cost. This automatically keeps a running receipt of the services used on the cloud.
The  Cloud  token  grants  Cloudwith.me  clients  the  security  of  Ethereum  payments  and  minimizes
transaction fees for cloud service applications. In this way, clients are incentivised to join Cloudwith.me’s
decentralized cloud. Adoption of the Cloud token increases the scale and therefore the strength of the
cloud network.
Cloudwith.me ultimately aims to create a global marketplace where blockchain-based cloud applications
can be presented and traded with Ether-based payments. The introduction of the Cloud token as the sole
currency for cloud services allows all applications to be experienced in the same ecosystem. Customers of
Cloudwith.me can offer their services and receive payment in Cloud, which they can then use to request
the services they need.

Cloudwith.me Solutions - In-depth Technical Overview
A Decentralized Cloud Hosting Environment
The Blocks of Cloud Computing Services
A  distributed  cloud-hosting  grid  must  address  the  same  needs  as  those  are  answered  by  today’s
centralized cloud hosting platform solutions. To facilitate a meaningful discussion of this topic, let’s
consider the following breakdown of a cloud service environment:
●   The  physical  infrastructure  consists  of  everything that has to do with the hardware and the
physical space in which the hardware is located.  Today, cloud providers operate Data Centers in
which they run thousands of servers, routers and switches, power them with enough electricity,
connect them to the Internet backbone, take care of cooling requirements, and secure access to
them with tons of concrete, barbed wire, steel doors, alarm systems and armed guards.
16




●   The back-office includes software services and user interfaces that allow customers of the cloud
hosting provider  (i.e., cloud application owners) to create accounts, get permission to access
services, receive bills, pay for cloud services usage and receive support.
●   The cloud application runtime environment consists of all of the software components that enable
and  support  the  runtime  of  cloud  applications. The elements in this block provide the core
functionality that differentiates today’s modern cloud platforms from legacy hosting providers.
The following table further details the above by breaking each of the service blocks into layers:
17




Centralized vs. Decentralized Cloud Platforms
The following figure illustrates how centralized cloud platforms operate over a number of data centers
(ranging from a handful of data centers in the case of small providers, up to several dozen in the case of
large providers)—where those data centers are roughly exposed to blocks 2 and 3 using the concept of
Zone or similar (e.g., “AWS US-West”).
Key things to note here: every single component illustrated in this diagram is owned and operated by the
same entity—i.e., the cloud service provider.  When an application owner deploys an application to a
centralized cloud platform, that application owner must do several things:
1.   Establish a legal relationship with the cloud provider (i.e., open an account, provide payment
information, etc.)
2.   Develop  expertise  in  the  cloud  provider’s  proprietary  implementation  of  block                  #3  (cloud
application runtime environment)
3.   Architect and code the application to make optimal use of the cloud provider’s geographical
deployment and service orchestration mechanisms.
A decentralized cloud platform would transform the relationship between the application owner and the
cloud service providers. To understand how, let’s examine the structure of a decentralized cloud platform
as illustrated below:
18




There are several key differences from the previous topology:
1.   The basic building block of the decentralized cloud platform is a GridNode component, providing
the basic cloud platform service blocks.
2.   The GridNodes are interconnected to form a mesh network for service management and request
routing. Each GridNode is connected to the blockchain..
3.   GridNodes are operated by a variety of different service providers
4.   The GridNodes expose a uniform application runtime environment, thereby allowing seamless
migration of application code between service providers.
5.   The application owner creates a blockchain-based accounting relationship with the decentralized
platform, not with the providers.
GridNodes  are intended to be installed and operated by GridNode owners, who can be independent
operators as well as cloud service providers. This flexibility allows the grid to evolve from the current
state and expand to a global scale. This is, of course, a long-term vision that is extremely flexible and
supports a wide variety of use cases.  But as explained in later sections of this document, the evolution of
GridNodes can start today by supporting a limited set of scenarios and gradually evolving to fulfill the
open grid vision.

Benefits of Decentralization
Cost Reduction
One of the realities of our economy is that new technologies eventually become commoditized, and the
market moves from differentiated to undifferentiated price competition, and from monopolistic to perfect
competition [link]. To quote Columbia Business School professor Bruce Greenwald: “In the long run,
everything is a toaster” [link]. But until new technologies and services become commoditized, their prices
are kept well above what they become when the market opens up to price-based competition.
The cloud-hosting space is currently very far from perfect competition. It has been described by some as
an oligopoly  [link]: a market dominated by a handful of major players, where no new player of any
meaningful size can enter.
An oligopoly has a natural tendency to drive prices way above what they might be in a truly competitive
market.
The Company believes that the decentralization process will drive commoditization of cloud services to
commodity rates as low as 94% below current market prices. Essentially, the goal is to have cloud
services on equal status to running water or electricity in developed countries—a utility, removed from
price gaps or unnecessary markups.
20




As demonstrated most recently by Uber and Lyft in the ridesharing domain, enabling almost anyone to
become a service provider can transform that market and bring prices down [link].
Privacy and Security
The distribution of application data and logic across millions of nodes, each one secured independently
and located in a different place, makes it difficult for an attacker to obtain access to a hoard of sensitive
information items.
Similarly, with the right protections and isolations in place, the GridNode owner is unaware of the data
and computations performed in the GridNode.
Akin  to  “double  blind”  clinical  trial  protocols,  data  is  secured  from  both  malicious  end-users  and
GridNode owners.
Increased Resiliency
Another important benefit of decentralizing the cloud is improved resiliency. Today, the vast majority of
cloud services are being provisioned from no more than a few hundred data centers, located in strategic
locations around the world. As a result, failure in a single data center can have catastrophic effects on a
significant number of Internet users that rely on applications that run in those data centers.  As recently as
21




last March, AWS Storage services in Amazon’s US-East-1 region in northern Virginia had an outage,
affecting, as reported in The Register  [link]:  “Docker's Registry Hub, Trello, Travis CI, GitHub and
GitLab, Quora, Medium, Signal, Slack, Imgur, Twitch.tv, Razer, heaps of publications that stored images
and other media in S3, Adobe's cloud, Zendesk, Heroku, Coursera, Bitbucket, Autodesk's cloud, Twilio,
Mailchimp, Citrix, Expedia, Flipboard” and more.
A decentralization of cloud hosting would exponentially increase the number of locations that serve cloud
applications, turning the effect of a failure in any one of those locations into a much less painful event.
Operational Transparency
The knowledge we have today, as a society, about the overall use of computational resources across the
globe is filled with uncertainty: neither application owners nor cloud service providers are under any
obligation whatsoever to release accurate and complete information about how many servers are being
used, where they are located geographically, what type of cloud services are being consumed and so forth.
The decentralized grid can include mechanisms that contribute valuable knowledge about usage statistics
without  revealing  sensitive  business  details,  and  allow  all  of  us  to  better  research  and  understand
computational usage patterns and trends across the globe.
Better Network Performance
One  of  the  exciting  benefits  of  the  decentralized  grid  is  that  it  could  eventually  provide  better
performance for users that are not located near high-bandwidth trunks, such as underdeveloped regions or
countries. If an application is used extensively in a certain geographic area of the globe, and the grid is
architected to facilitate such behavior through appropriate transparency and bidding mechanisms, then the
application would tend to migrate to that region, thereby reducing distances between server and end-user,
improving performance and reducing traffic costs.
More Choice
Today the large cloud providers offer a large menu of platform and application services, yet it is a limited
set, fully controlled by the provider. Subscribers of cloud services benefit from services such as managed
databases, but they are locked in, with little incentive to migrate to a different provider, or to use multiple
providers. The open GridNode platform will be built to accommodate third parties of building blocks
from  any  layer.  Choices  are  expected  to  significantly  outnumber  existing  offerings  by  a  single
cloud-service provider.
In addition, decentralized cloud operating on blockchain currency payment method lowers the barrier to
entry and creates accessibility of pro cloud services to developing countries where credit cards, which are
the standard modus operandi for the current cloud services, are scarce. The Cloud token becomes an
equalizer and helps to bring services to every country on equal grounds.
22




Grid Growth Expectations
As the project is put into motion, the community should be able to track progress and understand whether
the entire grid, as a decentralized hosting entity, is making a significant impact and indeed transforming
the way cloud services are consumed globally.
One  of  the  things  we  would  like  to  do  is  compare  the  total  computing power  (in FLOPS) of the
decentralized  grid  with  the  total  computing  power  offered  by  the  major  cloud  service  providers.
Unfortunately, there is no reliable data about how much computing power is made available by the major
cloud providers.  However, some data exists on the total electrical power consumed by those providers,
and we can also make some educated guesses about the performance per watt of the machines hosted by
them and the critical power loads in their data centers.
We suggest that those metrics—of total power consumption and total computing power—could also be
useful  for  understanding  the  growth  of  the  grid as a computational entity. Those metrics also help
understand efficiencies and thereby the environmental impact. As an open community, we would like to
see the grid not only create more transparency, resiliency and cost reduction, but also have a positive
environmental effect.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Let  us  examine  the  total  set  servers                                         Sθ   operated  by  a  cloud  hosting  provider  θ be  defined  as

Looking at various sources (e.g., [link] and [link]) we can probably assume that for today’s servers the
value of  ω would be in the range of around 2-4 GFLOPS/Watt. We should also assume that data centers
have a mix of newer and older servers, where the older servers have a lower energy efficiency.
To examine the power consumption (and from that infer the computational power) of  Θ we must take into
consideration, not just the power consumed by the servers themselves (critical power), but also the power
consumed by ancillary systems in the data center—most notably cooling (but also lighting systems and
others). Since not all data centers have the same power efficiency, let                                     be the weighted average power   eΘ
consumption overhead of all data centers in which the servers are stored.

FLOPS).
These numbers and formulas give us a sense of desired scale and a way to monitor the growth of the
decentralized grid, while also providing some baseline energy efficiency targets.
In an effort to calculate the cost of bootstrapping a decentralized grid that is comparable to just 4% of the
effective computing power of an AWS data center (as an example), while the actual computations are
beyond the scope of this paper, we calculate an estimate that will guide the level of funds needed to
achieve critical mass on the path to decentralization.
For that matter, we assume an average cost of $30K/server.  This cost also factors in estimated operational
costs for three years as well as the cost of the networking equipment, etc. (i.e. the effective computing
power we get at this cost should not be assumed to be high). We then assume each such compute unit,
which for simplicity purposes runs a single GridNode and has an effective computing power of 100
gigaflops on average which means that to get an effective computing power of 25.6 petaflops in total we
would need 10,240 GridNodes.
With one GridNode per server, and at a server price of $30K, the total cost for the GridNodes critical
mass bootstrap would be approximately $307M.  That might seem like a high number, but it’s just 1% of
the $31.5B spent on capital expenses and leases by the top three cloud service providers in 2016 alone, or
of Google’s $30B overall cloud spending.
Application Use Case Analysis
Let’s examine the common use case of a web/mobile application back-end, and compare the behavior of
the centralized vs. decentralized approaches. In this sort of scenario, we have the following entities:
●   End-users: interacting with the hosted application via a personal front-end application
●   The  application  owner:  requiring  physical  and  logical infrastructure to host and operate the
application
●   The  cloud  services  provider:  furnishing  the  application  owner  with  the  means  to  run  the
application.
25




Centralized Cloud
The following drawing describes the trivial case of a single user accessing the cloud-hosted app:
The end-user operates the personal computing device (mobile phone, laptop, gaming console or other).
The front-end application (e.g., a browser or a mobile app) runs on the user’s device, and interacts with a
single instance of the cloud-application logic to achieve tasks such as getting the contents of web pages,
storing  progress  in  a  game,  sending  an  email  message,  initiating  an  online  purchase, or any other
applicative operation.
Referring to our service blocks layers (in the above table), let’s describe a common configuration using
the  layers  terminology.  In  this  configuration,  our  cloud  application  logic                             (layer   3.5)  is  written  in
TypeScript using bootstrap.js (layer 3.4) and transpiled into javascript code running on node.js (layer 3.3)
to implement the REST APIs and the back-end algorithms required for the applicative system to function
correctly. The code leverages mongodb  (layer  3.3) and an object store provided by the cloud service
provider (layer 3.2), and it runs on a virtual machine (layer 3.1) that executes on a physical server (layer
1.3) in a secure data center  (layers  1.2,  1.1) operated by the cloud service provider.   In addition to
26




consuming services provided by the cloud service provider, it also leverages a set of services that it
receives from external sources (e.g., a payment processing service).
The application owner pays the hosting provider to have this entire stack execute on the provider’s
infrastructure. It is the responsibility of the hosting provider to ensure that the infrastructure operates
seamlessly  and  supports  the  needs  of  the  applications.  As  this  application  consumes services from
external providers, it is up to the application owner to establish a relationship and settle payments with
those other providers.
To support the high load generated by a multitude of users, applications need to scale. This requires that
more  than  one  compute  engines  be available to execute multiple instances of the application logic.
Requests from different external users are routed to different instances of the application, based on factors
such as resource availability, application context, geographic location, and so forth.
To  support  such  scaling,  the  cloud-hosting  provider  also  allows  the application owner to rent load
balancing and content delivery services in order to route front-end requests to available instances of the
application that are in the general geographic area of the request origin.
27




In addition to deploying the application logic to multiple compute engines, the cloud services consumed
by the application logic must also scale to support the high load generated by having multiple application
instances access them:
The  implementation  and  operation  of  a  highly  scalable  cloud-hosting  infrastructure  requires  a
considerable amount of resources (data centers, computers, networking equipment, electricity, cooling,
physical  security,  etc.).  Only  a  small  number  of  very  large  companies  are  able  to  provide  such
infrastructure on a global scale.
Decentralized Cloud
Returning to the trivial case of a single user accessing the web/mobile backend cloud-hosted app, let’s
examine how this would work in the decentralized topology, where a GridNode executes a single instance
of a cloud application via a sandboxed environment such as a virtual machine or container  (i.e., an
element in layer 3.1).
28




As before, we have three primary participating entities (end-user, application-owner and cloud services
provider), only now there is no direct relationship between the application-owner and the cloud services
provider (i.e., the GridNode owner), as the relationship is established using a smart contract between the
application owner and the grid.
The GridNode owner is responsible for setting up the GridNode, connecting it to the decentralized grid
via the Internet and ensuring its ongoing operation.
A blockchain (initially Ethereum-based Cloud token, but other blockchains will also be supported) is used
to send payments to the GridNode owner and other participating parties—but also for additional purposes,
such as entity description, performance metrics, etc.
The fundamental interaction between the front-end software and a single application instance that is
hosted on a GridNode is quite similar to that of traditional cloud hosting, with one important exception:
routing of the request from the front-end device to the GridNode is achieved through a grid-based load
balancing system, rather than through a load balancer operated by a single cloud services provider.  The
load-balancing logic is embedded into the GridNode, so that every GridNode can optionally participate in
the routing of network requests.
The GridNode provides the application with a full runtime environment (block 3).  Many aspects of the
application’s  architecture  would  be similar to the previous case, but some aspects might differ. For
example, while the app’s layer 3.4 elements might still be TypeScript and bootstrap.js, and the layer 3.3
app server is still node.js, the underlying storage service (layer 3.2) might be based on Storj or a similar
decentralized storage system. Conversely, an application running on a GridNode might choose to leverage
29




Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, while running some of its compute functionality on a decentralized
supercomputer such as Golem. To put this in more general terms, layer 3.2 and 3.3 (see table p.15)
services such as storage, analytics, message queuing, etc. are provided to the Application Logic using
three different means:
●   Some services are provided directly by software components on the GridNode.
●   Other  services  are  provided  by  entities  that  are  external  to  the  GridNode,  but  through  a
standardized API that is provided by the GridNode to the application through a ‘Cloud Services
Gateway’ component.  Those external services can run on other GridNodes, or be hosted other
environments such as classic cloud hosting. The Cloud Services Gateway component enables the
grid to provide a blockchain-based token conversion mechanism for those external services.
●   Application Owners can also pay external providers for consumption of additional cloud services
by the application, just like they can in the traditional cloud hosting approach. Such payments
would not necessarily be via blockchain-based currency.
The big difference between the traditional cloud hosting approach and the open grid becomes apparent
when we examine how the grid supports scaling of applications. In the traditional approach, we see
multiple instances of the cloud application logic being executed by multiple compute engines that are
operated by the same cloud services provider.  In the decentralized cloud, we still see multiple instances
of  the  application  logic—only  now they are served by compute engines that are operated by many
different GridNode owners.
30




Cloud-Hosting Contracts
When  designing  the  smart  contracts  for  the  decentralized  service,  we must consider the needs and
expectations  of  both  the  GridNode  owners  and  the  application  owners.  As  the  objective  of  the
Cloudwith.me Open Grid is to provide a service that is comparable to traditional cloud hosting, let’s first
examine how contracts between application owners and cloud service providers are built today, and see
how that would be translated to the decentralized cloud.
How Things Are Done Today
Most cloud-hosting contracts include at least the following elements:
●   The cloud-hosting provider commits to provide the application owner with a certain predefined
package of services in return for payments that are calculated to take into account a number of
factors. Factors may include such things as the amount and type of allocated resources, expected
availability of the resources, expected response time in case of faults, and so forth.
●   The application owner commits to pay for the services, and use them only according to certain
terms set by the hosting provider. Almost always, the hosting provider would require that the
application  owner  will  only  use  the  service  for  lawful  purposes  (including  such  things  as
avoidance of copyright infringement, using only software that the application owner is allowed to
use, not supporting any illegal or immoral activities, and so forth), and that the application owner
will not abuse any APIs provided by the hosting provider or disrupt the services of the hosting
provider in any way.
Hosting providers almost always commit to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) that defines what level of
performance the customer can expect from the hosted environment, and what would be the compensation
in case the hosting provider is unable to live up to that promise (many cloud-hosting providers give
‘service credits’-i.e., they provide a limited discount on future services—to make up for downtime or
slow performance suffered by the customer).
The  type  of  service  in  question                                                                          (e.g.,  compute,  network,  data  backup,  etc.)  determines  which
measurements are possible on that service. The specific definition of metrics and service levels varies
across cloud service providers, but they usually refer to uptime (often measured as a monthly percentage),
and in some cases the response time as well.
31




Smart Contracts
Supporting the Relationship Between GridNode Owner and Application Owner
The relationship between a GridNode owner and an application owner is very similar—in terms of mutual
commitment and expectations—to the relationship between an application owner and a cloud services
provider:
●   The GridNode owner would commit to provide the application owner with a predefined package
of services and capabilities, and expect to receive appropriate payments in return for providing
those services as promised.
●   The application owner would commit to pay for the services, and to use those services  in a way
that does not disrupt the operation of the GridNode or for any unlawful or immoral purposes.
However,  a  key  conceptual  problem  that  an  open  grid  service  needs to deal with is trust between
GridNode owners and application owners. Unlike classic cloud hosting, the application owner is not
interacting with a well-known brand, and cannot simply rely on the name of the GridNode owner to
decide whether to trust that entity to live up to those commitments. Similarly, the GridNode owner might
not have the required financial resources to deal with application owners who do not live up to their
commitments.
The Trust Issue
GridNode  owners  do  not  inherently  trust  the  application  owners,  but  they  want  to  be  sure  those
application owners will pay them for the resources they consume and will not misuse the service.
On the other hand, application owners do not inherently trust the GridNode owners, but want to be sure
that if they pay (or commit to pay) for grid resources, then they will actually get those resources from the
GridNode owners.
In many cases, Blockchain smart contracts aim to remove the need for trust by completely automating the
conclusion  of  a  contract  through  objectively verifiable means. Unfortunately, in the Cloud Services
domain, the reliable and accurate provisioning of computational services cannot be 100% verified by
automated means [link].
32




This situation creates an evident conundrum:
1.   If the Application owners commit to pay before getting access to the resources: as there is no
fully-automated way to verify that the cloud resources behaved as promised, how can application
owners know that the GridNode owners won’t just take the payment and then not provide the
promised resources?
2.   If the GridNode owners commit to provide the resources before getting paid: as there is no
fully-automated  way  to  prove  that  they  actually  provided  the  correct  resources,  how  can
GridNode owners know that the application owners won’t use the resources and then refuse to
approve payment (even if placed in escrow), claiming that the resources provided were not as
promised?
A Blockchain-Based Reputation Mechanism
The established mechanism for overcoming this problem—of enabling a trust-based transaction between
anonymous buyers and sellers on the Internet—is a reputation system.   This mechanism is used by
companies like eBay and Amazon to facilitate trust-building for the sale of physical goods.   Companies
like eBay and Amazon serve as a trusted intermediary, managing a central database of the reputation of
both buyers and sellers, and providing a dispute resolution service to overcome disagreements when those
arise.
Cloudwith.me intends to create a blockchain-based reputation system that is based on a smart contract for
subscribing to cloud resources (Cloud tokens).
A primary concept of Cloud tokens is GridReputation. GridReputation is stored  (both for GridNode
owners  and  for  application  owners)  on  the  blockchain                                                  (initially  the  Ethereum  blockchain,  but  a
mechanism will be developed to transfer GridReputation to other blockchains in the future).
GridReputation is a measure of how trustworthy the participant has been so far: application owners gain
GridReputation when they demonstrate that they are well-behaved systems of the grid and quickly pay for
services they have used, and lose GridReputation if they use grid resources and then fail to pay for them,
or otherwise fail to abide by the terms of service.
GridNode owners gain GridReputation by providing reliable hosting services, and lose GridReputation if
the  hosting  services  they  provide  prove  to  be  unreliable                                             (e.g.,  the  environment  crashes,  network
bandwidth is too low, etc.).
Reputation  elements  for  GridNode  Owners:  uptime,  consistent  performance  as  promised  (compute,
network, data r/w access), data storage reliability, trustworthiness  (i.e., they only charge for services
rendered), data security.
33




There are two modes whereby the grid grants access to GridNode resources:
●   Option 1:   pay now, use later (like buying a prepaid SIM or an Amazon gift card)
●   Option 2:   use now, pay later (like giving your credit card number to a hosting provider)
Pay-now-use-later will be favored when the application owner does not yet have a strong reputation.
Use-now-pay-later will be favored in situations where a GridNode owner does not yet have a strong
reputation.
Performance-monitoring Agents
Performance-monitoring agents can be introduced into the grid for the purpose of allowing GridNode
owners to have a third party periodically assess their level of service, publicize the results, and objectively
influence their GridReputation over a range of service metric dimensions.
A trivial example of a performance-monitoring agent could be an “uptime tracker”, paid to periodically
check the uptime of nodes in the grid.
Other  performance  monitors  could  assess  aspects  such  as  compute  engine  performance,  bandwidth
reliability, firewall setup, hardware configuration reliability, and so forth. Such performance monitors
would send compute jobs to selected GridNodes and assess the performance of those nodes by running
benchmark  jobs  and  comparing  the  actual  result  to  what  is  expected, given the platform attributes
published by the GridNode owner.
Entities that run such performance monitoring tasks have could be incentivized through smart contracts to
maintain  their  objectivity,  either  by  acting  as  Oracles                                                    (where multiple independent monitors would
perform independent assessments on the same GridNode, and a monitor who deviates significantly from
the majority finding would risk losing a deposit), or by creating a mechanism whereby the payment for
publishing the results of the investigations would come from the GridNode owner if the results were
positive, and from the application owner if the results were negative.
Dispute Resolution
As with any reputation-based mechanism, disputes are bound to arise. To facilitate dispute resolution, the
infrastructure and smart contract for the decentralized grid will take into account the need to transfer
payments to arbitrators (possibly as Oracles on the blockchain), and to expose to them operational logs
that can help them make decisions.
34




Ensuring Integrity of Code and Data
A naive design of a hosting grid would be vulnerable to malicious parties who join the grid as GridNode
owners—with the intent to steal or modify sensitive data that is processed by cloud applications.
Traditional  cloud  providers  do  not  have  an incentive to steal customer data: as organizations, their
reputation depends on their ability to increase confidence that applications are not tampered with, and
they are also potentially liable to legal action should they cause the leak of sensitive information that they
are supposed to protect. However, some employees (or partners) of those organizations might potentially
abuse the access they have to data.  As such, providers advertise the use of physical security mechanisms
to prevent access to the machines, and they fire employees who are found to tamper with data. While this
approach is essentially trust-based and is not entirely foolproof, it does make it difficult for attackers to
reach the data,.
As anyone can join the grid as GridNode owner, the grid cannot assume that all GridNode operators are
trustworthy custodians of data.
A  malicious  GridNode  owner  might  attack the grid using various means. Two prominent examples
include:
●   Operating  a  modified  GridNode that steals information from the applications it executes, or
modifies data in some way that benefits the malicious party.
●   Installing  a  shadow                                                                                        (RAID)  drive  on  the  machine  that  runs  the  GridNode,  and  physically
removing it from the machine in order to copy sensitive information from it.
As an application owner, you cannot by any means deploy the SSL certificate with your TLS secret key to
a web server hosted on an unknown machine that you cannot reasonably trust.
While there are means that a Cloud application might employ to obtain some level of confidence that it is
not running on a modified GridNode, no software mechanism can self-verify with 100% certainty that it is
running on an uncompromised operating system. Even worse, there is no means whatsoever by which a
software application could detect the existence of a shadow hard drive that is installed on the computer.
The conclusion from the above is that there is a need for external means to increase confidence in the
trustworthiness of the computing environment operated by the GridNode owner.
There are essentially three approaches that the grid could combine to provide such means:
1.   Cryptographically assure the real-world identity of any GridNode operator. Application owners
will be able to whitelist or blacklist specific operators based on their identity.
2.   Perform spot inspections of the GridNode operator’s physical infrastructure
35




a.   GridNode owners who wish to increase their ‘data safety’ reputation will sign up for
surprise inspections by independent inspectors.  The smart contract for data safety will
assure that such owners will escrow a fraction of their Cloud tokens revenue to pay the
inspectors who inspect their site.
b.   To  reduce  the  likelihood  of  the  independent  inspectors  colluding  with  malicious
GridNode owners, some GridNode owners will be rewarded for running honeypot sting
operations to uncover unreliable inspectors. This reward will come from an escrow of a
portion of the fees paid to the inspectors—also assured by the smart contract.
3.   Support  Trusted  Execution  Technology  with  cryptographic  signatures  for  attestation  of  the
authenticity of the GridNode application and the underlying Operating System, as well as the
physical architecture of the computer.   We envision that as the number of GridNode owners
increases, the availability of such platforms will increase, and we intend to work directly with
partners who wish to create ‘trusted data-center-in-a-box’ appliances.
GridNode operators that wish to maintain a very high data-safety reputation level would combine at least
two if not all three of the above.
Compliance Considerations
Regulatory Compliance
Another  important  aspect of the decentralized grid is regulatory compliance. There are two primary
dimensions to take into consideration: geographic regulations, and domain-specific regulations.
Two  prominent  examples  of  geographical  regulation  include  the  upcoming  European  General  Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the recently imposed Chinese regulations on cloud service providers.
GridNode owners who fall under the jurisdiction of such regulation must comply with it or risk being
subjected  to  very  high  fines.                                                                               (Note  that  the  EU  GDPR  applies to any entity that handles personal
information—including  IP  addresses—of  European  citizens,  regardless  of  where  the  servers  are
physically located [link]). This means that the GridNode component must include mechanisms for data
security and privacy to assure such compliance.
Domain-specific  regulations—for  example  HIPAA                                                                (for  health                                                              [link])  or  PCI-DSS  (for  credit  card
information [link])—impose even higher security requirements both on the application owner and on the
operator of the infrastructure running the application. Regardless of whether the regulation comes from
governments  or  from  industry  associations,  applications  that  fall  into  categories  covered  by  such
regulation will not be able to run on an infrastructure (i.e., a GridNode) that doesn’t comply with those
regulations.

Uniform Terms of Service for Application Owners
Since GridNodes are intended to be hosted in a wide variety of locations—including a multitude of
cloud-hosting providers—each such hosting provider requires that application owners using the hosting
provider’s services comply with the hosting provider’s legal terms of service. This means that application
owners who run their applications on multiple GridNodes distributed across several hosting provider
facilities need to abide by the terms of service of each and every one of those hosting providers.
One of the goals of the open grid is to define uniform terms of service that all hosting providers see as
sufficient, so that once application owners agree to those uniform terms of service, they will be free to
have  their  applications  operate  on  GridNodes  that  are  hosted on the facilities of any cloud-hosting
provider.
Deploying Application Instances
Deployment Parameters
To create instances of an application, the application owner needs to deploy an application to the
decentralized grid. There are several important aspects to consider here:
1.   The grid will contain a mix of many variants of GridNodes from many different providers. When
deploying an application instance to the grid, the application owner will specify certain criteria,
and only GridNodes that meet those requirements will be eligible to bid on the right to deploy a
copy  of  this  application.  The  following  is  a  non-exhaustive list that illustrates the types of
parameters that the application owner might choose to specify. Note that some parameters are
optional, and since we are dealing with a highly heterogeneous grid environment, the parameter
values need not be exact and might be a range of acceptable values from the point of view of the
application:
○   Layer 1.1:  geographical location, physical security requirements from the machine (e.g.,
is it required to be hosted in a secure data center, is it expected to employe Trusted
Computing technologies for tamper-proofing, etc.)
○   Layer 1.2:   hosting location bandwidth
○   Layer 1.3:  hardware configuration (cpu speed, memory, max # of VMs per bare metal
machine)
○   Layer  3.1:   type of OS, allocated memory for the VM/Container, network bandwidth
assigned to the VM/Container, amount of local storage available, type of local filesystem
○   Layers 3.2, 3.3: a list of cloud APIs (and API versions) that are expected to be supported
directly by the GridNode, firewall requirements
37




○   Layer 3.4:  platform components installation requirements (Does the application owner
expect certain packages  (e.g., Ruby-on-Rails or WordPress) to be preinstalled on the
machine, or does the owner already include the entire set of platform components in the
application bundle for deployment?)
○   Layer 3.5:  is the application expected to stay on the machine even after the execution
period is over, or can the application be removed from local storage once execution is
completed?
2.                                                                                                             In  addition  to  technical  requirements from the GridNode, the application owner can specify
business criteria, including:
○   A minimal reputation for the GridNode owner
○   Integrity requirements (e.g., frequency of audits)
○   Historical results from performance monitors
○   Regulatory compliance requirements
○   Payment mode (a ratio of use-now-pay-later to pay-now-use-later)
○   Resource allocation duration—i.e., for how long are the computing resources going to be
reserved?
○   Agreed dispute resolution mechanisms
○   Black-listed and/or white-listed GridNode operators
3.                                                                                                             Pricing. When an application instance is deployed to the grid, the application owner specifies the
maximum price to be paid for every type of service that the application consumes.  This might be
specified for the entire application, but might also be specified on a per-component basis, in the
case where the application consumes multiple resources.
4.                                                                                                             User experience.  It is important to allow people who are not cloud experts to be able to deploy
applications  to  the  grid.   As  such,  the  user  experience  for  performing  all  of  the  above
specifications should be made clear and intuitive.
5.                                                                                                             Decentralization assurance.  In order to ensure that the grid does not become controlled by a small
number of large GridNode owners, the grid will incorporate mechanisms to incentivize (or even
require)  that when a large number of instances of an application are deployed, they will be
distributed between multiple GridNode owners.
Cloudwith.me’s Existing Interface for Traditional Cloud Providers
Today’s  cloud  hosting  providers  offer  a  very  wide  range  of  execution  environment  types  and
configurations, and the selection of the right configuration is a highly technical task that requires unique
knowledge and expertise.
Cloudwith.me’s existing product already simplifies this task by providing a friendly user interface that
makes it a breeze to set up compute environments on AWS, Azure and Google to support common
application use cases.
38




The two screenshots below are taken from Cloudwith.me’s existing interface, and demonstrate how easy
it is use our existing product to provision such environments in the classic cloud.  Our intention is to bring
the same level of simplicity and friendliness to the process of deploying applications to the decentralized
grid.

46




Market Opportunity
IDC and Gartner have forecast that the global public cloud service industry will reach over $195 billion in
revenues by  2020, doubling figures from last year  [4]  [35]. Within this industry, the cloud-managed
service  market  is  expected  to  grow  at  an expected CAGR of  14.6%  [36]. As more businesses and
individuals take the leap into the cloud, the providers they’re drawn to will be decided by: cost, range of
services, availability, ease of integration with their existing computer framework, transparency of the
service, and risk mitigation. The combination of blockchain technology with an automated managed
solution addresses all of these concerns.
Fig: Plotted using data from [36]
Adoption of public cloud services by SMBs has been rising rapidly over the past years. This is reflected in
Cloudwith.me’s success with its current managed hosting platform. A 2014 study by IDC found that 65%
of SMBs worldwide made use of cloud storage [37]. Their 2016 report on cloud adoption summarizes that
by then, over  70% of small businesses and over 90% of medium-sized businesses had adopted cloud
services [38]. Despite this, nearly 50% of SMBs still experience cyber attacks [9].
47




Cloud Token ICO
The Ethereum-based Cloud token ICO is intended to create the first block in the vision of Decentralized
Applications Internet by providing a standard currency to be used by all cloud services and service
providers.
From the start, the Cloudwith.me platform will enable users to benefit from the largest cloud service
provider services at  50% cost reduction. Already making a difference, the Company is determined to
change the way people use and consume cloud services.
The Cloud token will evolve during its lifetime into several instances where a new version of cloud with
smarter contracts and more efficient cloud services payments governance will match the growth and
expansion of the GridNodes both in volume and sophistication.
Generation I, Cloud will enable trusted payments for cloud servers, storage, bandwidth and processing
power.
Generation II, Cloud aims to become the token governing exchange of decentralized peer-to-peer cloud
services
A  Cloud  token  holder  has  the  inherent  right  to  replace  (by choice) each existing coin of previous
generation into a new one at no cost.
Periodically, new Clouds will be announced and offered to existing holders who can choose to send their
old tokens back to the company in exchange for the new ones.
All legacy generation tokens will be destroyed and annulled once replaced. All generation tokens will
retain their attributes of independence from the Company itself and will bear no rights in relation to the
Company itself or its activities.
48




Use of Proceeds
The use of proceeds will be predominately for the global deployment of the GridNode infrastructure as
per the model shown in the above “Grid Growth Expectations” section.
The company believes that this amount is sufficient in order to bootstrap the decentralized cloud nodes
infrastructure growth.
Self-deployment of GridNodes is planned globally from the first successful run of the CWM blockchain
GridNode module. In this quantity, the Company believes a critical mass of nodes can be reached within
circa 12-18 months from which point the growth of the decentralized web will become viral-positive and
the adoption of the GridNodes by new peer-to-peer Providers will accelerate at a reasonable rate for
gaining momentum, leading into complete Cloud migration to blockchain within circa five years from the
initial Ringo seeding stage.
In an effort to calculate the cost of bootstrapping a decentralized grid that is comparable to just 4% of the
effective  computing  power an AWS data center  (as an example), while the actual computations are
beyond the scope of this paper, we calculate an estimate that will guide the level of funds needed to
achieve critical mass on the path to decentralization.
For that matter, we assume an average cost of $30K/server.  This cost also factors in estimated operational
costs for three years as well as the cost of the networking equipment, etc. (i.e., the effective computing
power we get at this cost should not be assumed to be high).  We then assume each such compute unit,
which for simplicity purposes runs a single GridNode and has an effective computing power of 100
gigaflops on average, which means that to get an effective computing power of 25.6 petaflops in total we
would need 10,240 GridNodes. With one GridNode per server, and at a server price of $30K, the total
cost for the GridNodes critical mass bootstrap would be approximately $307M.  That might seem like a
high number, but it’s just 1% of the $31.5B spent on capital expenses and leases by the top three cloud
service providers in 2016 alone, or of Google’s $30B overall cloud spending.
In addition to the main use of funds, the Company will be financing the active promotion of GridNodes
contributions via a “Become a Provider” campaign and ongoing development of its GridNodes and DAP
technologies.
The overall amount raised has acceptance flexibility as lower amounts simply dictate longer adoption
cycles and slower deployment rates, leading to longer lead times to full migration of cloud services to
blockchain decentralization.
49




Risk Factors
The following are the risk factors in relation to Cloudwith.me (“CWM”) business in general and the token
sale event in particular:
CWM Token may not ever become a crypto currency
There is no assurance that at any time in the future the CWM Token (i) may be exchanged for
goods or services,  (ii) may have any known uses outside the CWM platform, or (iii) may be
traded on any known exchanges.
Risk of failure to reach target sale amounts or risk of insufficient funds
CWM may not reach the target sale amount and may not have the sufficient funds to execute its
business plan.
Risk of market trends
The CWM token may be significantly influenced by digital currency market trends and Cloud
value  may  be  severely  depreciated  due  to  non-Cloud-related  events  in  the  digital  currency
markets.
Risk of regulation/legislation
The Cloud services market and/or the token market may be or may be coming under global or
local regulation/legislation that may render the Cloud trade impossible and/or may limit the use of
tokens as a payment method and/or limit, prevent and/or sanction the sale and re-sale of tokens.
COI and relevant technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies
around  the  world.  The functioning of CWM and Token could be impacted by one or more
regulatory inquiries or actions, including but not limited to restrictions on the use or possession of
digital tokens like Token, which could impede or limit the development of CWM.
50




Risk of software not meeting expectations
The GridNodes and DAP are presently under development and may undergo significant changes
before release. Any expectations regarding the form and functionality of Token or the GridNodes
and DAP may not be met upon release, for any number of reasons including a change in the
design and implementation plans and execution of the GridNodes and DAP.
GridNodes  and  DAP  are  complex  software  platforms and their launch may be significantly
delayed due to unforeseen development barriers.
Risk of alternate technology
There is no guarantee that there are no other solutions or technology, whether being developed or
to be developed in the future, that will severely depreciate the value of CWM as well as of its
products and services.
Competition may introduce same or better solutions and cause CWM to lose market share and
eventually fail to deliver on its business goals.
Risk of high volatility
Digital currencies are extremely volatile and Cloud token may suffer from said volatility.
Risk of taxation
The ownership of Cloud tokens may fall under existing and/or new and unpredicted taxation laws
that will erode Cloud benefits.
Risk of low to no liquidity
Cloud may not succeed in creating the necessary momentum and acceptance, which may result in
low liquidity and   depletion of trades.
51




Risk of theft and hacking
Token sales and ICOs have been known to come under malicious attacks from hackers and
criminal parties, resulting in theft of tokens, and massive losses to Token may be inflicted on
buyers and the Company.
Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the CWM activity or the
availability  of  CWM  Token  in any number of ways, including, without limitation denial of
service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks.
Risk of security weaknesses in the CWM network core infrastructure software
There is a risk that the CWM team, or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally
introduce  weaknesses  or  bugs  into  the  core  infrastructural  elements  of  the  CWM  software
network, interfering with the use of or causing the loss of CWM Tokens.
Risk of weaknesses or exploitable breakthroughs in the field of cryptography
Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers,
could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the CWM platform, which could result in the theft or
loss of Tokens.
Token sales and ICOs have been known to come under malicious attacks from hackers and
criminal parties resulting in theft of Tokens and massive losses may be inflicted on buyers and the
Company
High-risk purchase
There is no guarantee that the CWM Token you purchase will increase in value. It may—and
probably will at some point—decrease in value.
The activity of CWM is highly speculative, as CWM is a private and growing company with no
regulatory approvals and there is no assurance such approvals, if they will be required, will be
obtained or that any income shall be generated or any products shall be successfully developed.
52




Risk of insufficient interest in the CWM activity
It  is  possible  that  the  CWM  software  will  not  be  used  by  a  large  number  of  businesses,
individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in its creation
and development. Such lack of interest could impact the development of CWM software and
services and therefore the potential uses or value of Tokens.
Risk of uninsured losses
Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, funds held using the CWM
network are generally uninsured. In the event of loss or loss of value, there is no public insurer or
private insurer to offer recourse to the purchaser.
Risk of dissolution of CWM
It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including without limitation, the failure of
business relationships or the emergence of competing intellectual property claims, CWM may no
longer be a viable business and may dissolve or fail to launch.
Risk of malfunction in the GridNodes and DAP
It is possible that the GridNodes and DAP malfunction in an unfavorable way, including but not
limited to one that results in the loss of data and information.
Unanticipated risks
Cryptocurrency and cryptographic tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the
risks set forth here, there are risks that the CWM team cannot anticipate. Risks may further
materialize in the form of unanticipated combinations or variations of the risks set forth here.
