MZI and MZG will leverage the current industry
standards – Ethereum blockchain – for issuing
custom digital assets and smart contracts.
By conforming to the ERC-20 token interface,
MZI will be compatible with existing Ethereum
infrastructure, such as wallets and exchanges.
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows
the deployment and execution of smart contracts,
enabling complex issuance rules for cryptocurrencies like MZI and MZG. EVM eliminates any
question of trust and protects the transacting
parties against fraud. These powerful features
and dynamic ecosystem make Ethereum a strong
fit for Moozicore tokens.
