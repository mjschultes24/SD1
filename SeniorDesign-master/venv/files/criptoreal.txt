Money is an agreement, usually unconscious, made
by a community, to be used as a way of exchange.
Dollar as the global currency was something that
came at the end of 1945, after World War II. However,
when a contract does not work, it is necessary to
make the distract.
If society begins to question the efficiency of the
current financial model, we must consider creating
other means of exchange among the community
that avoid collapses.
Complementary   currencies   are   a   possibility,
functioning  in  parallel  with  those  already  in
circulation, such as the dollar, which could never be
totally eliminated
— Bernard Lietaer
on The Future of Money




ABSTRACT
Throughout the history of humanity, the need to make payments guided
the great economic revolutions. If in the early days the problems that
turned salt into exchange money were the little notion of value
equivalence and the difficulty of transportation, nowadays, in the
information age, the centralization of the financial system, abusive
contracts with acquirers, lack of transparency in the banking system, an
exclusionary economy and high corruption rates in government are the
precursors of the greatest economic revolution in history, the
cryptocurrencies.
INTRODUCTION
The current Brazilian financial system is centralized, bureaucratic, slow
and expensive. Such characteristics are extremely damaging to the growth
of an economy.
A recent IBGE survey found that out of every ten companies, six do not
survive after five years of activity, especially small businesses.
According to another survey conducted by SEBRAE, 60% of e-commerces
in Brazil ends its activities before completing one year of operation.
What is the influence of the current financial system on the short survival
time of these companies?

Bureaucracy to Open a Bank account for a Company.
To open a bank account, a company needs the following documents:
• Document of the incorporation of the company and its subsequent amendments. .
• Checking receipt for the CNPJ (Company Number).
• Checking receipt of company address.
• Checking receipt of the last 12 months revenue.
• Identification documents of the partners or legal representatives.
• Checking receipt of the partners or legal representatives addresses.
Opening this account is also conditioned on a risk analysis and the confirmation of the REGULAR situation of
the CPF (a Brazilian document with a unique number, like a Social Security Number) of the holders and legal
representatives, if applicable.
Another determining factor to open this bank account is the commercial interest of the banking institution
in that company.
Interestingly, waiting 15 days for this analysis and receiving a negative response because of commercial
disinterest is more common than you might think.
The Need for Credit Card Sales Acquiring Companies.
Acquirers are the credit card companies’ licensed members who review and accept merchants (online and
offline) in their financial transaction program.
Some examples of acquirers in Brazil are: Cielo, Rede, GetNet and Stone.
The credit card companies make contact with the banks that issue the cards.
When a transaction is approved by the bank, the card company returns this information to the acquirer, who
authorizes the purchase process with the merchant.
Usually, the transfer of the transaction’s value is made in 31 days (D + 30), counting from the moment of
purchase.
This accreditation process is time consuming, bureaucratic and financially abusive.

Interesting Facts:
• 90% of the Brazilian marketshare belongs to Cielo and Rede.
• Cielo and Rede belong to the four largest Brazilian banks (Cielo: Banco do Brasil, Caixa e Bradesco. Rede:
Itaú).
• Brazil is the largest market for cards acquirement in Latin America, adding in 2012, R$690 billion in card
sales.
• Considering the standard acquiring price, it is estimated that Brazil is the second largest acquiring market
in revenue, in the world.
• Almost 80% of all online purchases in Brazil are made with credit cards.
• The two largest cards, Visa holds 43% and MasterCard 32% of payments made today in Brazil.
Abusive fees charged by Acquirers to Intermediate Transactions.
They charge very high administration fees, do not offer the necessary support and still keep the most of the
money when the shopkeeper anticipates the receivables.
In addition to transaction fees, one of the main sources of profit for acquirers is the rental of credit and debit
card POS hardware used in physical stores. The use of those machines is charged monthly.
Even More Abusive Fees to Anticipate Receivables.
When a purchase is made via credit card, the merchant or service provider will receive the value of the
purchase in 31 days, but their tax and supplier obligations are usually before that, which is why most of the
businesses need to "anticipate" their sales, paying fees of up to 20%.

Lack of Security Regarding Receiving The Transactions Intermediated by
Acquirers.
Brazilian acquirers charge very high fees, but if a customer fraudulently cancels the transaction
(chargeback), the money loss will always be of the store/business, that is, acquiring companies own the
bonus and the store the burden.
It is worth mentioning that the rate of chargebacks due to online fraud across the planet is 0.6%, however,
Brazil is well above this number.
It is estimated that in our country this index is 3.50% - almost 6 times higher than the world average.
Chargebacks, with numbers well below our own, boosted, in a way, the birth of Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto
would be perplexed by all the problems that guide the Brazilian financial system.

Lack of Respect by the Acquirers.
In addition to all bureaucracy at the time of accreditation, abusive administration fees and the practical
stealing in anticipations, business owners still get a poor service.
Absurd cases like having "retained" sales funds without prior communication for 30, 60 and up to 180 days
are extremely common and often only get resolved in court (which could take up to 5 years in Brazil).

Registered Banking Tickets.
Febraban (Brazilian Federation of Banks), recently determined that all tickets generated by services or
commerce must be registered.
When a person makes a purchase through a banking ticket on the internet, for example, the shopkeeper
pays on average 2.00 Reais (about 0.75 USD ) only for this ticket issuing.
According to data from the E-Commerce News, the conversion of banking tickets in Brazil, regarding online
sales, does not exceed 50%.
“"The registration mode is more expensive for the company because it can be charged up to five different rates.
Shopkeepers who work with a large volume of tickets can negotiate good rates with banks, but the small ones
do not have that bargaining power.”  Carlos Moura, director of the Superlogical Growth sector.
Conclusion:
We believe that all the points explained above serve as complicating factors for Brazilian business economic
growth and the main foundation of these ties is the current financial system: centralized, slow, expensive,
corrupt and bureaucratic.
It is impossible to deny that the use of electronic payments brought great economic growth for the whole
country, but it is also undeniable that it faces major limitations.
The major one is the centralization of the credit card acquirers industry and its concentration in the
Brazilian banking sector.
Acquiring companies charge for three types of service:
1. Fees for card transactions.
2. Rental of equipment (POS).
3. Prepayment of transactions (anticipation of receivables).
12

However, the liquidation of card payment transactions and prepayment (anticipation) depend on the banks
to be fulfilled.
It is not a coincidence that the largest banks in the country are shareholders or have agreements with
acquiring companies that make difficult for new businesses to grow, making impossible to exist the
necessary competition that permits to shopkeepers to negotiate better rates and even have some kind of
improvement in attendance.
It is also very important to notice that Brazilian debit cards can not be used online.
Now let’s see how the same financial system interferes in the relation of consumption by the point of view of
the consumer, the physical person.

The Bureaucracy in Opening a Bank Account for Individuals.
While the number of people employed in the private sector with a formal contract declined by 194,000 at the
end of 2017, the total number of informal workers was increased by 411,000 in the same period.
The biggest problem with this type of situation is the lack of proof of income, one of the many documents
required to open a bank account.
According to the latest PNAD data, the number of employees with a formal contract in Brazil is 33.3 million,
while the category of employees in the private sector without a formal contract, estimated at 10.7 million
people, and informal workers were estimated in 22.6 million.
According to a survey conducted by the Data Popular Institute, a reference in research on popular
consumption and in the knowledge of Brazil, about 55 million Brazilians don’t have a bank account, which
represents about 39.5% of the country's population over 18 years old and they are approximately a R$ 655
billion market.
Lack of Credit.
As mentioned above, the only way to be an online consumer in Brazil is to own a credit card, debit cards are
not accepted and banking tickets are ineffective.
To get a credit card, a prior analysis of the applicant's credit profile is required.
People who are starting their financial life, people who have had troubles with credit before, people who do
not have a formal contract and people with a low credit score will hardly succeed in this analysis.
All of these people are excluded from online retailers who only accept credit cards as a form of payment or
are obligated to pay abusive prepaid card fees.

Bank Withdrawal Limits.
Normally, depending on the bank, from R$1.500,00 to R$2,500.00 can be withdrawn daily at ATMs and from
R$1,500,00 to R$5,000.00 directly at the cashier.
Now, if you need to withdraw more than $ 5,000.00 you need to make a previous communication to the
bank, schedule the day and explain the reason for the withdrawal.
The only conclusion we can have to these limits is that we have no control over our own money.
Financial Transactions Limits (TEDs, DOCs, Payments).
These are the maximum amounts, daily and monthly, defined for the payment transactions and transfers
carried out in the service channels of Brazilian banks.
Let's suppose that a great business opportunity shows up in your life and to take advantage of it, you need
an amount of money higher than the limit of daily financial movement imposed by your bank.
Unless you have an excellent relationship with your bank’s manager, you are more likely to miss this
opportunity.
Bank Fees.
Many people have no idea how much they spend per month and mainly per year just to be able to use their
own money.
Bank fees, which for bankers are a real gold mine, for customers are more to a large drain, where money
disappears without a trace.

Influence of the Financial System on Consumer
Behavior
For example, a customer who has an account with Banco do Brasil, Itaú, Santander, Bradesco or Caixa pays
between R$36,80 and R$39,00 per month to have a tariff package that includes items such as 3 DOCs / TEDs
(online transfers), 8 withdrawals and three extracts.
In the hypothetical case of someone who makes 10 TEDs per month in Bradesco, for example, the monthly
cost of this customer would be R$106,80.
This is because the customer would pay R$38,90 per month for the tariff package that includes three TEDs
and would have to pay for the other seven transfers, totaling another R$67,90 in one month.
In a year, that person would pay the bank no less than R$1.281,00 (about 125% the Brazilian minimum
wage) with these transactions alone.
All this without including other operations that could have additional costs, like withdrawals, extracts, etc.
Another interesting fact is the readjustment in the value of these services, which according to IDEC's latest
survey on banking services prices, increased by up to 78.9% between November 2016 and October 2017,
showing that most of the adjustments applied by banks in their rates were well above the inflation
measured in the same period.
This finding led the researchers to the following observation:
"An abusive price increase, without evidence of a significant improvement in the services rendered, points the
need to improve regulatory norms regarding price adjustment criteria” ( (IDEC - Brazilian Institute of
Consumer Protection, 2017).

Centralized and Political Dependent System

Centralized and Political Dependent System
Crises in the banking sector are recurrent and almost inexorable throughout the history of Brazilian banks.
The sector has a significant weakness, since it participates in the monetary domination of the state, creates
credit money, administers means of payment and performs compensation services.
In addition, banking institutions are extremely indebted, through a "chain of links," so that a crisis in only
one institution can easily become a general crisis of the whole banking system.
The relevance of the sector can also be explained by the strategic role it plays in the economy, through
financial intermediation and the financing of economic activities.
Bank crises affect the economy much more deeply than crises in companies of other sectors, as they affect
credit, interests, investments and the level of economic activity, causing capital escape and worsening the
problems in payments balance.
In addition, the solution of bank crises requires a large volume of public resources (Corazza, 2001).
In general, crises are caused by the combination of macroeconomic factors, such as an environment of
instability, and microeconomic factors.
Microeconomic weakness may be a consequence of poor asset quality resulting from bad management or
fraudulent practices, which in turn is mainly caused by system deficiencies.

Lack of Transparency.
The banks' lack of transparency facilitates corruption and tax evasion across the globe. This is the
conclusion of the research conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Consumer Protection (IDEC), which
analyzed 47 banks from seven countries.
According to IDEC consultant Lucas Salgado, in an interview with TVT reporter Vanessa Nakasato, problems
resulting from bank management practices directly affect investors, clients and their employees.
"Are harmed, the shareholder who is putting money in the bank and does not know if there are good practices
or financial sustainability, consumers who, from the deposits, lend their resources to the banks work, and even
the workers who may be in a company which has a vulnerable financial sustainability.”
System Subject to Provisory Measures and Political Interest.
Provisory Measure (MP) is an instrument with force of law, adopted by the President of the Republic, in cases
of relevance and urgency.
It produces immediate effects, but, fortunately, depends on the approval of the National Congress for final
transformation into law.
Unfortunately, most of the time, this support is exchanged for positions and political relevance among the
parties.
A great example of the impact of MPs on our lives was the Provisory Measure signed by Fernando Collor de
Mello the day after his inauguration, in which he announced the confiscation of all money deposited in
savings accounts.
At the time, the Economy Minister Zélia Cardoso de Mello, explained that who had more than fifty thousand
cruzeiros in savings would be with the amount deposited in the bank with the Central Bank under the
ownership of the individual or legal entity in the form of cruzados novos and the value would be converted
into cruzeiros after 18 months.
It was a moment of deep national perturbation that left in the memory of many the bitter taste of
impotence.

Mr. Collor de Mello is a 2018 elections presidential candidate.
Many believe that with Constitutional Amendment no. 32/2001, which changed the article 62 of the Federal
Constitution to prohibit the issuance of a provisory measure "aimed at the detention or seizure of assets, of
people’s savings or any other financial asset", a new confiscation may not occur but it is worth noting that
the amendment concerning confiscation prohibiting the issuance of a provisory measure does not eliminate
the hypothesis of confiscation by proposing a new law.
Lack of Political Credibility.
The influence of corruption on Brazilian economic development is proportional to all the obstacles created
by the centralized financial system in which we live.
The presence and influence of the government in the banking and financial system is very strong in Brazil,
which causes a low economic freedom and makes Brazilian growth impossible.
According to a study by Economic Freedom that analyzed 180 countries in 2017, Brazil occupies the 140th
place in the ranking of economic freedom, the country obtained 52.9 points and was classified in the "little
freedom" category.
Economic freedom brings greater prosperity.
The Economic Freedom Index documents the positive relationship between economic freedom and a
variety of positive social and economic goals.
The ideals of economic freedom are strongly associated with healthier societies, cleaner environments,
greater per capita wealth, human development, democracy and the elimination of poverty.
Lack of Security.
Throughout its history Brazil has had around 600 banking institutions, according to Coradi, today, there are
around one hundred.
Many have failed or merged with others to avoid bankruptcy.
"We are an incredible bank cemetery" says the author.

Between 1946 and 2016, 233 banks were liquidated or suffered juridical intervention from the Central Bank.
The biggest losers when these banks "die" are the small savers, investors and account holders, who almost
always do not get their money back or have to spend years struggling judicially to get at least something
back, almost never enough to cover court expenses.
Cases such as Bancesa, for example, will never be forgotten by those who suddenly saw their money
disappear.
Media Influence.
A news report published in the British newspaper "The Independent" accuses the Brazilian press of being
too partisan and causing damage to the country's political process.
The text published in '' The Independent '' is the latest and the longest to talk about a topic that already has
appeared on other occasions in the international media.
Journalists and foreign academics have evaluated the coverage of the Brazilian press, and criticism of
"partisanship" is usual.
The great truth of these statements is that, unfortunately, a large part of the Brazilian media releases news
according to their own interests.
The news below is a good demonstration of a practice widely used by the media in our country, the
half-truths.
The unemployment rate dropped to 12.6% as a result of the increase in the number of unemployed people who
began to work informally. The omission of such an important detail has the sole purpose of making up the true
economic situation of the country.
It is not a coincidence that many researches show that a large number of Brazilians have no idea of the
economic chaos we are living.

Conclusion:
We believe that the facts exposed above, point to two very important issues in the bonds imposed by the
current financial system on the economic growth of our country, the lack of interest to include in the system
the people who don’t have bank accounts and the little control that the Brazilian population has over its
own money.
Many studies have already shown that financial inclusion is the only effective tool to achieve sustainable
development and it can be said that these studies were more than corroborated by the use of local
currencies, also known as social currencies.
The existence of parallel monetary instruments is not a recent phenomenon. Throughout history, there have
been different forms and occasions in which parallel currencies have circulated, currently the most
widespread are social currencies.
In Brazil, social currencies have existed for more than 10 years; they were created by community banks in
order to make money from the residents circulate within the communities themselves, that is, to stimulate
the local consumption and thus generate employment and income in these regions.
The most famous of them is the one from Palmas, internationally recognized for its success.
The former director of the Central Bank of Belgium, one of the architects of the creation of the Euro,
consultant to multinationals and developing governments, Professor of Sustainable Development at the
University of Sorbonne, Bernard Lietaer, explains that complementary currencies are part of the era of
information.
“At the beginning of the industrial age, people said that everything would change, except the horses. Because
it was they who pulled the first machines and the first trains. Now, in the information age, people say that
everything will change, except money. But money is information. It's amazing how people believe that the
financial system will not change.”

Cryptocurrencies can now be considered parallel currencies and to some extent an evolution of social
currencies, as they not only have a high power of economic democratization but also have a huge potential
for disruption.
It is also worth noting that the potential for disruption of a cryptocurrency in the current financial sector is
much greater in Brazil than in other countries, not only for economic inclusion, ease of transactions and low
cost of use, but also as an ideal form of peaceful manifestation from the society to the political-economic
and especially moral crisis that plagues our country.

Introducing Criptoreal
Before we understand how our proposal is intended to minimize the problems mentioned before, we need
to explain how the platform works.
Technology
Criptoreal is a decentralized asset transfer platform that uses Distributed Ledger (Blockchain) technology
developed in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Such technology has become increasingly known due to the
adoption of Bitcoin and other similar platforms.
Our platform, specifically, is derived from another great technological advance in the same area, Dash,
which, since 2014, has been adding great improvements to the technology invented by Nakamoto.
As other decentralized platforms based on the invention of Nakamoto, Criptoreal, also has its own active,
this active, popularly known as "cryptocurrency", has the same name of the platform, Criptoreal and its
symbol is CRS.
Blockchain
The blockchain containing transactions performed in the Criptoreal platform is verified through the system
known as Proof of Work, where a computer solves mathematical equations based on the hash of the last
block accepted by its peers.
26




CriptoReal
WHITEPAPER
Introducing Criptoreal
When a computer finds the solution to the mathematical equation and it is validated by its peers, it receives
a predetermined amount of new Criptoreal.
Due to its similarity to the process of searching for precious metals, this activity is popularly known as
mining.
The algorithm used in the Criptoreal’s proof of work is Lyra2z, derived from Lyra2 invented in Brazil by
students of EPUSP, this algorithm is known worldwide for its cost x benefit ratio, being extremely safe and
economical at the same time.
Due to its characteristics, Lyra2z encourages the mining of Criptoreal by small miners and keeps the chain of
blocks totally decentralized, this is specially good for Brazilians because of the high cost of electricity.
27




CriptoReal
WHITEPAPER
Introducing Criptoreal
Masternodes
One of the major problems of proof of work only based peer to peer platforms is the lack of incentive for a
peer to maintain an entire copy of the blockchain, with time and adoption, the size of the chain and the
amount of data sent between peers begin to grow, making it impracticable for most peers to maintain the
full chain, they choose to use what is known as thin wallets, which makes unnecessary to maintain the full
blockchain locally installed.
This interferes negatively in the speed of communication between the pairs of the network, as shown by the
graph below of the Bitcoin Network.
T
fi
By stimulating peers, the Proof of Service allows, in the medium and long term, regardless of the size of the
blockchain, that the speed of communication between the network is not affected.
28




CriptoReal
WHITEPAPER
Introducing Criptoreal
Any network peer can participate in the Proof of Service program, the only requirements are, a fixed IP
address, a fast and constant connection to the internet, enough disk space to accommodate the complete
blockchain and a collateral of CRS 50000.
As an incentive, the platform automatically distributes 50% of the new Criptoreal found by miners (Proof of
Work) with the holders of these nodes (Proof of Service) and these nodes are popularly known as
MasterNodes.
There is only one soft limit, imposed by the collateral, for the creation of masternodes and it is the amount
generated of Criptoreal per day, approximately 86,400, that is, if you put together all Criptoreal generated by
the network in one day, the maximum amount of masternodes created will be approximately 1.7 per day or
620 masternodes per year.
This is very important to avoid attacks where 51% of the masternodes belong to the same peer, being able
to abuse of the network.
The return on investment of a masternode depends on the number of active masternodes in the network
and can be calculated as follows:
(n/t)*r*b*a
Onde:
n  is the number of Masternodes that an operator controls
t    is the total number of Masternodes
r    is the Reward per block (currently 120 CRS)
b  is the average number of blocks per day. In the Criptoreal network is 720.
a  is the Masternode payment average (50% of the average Reward of each block)
As we explained above, masternodes are important for maintaining communication agility among all
network peers, but that’s not all, masternodes also allow the transfer of resources instantly, a feature known
as InstaSend.
29




CriptoReal
WHITEPAPER
Introducing Criptoreal
InstaSend is fundamental to the adoption of CriptoReal in retail for not relying on confirmations of the
whole network, only a minimum number of masternodes that validate a transfer in under 2 seconds.
Another benefit of masternodes is the ability to merge resources to later use the PrivateSend feature, which
is critical to maintain the anonymity of network peers that so desire.
Compared to a traditional currency, all Criptoreal units are the same, regardless of their origin, the merge
service serves to obfuscate, in a decentralized way, the origin of the assets in their wallet.
Unlike platforms that are exclusively anonymous, Criptoreal users have the option of being anonymous or
not.
Here are two practical examples for the different cases:
1-) The "Criptoreal" foundation is a transparent entity and has a unique Criptoreal address for donations.
This address can be audited by anyone, you just need to access a blockchain explorer, such as
www.criptoreal.info
2-) Pedro is an individual and likes his right to privacy, he receives Criptoreal and chooses to use
PrivateSend so that no one can know the origin or destination of his funds.
Future
A small sample of what's to come on our platform.
Going beyond what is already possible to do with Criptoreal, the platform was launched with an
implemented system of decentralized governance that will be activated in January 2019, approximately one
year after the creation of the genesis (first block) of the chain.

CriptoReal
WHITEPAPER
Introducing Criptoreal
From the activation of the decentralized governance system, the network will begin to create superblocks
that will collect ten percent of all mined blocks.
At this time, all network peers can submit project proposals through their wallets and an official website, the
only requirement to submit a proposal is the payment of 5 CRS.
From the moment a proposal is sent, masternode owners have 30 days to vote, they can either support
(yes), reject (no) or even abstain.
If the proposal is accepted by a majority of the votes, the address that sent the proposal receives the
necessary funds to execute it, automatically, without human intervention.
Practical example:
Marcel sends a proposal to create a video teaching how to accept Criptoreal in e-commerce stores. To
create the video, John asks for 300 CRS, he pays the submitting fee which is 5 CRS and the
masternodes have 30 days to vote.
When the deadline expires, if most of the masternodes supported John's initiative, the system
automatically distributes 300 CRS to John's wallet.
If most of the masternodes rejected John's proposal, he receives nothing and the funds are
accumulated to finance other proposals.

Our Goal

CriptoReal
WHITEPAPER
Our Goal
There are hundreds of new blockchain technology-based projects being rolled out across the globe and this
number tends to grow as technology matures and gains new adepts.
Sometimes, we see that participants of different projects believe that there is no room for more than one
project, we disagree with this point of view and believe that any transparent, suitable and viable project
only improves the quality of life of its users.
We want make it clear that Criptoreal does not pretend to be "the new Bitcoin".
Our goal in developing and making this project freely available is simply an attempt to minimize the afore
mentioned problems that haunt our country, through a robust and transparent platform.
So far, we do not know of any similar project that has such an objective as its main priority, but we hope that
over time, more Brazilian professionals in the area can develop solutions that aim to help our country.
Having said that and considering that now you know the basic functioning of our platform, see in the next
section how Criptoreal will help the Brazilian population.

CriptoReal
WHITEPAPER
Our Goal
How We Intend To Solve Bureaucracy For Both, Companies and
Individuals
Criptoreal can be used by anyone, regardless of gender, race, religion and financial condition, just by having
access to the internet.
Imagine that the Criptoreal wallet is your wallet, the one in your pocket, for you to take money from that
wallet, you do not need to talk to anyone; to open that wallet, you do not need to show any documentation
and, more importantly, to put money in that wallet, you do not need anyone's authorization.
What you do with your Criptoreal wallet is also entirely your responsibility, this is how the financial freedom
that Criptoreal offers works.
Elimination of Intermediaries
Transactions on the Criptoreal platform are always peer-to-peer, there is no need for any intermediary, such
as acquiring companies, which is the case of credit cards and banking tickets.
Just like when you take money out of your wallet to pay for bread at the bakery, you send and receive with
the Criptoreal wallet, peer to peer and without intermediaries.
Agility on Receiving Funds
Generally, a normal Criptoreal transaction is confirmed by the network in up to two minutes and a transfer
using InstaSend technology is confirmed in under two seconds.
As on the examples mentioned above, Criptoreal works just like when you pay or receive a service in cash,
instantly.
In the case of small merchants and service providers, instantly means without waiting a month for a
company that does not care about your business, give you your own money and charges you for doing it.
34




CriptoReal
WHITEPAPER
Our Goal
Fraud
Criptoreal transactions are irreversible and auditable, eliminating the possibility of fraud by people who act
with bad intentions and who usually buy products or hire services to just after doing it request a chargeback
on their credit card.
On the other hand, the possibility of generating Criptoreal addresses with multiple signatures (MultiSig),
allows the creation of smart contracts guaranteeing the protection of the consumer.
Continuing the comparison with cash transfers, when you pay or receive for a service or product, that
transfer is final and uncontested.
Cost
Without intermediaries, with no risk of fraud and no centralized structure, Criptoreal transactions cost up to
2,000 times less than transactions carried out by centralized institutions.
If Brazilian entrepreneurs can, with the current situation, offer discounts for in cash or banking tickets sales,
imagine what it will be like when they start accepting Criptoreal on their business.
People Without Bank Accounts and Financially Excluded
Financial status, place of residence or credit history of those using Criptoreal is irrelevant to the platform.
No cost to use, no documentation to file and no human intervention, you can start receiving and sending
payments to and from anywhere in the world once you've installed the wallet.
Brazil is a continent-sized country, it is physically and financially impossible for banks to serve 100% of the
population, but with advances in satellite internet and projects like Google's Loon, the possibility of a 100%
connected Brazil is a near and viable reality.
The big problem is that, as we showed before, until today, it took much more than just a simple internet
connection for a Brazilian citizen to be financially included.
35




CriptoReal
WHITEPAPER
Our Goal
How many people are not consumers or suppliers because of the bureaucracy involved in the transfer of
money?
It is exactly for these people that Criptoreal will be revolutionary!
Limits
There are no limits to Criptoreal transfers.
Going back to the examples of the traditional wallet we are used to carry in our pocket, the one who used to
have money inside, the contents of that wallet, whatever it is, is yours, no one should have the right to
control how much and on which way you spend your money.
Transparency and Security
The platform is independent of political and financial interests, is self-sustaining and decentralized, there is
no single point of failure.
