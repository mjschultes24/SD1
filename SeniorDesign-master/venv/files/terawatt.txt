Overview
Terawatt is a patent-pending, renewable energy blockchain startup, with a
strong focus on monetization and driving global L.E.D. adoption.
Terawatt will create a DAO, and also a deflationary Ethereum-based, private
(zk-SNARKS) currency for global payments.
The DAO will be funded and used by Utility Companies, L.E.D. Sellers,
Businesses, token holders, and energy customers worldwide. The DAO
will act like a                                                                     decentralized global insurance fund   to ensure Utilities
(and  businesses)  always  have  access  to  funding  (which  constantly
runs out) for subsidizing L.E.D. sales to their energy customers (or for
businesses and people to overcome the upfront cost of upgrading to
L.E.D.s).
Total Supply: 100 Million Tokens
Circulating Supply: 65 million ( supply will decrease exponentially in an s-curve
fashion to as low as 1 million tokens over time).
This is due to our continuous coin burning algorithm. Terawatt will automatically
use 50-75% of company profits earned from DAO entry/exit fees, (no exit fee if
LED purchase is verified), profit taking fees (like an exchange), carbon tax data
storage fees, purchase record access fees  (for businesses using our tokens as
payment), carbon credits, and even from affiliate L.E.D. sales commissions to
buyback and burn (LED) Tokens.
This is similar to the BNB token, but they only burn every quarter,
We Will Burn 24/7.

Utilities and other businesses will want to accept our tokens for payments
because our rate of deflation is much greater than all FIAT currencies and
most, if not all, cryptocurrencies/tokens while also being more private and
secure  with  zk-SNARKS  and  masternodes  when  available.  They  can  also
reduce accounting costs as all transaction data will be stored securely on
the decentralized ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, the more tokens they
have to enter into the DAO fund, the more voting power, profits, and staking
rewards they can receive. This may further increase token value due to the
network effect. (Metcalfe's Law)

Abstract
Goal:
Leverage  blockchain  technology  to  help  reduce  global  lighting  electricity
consumption                                                                          50  percent   (roughly   2000  Terawatts)  by   2035,  while  also
increasing light output by 50 percent. Terawatt will also create a deflationary
currency to compete with FIAT and digital alternatives like Bitcoin. Terawatt
aims to tackle other renewable sectors like Solar, Wind, Electric Vehicles
after proof of concept is achieved with L.E.D.s.
Method:
Method 1
Terawatt will create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization  (DAO), and also
create a highly deflationary Ethereum based currency for global payments. The
DAO will be funded and used by Utility Companies, L.E.D. Sellers, Businesses,
Token  Holders,  and  Energy  Customers  worldwide.  The  DAO  will  act  as  a
decentralized global mutual/insurance fund to ensure Utilities (and businesses)
always have access to funding (which constantly runs out) for subsidizing L.E.D.\
sales to their energy customers (or for businesses upgrading to L.E.D.s).
This is a major benefit to utility companies as they want 100 percent of their
customers to have energy efficient lights due to progressive grid overload,
which forces power companies to build (and maintain) expensive (Hundreds
of millions of dollars) power plants to meet demand. They are also mandated
by government agencies (i.e. US Department of Energy and US Environmental
Protection Agency) to increase L.E.D. adoption in their respective markets.
Businesses want L.E.D.s because they reduce electricity bills, increase light
output, reduce maintenance costs, and qualify them for tax incentives. The
upfront cost was the issue, but Terawatt will help overcome this.
Method 2
The Terawatt Token will also be used as a currency similar to ETH at any business
or utility company that will accept it as method of payment. DAO members with
businesses will want to accept Terawatt tokens as payment because they will gain
increased voting/staking power in the DAO, and because it's much more deflationary
than FIAT or other cryptocurrencies due to continual coin burning structure, which
equals potentially increased profitability.

The  power  companies,  and  other token  holders,  will buy  into  the  DAO with  our
tokens,  we’ll  charge  a  fee  for  entering  and  exiting,  and  when  they  sell  their
position, we take a percentage of their profits  (like a mutual fund or an exchange
does). We will take  50-75% of these profits to buyback and burn our own tokens
daily  (per  transaction  depending).  With  Terawatt,  all  people  and  businesses  can
have uninterrupted access to inexpensive/free L.E.D.s which substantially decreases
their purchasing costs, electricity bills, increases global lighting efficiency, and in
turn reduces global greenhouse emissions.
The  (LED) token will may or may not exponentially increase in value as more
power companies  (and buyers/energy customers/other companies) realize the
advantages of using our tokens and of joining the DAO (Metcalfe’s Law), thereby
increasing demand while also decreasing supply.
Through DAO utilization, key partnerships ( We are actively pursuing collaborations
and  partnerships  with  utility  companies  globally)                                       ,  deflationary  supply,  token
incentives,  and  voracious  marketing,  Terawatt  aims  to  help  put  L.E.D.s  in  all
commercial, industrial (street lights), government and residential buildings/facilities
worldwide and e fficiently increase the changeover from less efficient Incandescent,
Metal Halide (MH), High Pressure Sodium (HPS), and Compact Fluorescent Lighting
(CFL) to 100% L.E.D. lighting (Light Emitting Diode).
Token holders will also be able to find and utilize applicable instant tax rebates,
search for tax credits, and then securely store this purchase data on the network
for later use in filing their taxes. Participants can buy, sell, stake with masternodes
(when available), vote, donate, or hold (LED) tokens, which will power the Terawatt
Ecosystem.

“The rapid adoption of LEDs in lighting marks one of the fastest 1 technology
shifts in human history,” Goldman Sachs stated in a new report.
The  accelerated  deployment  of light-emitting  diode  (LED)  bulbs  is  on track to
save U.S. consumers and businesses $20 billion a year in electricity costs within
a decade, which would lower U.S. CO2 emissions by some 100 million metric tons
a year! The growing global effort to speed up LED adoption could ultimately cut
global energy costs and carbon pollution 5 times as much.
Let’s look at some key charts and facts that illustrate the LED lighting  “miracle,”
which is every bit as remarkable — and every bit as unheralded by the major media
— as the solar miracle , the battery miracle , and the electric vehicle miracle .

As recently as 2009, this country didn’t have even 400,000 installations of common
home LED bulbs,  according to the November  2015 Department of Energy report
“Revolution… Now The Future Arrives for Five Clean Energy Technologies.” And yet
by 2012, we had 14 million — and by 2014 we had whopping 78 million installations.
This revolution has been driven by  “sharp cost reductions and performance
improvements, relatively short replacement cycles for incumbent technologies,
and aggressive policy support  (including bans on incandescent technology in
major markets such as the U.S., the E.U. and China),” as Goldman Sachs has
detailed in its recent reports on “ The Low Carbon Economy .”
Since 2008 alone, prices for LED light bulbs have dropped a remarkable 90 percent,
and you can now buy a 60-watt-equivalent LED bulb for a little more than $3.
Goldman forecasts “that LEDs will account for 69 percent of light bulbs sold and
over 60 percent of the installed global base by 2020.” This chart of where LEDs
have been and where Goldman Sachs projects they are going in the near term is
from their July 20 report, “The Low Carbon Economy: Our Thesis In 60 CHARTS.”
It compares LED adoption with the adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles and
solar PV and wind.

Currently the best LED bulbs cut electricity use by  85 percent compared to
incandescent light bulbs and by 40 percent compared to fluorescent lights. By
2020, Goldman expects those savings to increase to over 90 percent and  50
percent respectively.
At the same time, LEDs can last for up to 5 years of nonstop use — or a few decades
if used just a few hours a day. This is 50 times longer than incandescents and some 3
to 7 times longer than fluorescents. At the same time, LED bulbs provide superior
light quality than compact fluorescent lights (CFLs). For all these reasons and more,
GE announced earlier this year it would stop making CFLs “for the U.S. market and
instead focus its consumer lighting efforts on LED lamps.”
With the initial price dropping sharply while the ultra-low lifecycle costs also keep
dropping, you end up with a revolution — one that is happening even faster in the
United States:

With such an unprecedented technology revolution, it’s no wonder that, in  2014,
the Nobel Committee awarded the Physics Prize to three scientists for their 1990s
invention of “efficient blue light-emitting diodes [LEDs], which has enabled a bright,
energy-saving white light source.”
And in case you think that one small product you can hold in the palm of your
hand can’t be a game-changer in the arena of energy and climate solutions, think
again. The nation’s total electricity bill for residential and commercial customers
is now more than $320 billion . Of that about 15 percent is lighting — nearly $50
billion a year.
Goldman Sachs projected last month that LED lights “are on track to cut power
consumption for lighting… by over 40 percent.” That would provide annual savings
of more than $20 billion for consumers and businesses within a decade. And that
in turn would reduce U.S. CO2 emissions by some 100 million metric tons a year.

I  have  previously  noted  that  electricity  sales  in  this  country  have  been  flat  for
nearly a decade even as the economy has kept growing. This shift has been driven
federal energy efficiency standards for appliances (including lighting) and a growing
embrace of policies to promote efficiency at the state level.
Clearly, the LED lighting revolution will help ensure that trend continues for at
least one more decade. Indeed, the only plausible way the United States could
return to an era of significant electricity demand growth is if the electric vehicle
revolution takes off in the 2020s, which as we’ve seen is entirely possible, if not
likely.
The energy and climate benefits of LEDs are so large, it’s no wonder the U.S.
Department of Energy has been working to advance the technology and promote
their deployment for over 15 years. And it’s no surprise the DOE has worked with
countries like India on technical and analytic approaches to rapidly accelerate
their adoption of LED lights.
Indeed, most of the major countries in the world have adopted policies that have
sped  up  the  adoption  of  LEDs,  the  most  important  of which  have  been  the
mandatory phaseout of inefficient incandescent lights:

On top of all that, in 2015, the world’s energy ministers embraced a Global Lighting
Challenge , which is “a global race to accelerate phase-in of high efficiency, high-
quality  and  affordable  advanced  lamps  and  lighting  systems  with  a  target  of
achieving  cumulative  global  sales  of  10  billion  such  units  as  fast  as  possible.”
LED lighting will be a central focus.
As with solar energy, advanced batteries, and electric vehicles, the LED lighting
revolution may not be televised by the major media, but it is happening at a torrid
pace nonetheless — with a big boost from government deployment policies.”2

LED’s  have  the  potential  to  fundamentally  change  the  future  of  lighting  in  the
United  States,  and  abroad.  Residential  LEDs,  especially  ENERGY  STAR  rated
products, use at least 75% less energy, and last 25 times longer, than incandescent
lighting.
Widespread use of LED lighting has the greatest potential impact on energy savings
in the United States. By 2027, widespread use of LEDs could save about 348 TWH
(compared to  no  LED  use)  of electricity: This  is the  equivalent  annual electrical
output of                                                                                    44 large electric power plants   (1000 megawatts each), and a total savings
of more than                                                                                 $30 billion                      at today's electricity prices.3

Electricity Sector Emissions
Total Emissions in 2015 = 6,587 Million Metric Tons of CO2 equivalent
Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry in the United States is a net sink and
offsets approximately 11.8 percent of these greenhouse gas emissions, not included
in total above. All emission estimates from the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas
Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2015 .
The Electricity sector involves the generation, transmission, and distribution of
electricity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes up the vast majority of greenhouse gas
emissions from the sector, but smaller amounts of methane  (CH4) and nitrous
oxide  (N2O) are also emitted. These gases are released during the combustion
of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to produce electricity. Less than
1  percent  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  the  sector  come  from  sulfur
hexafluoride (SF6) , an insulating chemical used in electricity transmission and
distribution equipment.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the Electricity Sector by Fuel Source
Coal combustion is generally more carbon intensive than burning natural gas or
petroleum for electricity. Although coal accounted for about  70 percent of CO2
emissions from the sector, it represented only about 34 percent of the electricity
generated in the United States in 2015. Another 32 percent of electricity generated
in  2015 was generated using natural gas, an increase relative to  2014. Petroleum
accounted for less than 1 percent of electricity generation in 2015. The remaining
generation in 2015 came from non-fossil fuel sources including nuclear (about 20
percent) and renewable sources (about 13 percent), which include hydroelectricity,
biomass, wind, and solar. These other sources usually release fewer greenhouse
gas emissions than fossil fuel combustion, if any emissions at all.
Emissions and Trends
In 2015, the electricity sector was the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas
emissions, accounting for about 29 percent of the U.S. total. Greenhouse gas
emissions
from electricity have increased by about 4 percent since 1990 as electricity
demand has grown and fossil fuels have remained the dominant source for
generation.

LED lighting solutions have never been more accessible or affordable than now.
With multiple rebate programs and incentives, more cities are making the switch
to LED street lighting. And why wouldn’t they? As we all know by now, LEDs are
energy-efficient and long-lasting which means huge savings on the energy bill as
well as reduced maintenance costs. But what about the other benefits? Such as
reduced  crime  rate,  safer  neighborhoods,  and  overall  perceived  improvement?
These are all benefits that LED street lighting can offer compared to the orangey
glow of the high pressure sodium (HPS) street lighting still illuminating most of our

SAFER STREETS
The biggest difference between LEDs and HPS lights (other than the energy savings,
of course) is the overall appearance of the light. LEDs not only feature a crisp color
similar to moonlight/natural light (anywhere from 4000K to 6000K), but also a great
Color Rendering Index (CRI) of at least 70. This is hugely important because the CRI
is what determines the visibility and ability to see things as intended. The CRI for
HPS lights, in comparison, can be as low as 20. This makes visibility “muddier” and
more difficult to discern detail and color. When visibility is decreased, so is safety\
which means an increase in crime. Visibility is an obviously important factor when it
comes to lighting streets and neighborhoods at night. Take a look at this chart that
compares basic statistics between LED street lighting and HPS.

CASE STUDY : PORTLAND SAVING
$100K PER MONTH
Portland, Oregon recently converted  20,000 city street lights to LED in the largest
efficiency  upgrade  the  city  has  undergone.  Savings  from  the  program  have  now
topped                                                                                     $100,000   per month  and those  monthly savings will continue to  grow as
more lights are converted. The money saved can be utilized to improve infrastructure
(i.e.  roads, water lines,  and sewer lines) without the need of raising taxes.  Re ad
more here .
CASE STUDY: LOS ANGELES REACHES ANNUAL SAVINGS OF
$8.7 MILLION
Los Angeles  , California began a huge installation of 140,000 LED street lamps in
2009.  Since the conversion from HPS to LEDs, the city has recorded up to  63%
energy savings and cost savings of $8.7 million this past year. The cost savings are
the result of not only a savings in electricity cost, but a reduction i n maintenance
costs  as  well.  As  an  article  on  Forbes  reports,                                    “In        2008,  pre-LED  roll-out,
Los Angeles logged 70,000 street light repair and maintenance events; in FY 2012,
maintenance  and  repair  events  fell  to  46,300.  LEDs  are  longer  lived  than  the
incumbent  units  they  replace  (10-15  years  versus  4-6  years),  which  means  that
maintenance should steadily decline as LED units are fully deployed.” Again, savings
in energy costs and maintenance equates to a minimization in tax increases and
revised budgets with money allocated to much needed and often put
off infrastructure repairs. R ead the entire Forbes article on LA’s LED

LEDs Vs CFLs and Incandescent Bulbs
I think it's fair to say that most people and businesses understand LEDs are more
efficient,  can  reduce  their  electricity  bills,  and  are  generally  better  for  the
environment. However, most LED buyers are not aware they could have utilized
local city/state tax rebates to reduce the purchase price by 50-80 percent, and
also that they can apply for a tax credit at the end of the year (as always, consult
with your local tax professional). Take a quick look at the table below:

While prices for LED light bulbs were astronomical just a few years ago — upwards
of  $100 for one  bulb  — you  can  now pick up  a cheap,  60-watt-equivalent  LED
light bulb for less than  $5  . They will become even less expensive as technology
advances.
Incandescent light bulbs are being phased out: An almost complete ban on their
sale started in 2014 and will take full effect in 2020. Simply put, they waste a lot of
energy and don’t last very long.

Even though CFL’s are better than incandescents, LEDs are the superior option in
every area. Modern CFLs also contain a small amount of mercury, which is very
harmful to  both your health  and the  environment. That  means  it’s  bad  news to
break one  (  here’s  how to  clean  it  up  safely if you  do  ),  and they shouldn’t  be
disposed of in your regular household trash ( here’s how to recycle them ). If these
bulbs are not properly disposed the mercury could contaminate groundwater which
we use as a source for drinking water. This is just some of the severity we face if
CFL’s are not properly disposed.
LEDs: Light-Emitting Diodes
Light-emitting  diodes,  or  LEDs,  were  for  years  most  commonly  found  in  small
electronic displays, such as the clock on your cable box. Because the light emitted
by each tiny LED is directional and fairly weak, household LED bulbs were on the
fringe of mainstream technology just a few years ago.
According  to  the  Lighting  Research  Center  ,  LED  light  bulbs  work  by  bringing
together  currents  with  a  positive  and  negative  charge  to  create  energy  released
in the form of light. The result is a fast source of light that is reliable, instantaneous,
and able to be dimmed. What sets LEDs apart from incandescent bulbs and CFLs is
just how long they can last. According to Consumer Reports  , LED light bulbs can
last  anywhere from  20,000 to  50,000 hours,  or up to five times  longer than any
comparable  bulb  on  the  market.  However,  that  combination  of  efficiency  and
durability has historically come at a cost. LEDs cost more money than CFLs and
incandescent  bulbs.  The  good  news,  however,  is  that  their  price  has  dropped
considerably over the years, as seen in the table above.
Where once it was common to pay $50 or even $100 for an LED light bulb, they’re
now available for about $8 a bulb on Amazon . IKEA sells its own 60W-equivalent
LED light bulbs for just $5 , and Home Depot is reportedly running a promotion in
May that will discount Philips LED light bulbs to as low as $2.50 per bulb, and that's
before rebates, token incentives from Terawatt, tax credits, and tax deductions

How Much Could You Save?
Now consider that those savings are from just one bulb. Think about the number
of lights in your house  — some fixtures, like chandeliers or ceiling fans, probably
even use three bulbs or more. If you replaced 20 incandescent bulbs with LED light
bulbs throughout your home, you could save up to $3,260 over their 23-year lifespan
(and that’s assuming utility rates don’t rise).
Now lets see what the savings will be if every house in the US converted to LEDs
Sample Home Test Results
(40 Light Bulbs, 40 LED Bulbs)
You have the same number of light fixtures as the average U.S. household.
You use                                                                                33.6 more           efficient bulbs than the average.
You are likely                                                                         saving      about   $127.44                             more than the average U.S. household each year
on lighting energy, due to your choice of bulbs.
If every household in the United States took the same steps on lighting efficiency
$
it would save $14,400,695,050 in energy costs.
it would be like shutting down 20 coal power plants.
it would be like talking 15,587,765 cars off the road.
it would reduce Co2   emissions by 79,497,604 metric tons.
it would cut emissions equivalent to 432,876 railcars of coal.

The savings are exponentially greater when you then apply this same data to
business, commercial, and industrial applications. Energy efficiency, blockchain
technology, and sustainability are growing trends that show no signs of slowing
down.
Other Ways to Compare CFL vs. LED
Light Bulbs
Let’s put cost aside for a moment and look at these lighting options based solely
on quality and other important factors. Here are some pros and cons of CFLs vs.
LEDs:
CFL Light Bulbs
Pros:
Use less energy than incandescent bulbs
Cost less than LED light bulbs
Produce extremely bright light that spreads evenly
Available in soft, warm, and bright white hues
Cons:
Cannot be used with a dimmer switch
Take a few moments to heat up and reach full brightness
Contain mercury, a toxic heavy metal
Can be sensitive to cold temperatures

LED Light Bulbs
Pros:
Light up immediately, like an incandescent bulb
Don’t heat up much at all - they stay cool to the touch even after use
Last up to five times longer than CFLs; can literally last a lifetime
No sensitivity to cold temperatures
Do not contain mercury
Some models can be used with a dimmer switch
Available in soft, warm, and bright white hues
Cons:
Directional light that may not spread as evenly as other sources
In some cases, more expensive to purchase up front, but less
expensive overall
CFL vs. LED Light Bulbs : Who Wins?
After conducting research using my own personal experience and expert sources
like                                                                                  Consumer Reports   and   EnergyStar.gov, I’ve concluded that it’s hard to beat
the value offered by modern LEDs. Not only are their prices getting more affordable
every day, they also lasts up to decades longer than the competition.
With soft and warm white hues that mimic the glow of traditional incandescent
bulbs,  the  ability  to  use  some  models  with  a  dimmer  switch,  and  their
instantaneous illumination, LEDs are simply a better option around the house
than CFLs.

Personally, I have all LEDs in my home. Prices for LEDs are lower than they’ve
ever been (and continue to get more competitive), and they are the most durable,
efficient home lighting option on the market. It’s hard to argue against a product
that more than pays for itself in energy savings and might last for the rest of your
life.
You don’t have to make a huge commitment now. If you want, you can upgrade to
more efficient lighting one room at a time, or as old light bulbs burn out. Or start
with installing an LED light bulb in a hard-to-reach spot, like a cathedral ceiling
fixture, since you won’t have to replace it for many, many years.
There is no right or wrong way to make the switch. But the sooner you do, the
sooner you’ll start saving.
In  short,  It’s  easy to  see that we  can  have  a dramatically positive  effect  on  our
environment (and our wallets!) by simply changing our light bulbs to more efficient
LED ones. The above example is a small one, however, imagine if everyone in the
world made the switch! The US, China, and Asia-Pacific countries are the biggest
offenders, with the bulk of the lighting being used in the Commercial and Residential
sectors  (businesses  and  homes)  It’s  also  extremely  cost  effective,  often  greatly
reducing electric bills, is profitable over time, and it helps save the environment.

Funding Problem/Solution
Terawatt Decentralized LED DAO Project
“Lighting Efficiency Decentralized”
Problem:
Significant upfront costs to upgrade to LEDs for businesses and consumers, and
also, electrical grids get overloaded as electricity consumption continues to grow
with the population as well as our increased reliance on electricity. This is likely to
continue to become an even greater issue as more electric vehicles hit the market.
To meet this demand power/utility companies have to build expensive additional
power  plants                                                                               (hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars).  OR,  what  they  are  doing  is
incentivising their customers to upgrade to LED lighting, (and other energy efficient
appliances,  devices,  building  methods,  etcetera)  Power  companies  are  even
encouraging their customers to consider solar panels or provide their own electricity
somehow. Sounds counterintuitive right? It makes sense though when you realize
how expensive it is to build and mainatain a new power plant versus just having
your  customers  change  their  light  bulbs.  Also,  in  the  US,  power  companies  are
mandated by the EPA to incentivise the changeover from CFL’s to all LED because
CFLs contain mercury! Most people do not recycle them either because it's easier
to just throw them in the trash.
I spoke to DUKE energy, one of the largest utility companies in the USA and world,
and they are even giving LED’s away for FREE! Up to six bulbs and the rest are
heavily discounted. This tells us they REALLY need their entire user base to adopt
LEDS  (and  other  energy  star  rated  appliances,  building  materials,  switch  to
renewable energy sources, etcetera)
The power companies are given funds by the State and Federal governments, and
also  use  their  own  money  (TECO  is  investor/privately  owned  for  example)  to
subsidize the cost of the LEDs. DUKE energy for example, it's worth it for them to
offer their customers  1 million dollars worth of free LED bulbs, if it helps them
avoid building a  200 million dollar power plant, and also paying to maintain it.
Power  companies  are  required  to  incentivise  the  changeover  from  Mercury
containing CFL’s to Clean LEDs to maintain compliance with the EPA!

The power companies usually run these programs until they run out of funding to
subsidize the cost  of the LEDs.  I  have seen some utility providers like Century
Hudson only offering the instant tax rebates (discounted prices essentially) for 3-4
months out of the year. Upon speaking with them, they of course would like to
have this available for the entire year, but simply run out of funds depending on
their budgets.
Power companies only usually allow their current customers to access these
discounts because they are paying for it, and want to primarily reduce their
electricity usage through increased lighting (electrical) efficiency. So it wouldn't
make sense for them to offer this subsidized cost to other power companies’
customers. Hm...a challenge!
The Decentralized Terawatt DAO Solution:
What is a DAO? Is this something new?
The DAO is a next-generation organisation that will change the way we create
products and share profit.
“ The DAO is now the biggest crowdfunded project of all time. In less than a month
the organisation has a market cap of $140 million. So what is the DAO really? And
why should you care? Simply put, the DAO is a self-running company. It has no
directors, no managers and no employees — at least not in the conventional sense
of  the  words.  DAO  stands  for  ‘Decentralised  Autonomous  Organisation’  and  it’s
powered by a crypto currency called                                                          Ethereum.   To better understand how the DAO
works requires a quick explanation of Ethereum. This is the future of trust..
Money  is  the  second  most  important  thing  human  beings  have  invented,  after
language.  More  than  just  a way  of buying  things,  currency  is  a  symbol  of trust.
Until now, that trust has relied on central authorities, like banks, for verification.
We no longer need those monolithic entities thanks to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
Ethereum,  like  Bitcoin,  is  a  cryptocurrency  and,  like  other  cryptocurrencies,
Ethereum  is  built  on  a  blockchain.  What  makes  Ethereum  different,  however,  is
that it has been designed as a platform for  ‘smart contracts’, allowing anyone to
create a trust agreement without requiring middlemen.
Bitcoin was designed to be both a currency and asset. Its blockchain can also be
used for other forms of transactions or contracts, but it isn’t easy to build out
these applications yet. Ethereum, on the other hand, was designed for contracts
from  the  get-go  and  makes  it  easier  for  developers  to  build  applications
accordingly.

Enter the DAO
With Ethereum gaining traction, the scene was set for a new kind of organisation.
The DAO uses Ethereum smart contracts to power everything from its funding to
how it pays people for the work they do. Like a traditional company, the DAO is
built for profit. It is seeded via the sale of ‘DAO tokens’ during the crowdfunding
period ending 28 May 2016. The tokens empower whoever holds them to vote on
what the organisation will do.
If we use familiar terms to describe the DAO, you could think of tokens as ‘company
equity’  and  token  holders  as                                                              ‘shareholders’.  While  not  entirely  accurate  in
conventional business terms, substituting those words when you read the rest of
this  article  may  be  useful.  What  the  company  actually  does  is  up  to  the  token
holders. New ideas are presented to the DAO in the form of proposals. Token holders
then vote on proposals and, if approved, contractors will be allowed to compete
for work on the resulting projects.”
With a basic understanding of what a DAO is and how it works, we can now get
into more details on how the Terawatt DAO will function. We will build a DAO, and
they will come . This is a decentralized autonomous organization that is essentially
a bank/pool of funding allocation for power companies, all businesses, and their
customers  (business  and  residential),  which  they  can  tap  to  ensure  that  these
L.E.D discounts can be offered/available 12 months out of the year instead of 3-6
months, or not at all in some cases. For businesses and everyday consumers, The
DAO  can  help  provide  them with  the  funding  needed  to  afford  upgrading  their
existing lights to LEDs. So, this project does not entirely rely on utility company
partnerships. Terawatt will act as both a funding bank, payment currency, and as an
immutable verifiable data ledger. Think of it like an insurance fund, or a merry-go-
round  of  appreciating  money,  that  allows  utility  companies,  businesses,  and  all
people worldwide  to  help  each  other  afford  LEDs.  This  helps  reduce  everyone's
electricity bills, helps the environment, increases light output, and further advances
the federal and state initiatives that are pushing for 100% LED adoption anyway.

We  may  use  a  percentage  of the  ICO  money  to  fund  the  DAO  initially.  We  are
actively pursuing partnerships with some of the largest utility companies, utility
commissions, and Lighting manufacturers  (such as GE and Philips) in the world,
and they are open to trying out this model . Terawatt will offer them a free-trial
basically, allowing the utility company to partake in the DAO and experience its
benefits firsthand. This removes the risk from the utility providers, and businesses,
and will help them realize the benefits of accepting the LED token as a payment
currency.
Terawatt DAO economics
Primary Participants of the DAO
1) Utility Companies 2) L.E.D. bulb sellers 3) All businesses, consumers, and token

Terawatt token will also be used as a payment currency. Utilities and busienss
will want to accept it because it’s much more deflationary, secure, and private
than FIAT(and even all other crypotocurrencies ). Also, the more tokens a utility

or business has. the more they can enter into the DAO fund, and that equals
more voting power, and more potential profits as well. This creates an upward

DAO Funding
Participants will add funds to the DAO in the form of Terawatt tokens (LED ticker).
All interested businesses and consumers, not just utility providers, can buy LED
tokens  and  participate  in  the  DAO.  This  will  help  increase  the  network  effect
(Metcalfe's  Law).  Now  we  have  a  growing  decentralized  fund  as  more  token
holders join.
Why invest in this DAO? High probability of making profits, to direct the funds via
voting on community proposals, and to help drive global L.E.D. adoption
The Terawatt token supply will rapidly and exponentially decrease with a continuous
coin burning algorithm. Terawatt will automatically use 50-75% of company profits
earned from DAO entry/exit fees, profit taking fees  (like an exchange), Carbon tax
data storage fees, carbon credits, and also from affiliate L.E.D. sales commissions
to buyback and burn (LED) Tokens. This is similar to the BNB token, but they only
burn every quarter. We will burn continuously.
This may or may not mathematically cause token value to greatly increase as we
are decreasing supply, while also increasing demand through marketing and growing
adoption. Ex: If a Utility company invests $10,000/month, in one year their account
value has possibly increased 200% from $120,000 to $360,000. They could withdraw
part, or all, of their account balance to provide subsidized LED’s to their customers
as  needed,  or  to  fund  other  green  initiatives,  like  solar,  wind,  energy  star-rated
materials. products, electric vehicles, etc. Businesses and token holders can use
their DAO  profits to  buy L.E.D.  bulbs which will reduce their utility bills,  qualify
them  for  government  tax  credits/rebates,  and  reduce  greenhouse  emissions.
We will also offer a token incentive or discount for participants who verify that they
used profits for buying/selling L.E.D.s or related technologies.
Moreover, it acts like a decentralized insurance fund, with the Terawatt token that
powers it also acting as a fast, private, secure monetary currency which can be
accepted at businesses and utility providers globally. It will make sense for utilities
and businesses to take payment in our tokens as it will allow them to add more
tokens into the DAO, and potentially greatly increase their profits. With the supply
being  extremely  more  deflationary  than  FIAT,  and  even  than  most  other
cryptocurrencies, it will become highly attractive as a payment currency.

DAO Technical Diagrams
1. Proposal
A Proposal can be submitted at anytime by any DAO Token
Holder. The proposal defines how much ether will be paid
to a Service Provider in exchange of the development of
products or service. It’s expected of a DAO to engage on
several proposals over time.

The DAO can charge anyone outside the                                                DAO token holder debate and then vote on

3. Development
If the proposal is accepted, work starts. The Service Provider is
bound by irrefutable smart contract code to deliver on a series
of objectives. Because the proposal is paid for an predefined
installments instead of a lamp sum, the Service Provider and
the DAO’s enjoy a mutualistic relationship.

Who can join the DAO?
All interested businesses and consumers, not just utility providers, can buy LED
tokens and participate in the DAO. This will help increase the network effect
(Metcalfe's Law) Now we have a growing decentralized fund as more and more
token holders join.
We also aim to do this for GAS, and SOLAR, and WIND, Electric Vehicles, Etcetera.
LEDs are just the beginning of the titan Terawatt will become. LEDs will be proof
of concept and then it will snowball from there into these other sectors. Once
utility companies experience the innumerable benefits of joining the DAO, they will
happily pay to join, and other companies that don’t do this will experience F.O.M.O
(fear of missing out).
Token Description
Our project will use Ethereum to issue and create
tokens  mainly  because  it  has  the  base  foundation
that  our  technology  will  implement.  Terawatt  will
manipulate  the  blockchain  smart  contracts.  Our
token  will  be  a  standard  ERC20  token  with  some
specific  modifications.  Our  algorithms  will  verify
that the consumer has actually purchased the bulbs
from a suitable seller and add the transaction to the
blockchain. Smart contracts will execute and manage
the entire process.
How LED Token will be implemented?
Our  token  will  use  POS  so  that  it  will  help  with
emissions  and  keep  the  environment  clean  and
green.  Our  first  implementation  will  be  on  the
Ethereum  Casper  Network  using  Proof  of  Stake.
This  network  is  able  to  finalize  blocks/messages
in  constant  time  O(1).  This  is  incontrast  to  the
O(N)  time  required  for  Byzantine  fault  tolerant
state  machine  replication.  Casper  uses  a  binary
consensus  protocol.  Protocol messages  has three
parts An Estimate(0 or 1), a sender( validator name)
and a justification. An Estimator then translates the
messages into 0’s and 1’s.

CBC Casper is a method for "deriving" consensus protocols . Using this method,
a family of protocols have been created that enjoy a variety of benefits over
traditional consensus protocols. These benefits include:
A (relatively) simple consensus safety proof!
No "in-protocol" finality threshold.
The ability to trade off latency to finality with number of validators,
rather than just network overhead.
Theoretically optimal network overhead in the certain cases.

Terawatt LED token is actually going to be part of a global distribution of how
consumers interact with energy not just about lighting. We are offering tokens to
consumers that use our patent-pending verification technology in order to verify
that  they  have  purchased  led  bulbs.  Product  tracking,  verification,  ecosystem
expansions are all in future works. We believe that being transparent and open
will help keep the sustainability and value of this token. We will also offer several
utilities such as:

DAO  - A decentralized fund for funding  sustainable  lighting  solutions worldwide.
A percentage of funds will be locked into a pool, and the global Terawatt community
will  vote/decide  on  what  projects  get  funded  and  how  much  funding  will  be
provided or set on the side for these projects.
Payment Currency - Terawatt will be accepted by utility companies and businesses
around the world
Incentives  - Terawatt Token will also act as a rewards system for each L.E.D.
bulb purchase that's verified by our patent-pending process. This serves as an
incentive for users to purchase LEDs for home, businesses, or government use
and verify them through our interface
Data Storage  -  LED  purchase  records,  and  all token  payment  records,  may be
securely stored in the Terawatt ecosystem. This allows the purchasing entity to
return at tax time and have all of their LED and other Energy Star Rated Purchase
records readily available. The user pays a small token fee to access the records
again.
Masternodes - When Ethereum makes it available. This will help to further secure
and decentralize the Terawatt ecosystem, while providing benefits like residuals
and staking/voting power to token holders

delationary as we have a continuous coin burning algorithm using 50-75% of DAO
profits to buyback and burn our own tokens daily 1 LED Token Represents 10,000
Watts (10 KW) of potential L.E.D. Electricity Usage As a verified LED bulb purchaser,
you may get LED Tokens for free.  3-5% of LED Tokens will be given to LED bulb
purchasers over the next 20 years
(c)2018, Terawatt Corp.

The  remaining  LED Tokens will be  used for developing  strong  partnerships with
government agencies and initiatives like the Department of Energy, Global Lighting
development,  LED  retailers  like  Amazon,  Philips,  and  General  Electric,  DAO
operations, marketing, legal, token participants, overhead, and to expand into other
rapidly growing renewable sectors like Solar, Wind, Electric Vehicles, Etcetera.
The end goal is to help cut  2,000 Terawatts of electricity usage worldwide  (~50%)
and  9 trillion tons of greenhouse emissions from electricity usage over the life of
the project. The beauty of LEDs is this will also increase light output by ~50 percent
as well. This will have a significant global impact on the environment, especially
in  countries  like  the  United  States,  China,  India,  The  EU,  etcetera.  Then  though
further  marketing,  education,  government/corporate/individual  partnerships,  and
strong development we will continue to drive global LED adoption initiatives.
ROI
Below  is  a  chart  showing  the  extreme  bullish  nature  of  the  BNB  token.  BNB
(Binance’s token) has a strong focus on monetization also, and they use some of
their profits from trading fees to  buy back and  burn their supply.  However, they
only burn once every quarter and with a goal of reducing supply  50% over a long
time, Terawatt will be burning everyday with a goal of reducing supply 99%! We will
also  be  marketing  aggressively  and  growing  our  user  base  while  simultaneously
reducing  supply,  just  IMAGINE  what  that  will  do  to  the  LED  token  price.  Still,
participants  should  do  their  own  research  and  acknowledge  that  we  cannot
guarantee any results. This example is only meant to show one of many possibilities:

Participant  funds  will  be  cold  stored  in  offline  multisig  wallets  requiring       3+
confirmations to withdraw ETH, further secured with MetaMask, and with offsite
keys/backups with detailed instructions left with a trusted entity in the event one
of  our  core  members  dies.  Participants  should  feel  extremely  safe  buying  our
tokens.
Our  smart  contracts  were  audited  by  Applicature’s  team,  and  we  will  audit  the
DAO vigorously, run bug bounties, and take exhaustive security measures to ensure
that our DAO will be “bulletproof.” As we build it we will look to add as many robust
security  features  as  possible,  these  may  include:  cold  storage  of  DAO  funds,
compartmentalize the DAO so if one section is compromised it will be contained,
an insurance fund, time delay on funding withdrawals, heavy encryption, and other
safeguards that we will discover as we  continue  building the  prototype  and final
product. Prototype is being built by the co-creator of the Ethereum DAO, Shubham
Tatvamasi. We can’t think of anyone better for this role than the person who helped
build the largest DAO ever constructed. Prototype is expected to be completed prior
to ICO in September. With a working product expected to be functioning shortly after,
which will put us way ahead of schedule. It would be built already, but we need
funds to finish it.

Token Utility
Why do we need blockchain?
To create an immutable, decentralized, secure, private (zk-SNARKS) deflationary
currency with utility functions
We need complex smart contracts to power the D.A.O.
We need Transparency, Immutability, Decentralization and verifications of all
transactions performed on the platform
Extremely precise process automation
It becomes convenient to work with other cryptocurrencies in an increasingly
digital world. Integration with other projects on blockchain (product tracking,
verification, ecosystem expansions, and so on)
Reliability and fault tolerance
The Terawatt token will have several utility functions:
Used as a secure, private (zk-SNARKS), fast, low cost, decentralized payment currency
at Utility Companies, LED Bulb Sellers, and any other interested merchants
Allows entry to the DAO, staking/voting abilities, powers the DAO ecosystem with
Ethereum Smart Contracts
Allows access to decentralized immutable renewable tax data records (for a small
fee), used as financial incentive to verify L.E.D. bulb purchases
Incentive                                                                               -  The  Terawatt  Token/Currency  acts  as  a  reward  for  each  L.E.D.
bulb/fixture purchase that's verified by our patent-pending process. This serves
as an incentive for users to purchase LEDs for home, businesses, or government
use and verify them through our interface
Data Storage  -  LED  purchase  records  may be  securely stored  in  the Terawatt

There are no companies doing this right now, and our project will have a token
ecosystem that can expand into many different renewable sectors like Wind, Solar,
Electric Vehicles, and more  . Terawatt i s patent-pending  (further patents to be
granted) and will use a community based governance model where participants
can vote with their tokens on which city/application we can help convert to LED’s.
Terawatt will also help to educate others about the benefits of switching to LEDs.
Monetization
We noticed that most (99 percent) crypto projects, coins, tokens, and ICO’s, have no
plan for monetizing their company, or its product/offering (except for accumulating
participant dollars). Very few solve a “real world” problem either, have token utility,
and even fewer further the global sustainability agenda that is progressing rapidly.
Also, almost none are patent-pending, proprietary in any way, or have the largest
contributor of the Ethereum DAO on their team. We wanted to tackle these pain
points head on, and deliver a superior blockchain based product and service. This
will  not  only  differentiate  this  project  and  make  it  very  attractive  to  financial
participants , but also will help change the world and provide a sustainable business
model going forward.
1. Fees from DAO usage, record storage, profit taking
Terawatt  will  earn  profits  from  DAO  entry/exit  fees,  profit  taking  fees  (like  an
exchange or mutual fund does),  Carbon tax data storage fees, time decay fees,
carbon credits, and also from affiliate L.E.D. sales commissions to buyback and
burn  (LED)  Tokens.  This  is  similar  to  the  BNB  token,  but  they  only  burn  every
quarter causing massive “pump and dumps” and we will burn tokens continuously.
2. Utilizing Local, State, Federal, and Global Tax Incentives, Carbon
Credits, and Rebates
“The  Federal  Government  provides  incentives  for  commercial  and  residential
entities to use energy efficient lighting measures. According to the Database of
State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency, the Federal Government will offer
any commercial entity                                                                           $0.30 to $1.80 per square foot of the building   , depending
on  the  technology  and  amount  of  energy  reduction,  to  allow the  company to
become more environmentally friendly.
(c)2018, Terawatt Corp.

The term “energy efficient lighting” includes the use of extremely energy efficient
LED light bulbs  .                                                                               Generally,  corporate  buildings  are  outfitted with  stronger,  and
therefore more expensive, light bulbs than residential buildings, and require more
of them. It can become rather expensive, so, as a result, the government provides
incentives for corporations to become more energy efficient. The Government also
provides a Tribal Energy Program Grant for tribal governments. The amount they
provide varies by solicitation. The Government will also possibly provide personal
exemptions for individuals looking to install energy efficient applications. If eligible,
the amount provided is  100% of the subsidy…. Almost every power company will
provide incentives , such as rebates , for people to take energy efficient measures
and to work towards a more sustainable environment. Check with your local power
or electric company to see what incentives they provide to encourage you to use
efficient LED light bulbs. You can also visit the website to see various incentives
provided in your area www.dsireusa.org
We  can  probably  gain  a  percentage  of  these  tax  incentives/rebates,  as  well  as
Carbon  Credits,  for  motivating  people/entities  to  switch  over,  and  this  will  be  a
huge revenue stream as we actively drive tons of traffic through our user interface
via aggressive marketing strategies. Think “Shapeshift” interface. They have a token
currency, but they also make millions with their website. If no rebates are available
for a specific  area or business, there will likely be  a tax write-off,  deduction,  or
credit available. Our software will scan for everything available to help drive LED
adoption globally. We are also developing a way to decentralize the rebate process
so that there is always an instant rebate available for the buyer. We are actively
contacting large energy companies like DUKE, Nextera, and PSE&G to find solutions.
3. Partnerships with L.E.D. manufacturers and Governments
It will be a no-brainer for a lighting manufacturer like General Electric, or Philips
for example, to partner with us as this business model inherently drives sales of
all L.E.D.  products.  Furthermore,  since  Governments  are  already pushing for this,
they will be quick to partner with us, lead by example, and switch over local, state,
and  federal  facilities  to  L.E.D.’s.  The  Department  Of  Energy  (DOE)  will  also  be  a
prime target for a partnership. Our COO is a Civil Engineer and will be focusing on
this  aspect  as well.  Our Advisor Jacob has  also helped build hundreds  of power
plants  in  emerging  nations.  Furthermore,  this  is  a  good  public  relations  move,
promoting a cleaner, more sustainable future through use of L.E.D. lighting solutions.
This is a cost saving measure that will help states drastically cut electricity costs
over time, leaving more money in budgets for other green initiatives.

4. Commissions from L.E.D. bulb sales
Once a participant signs up, we can give them the option to purchase the bulbs
through our websites affiliate links (Ie:, Home Depot, GE, Phillips, DUKE energy,
etc.). This will earn revenue for both this company, the L.E.D. manufacturer, and
also provides the buyer with convenience. We won't need to hold inventory or
deal with shipping, customer service, etcetera as it will just be an affiliate link.
(or we may go with drop shipping, or even installs and bulb recycling if it makes
sense down the road)
There are many other income opportunities that will present themselves. Imagine
when we  start  acquiring  big  government  or  corporate  contracts,  like  all of the
street  lights/lamps  in  Shanghai,  New  York  City,  or  Mumbai  for  example.  Or  if
companies like Walmart, or Costco, switch over to all LEDs and partner with us
to further their green energy initiatives and increase PR. From small companies to
large  ones,  one  bedroom  apartments,  to                                                80  story  hotels,  small  eco-friendly
nonprofits, to large global and governmental initiatives, the possibilities for growth
are endless.
5. Donations
We anticipate getting a lot of support for this project as the renewable energy and
sustainability initiatives continue their upward trends. We will accept donations to
the project in the form of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and potentially other crypto tokens
going forward. This is a “feel-good” project with a positive and altruistic mission,
and  everyone  can  contribute  to  helping  us  reduce  greenhouse  emissions  and
combat global warming. We have already received a lot of positive interest from
other blockchain projects. Going green is in! We aim to have a DAO (decentralised
autonomous organization) as part of our ecosystem that will contain a donated
LED token pool, and community users will vote on where they want to see the
tokens used to further certain initiatives. For example, option one could be to help
the city of Mumbai reach  100% LED adoption, but they need  1 million dollars to
reach that goal. The DAO will allocate the tokens to this project if the community
chooses  it  over  the  other  choices,  almost  like  a  kickstarter  platform  for
sustainability projects.
