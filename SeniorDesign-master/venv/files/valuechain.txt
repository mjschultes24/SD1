Abstract
This White Book describes that VALUE chain is a technology that applies blockchain technology
and CBT (Cross-Blockchain Transaction) protocol to actualize the seamless consumption
connection between online & offline shop and blockchain assets. It illustrates how to make
seamless connection between any real or virtual consumption place (online & offline shops) and
crypto currency, and reward each consumption by providing VLC tokens, which can also be
consumed on blockchain. As the first landed project connecting the blockchain to the real
consumer business, the VALUE chain uses infrastructure to interconnect and interoperate physical
and virtual platforms with the aim of creating a secure, stable, transparent and tamper-proof
product. We strive to provide maximum convenience to our users, empower them to use as much
blockchain assets as possible, and let them earn rewards for spending while complying with the
highest safety standards in the ecosystem.
VALUE chain does not belong to any party. Instead, it is an open and distributed network of
authentication nodes that will constrain the behavior of all participants. It uses a protocol tokens
mechanism to create shares certificate blockchain in order to achieve market activity among
participants. This high-performance distributed network allows transactions among various types of
assets—be it an issuer backed by legal currency, or a fully decentralized blockchain token (ERC-
20 and localized crypto digital currency). Any spend on the VALUE chain, regardless of which
tokens are being used, users would make a “mining” on VALUE chain through CBT protocol
conversion. Unlike almost any other decentralized transaction platform, the distributed network
allows for directly decentralized transactions between different blockchain without the need for
trusted gateway tokens. In addition, market spreads will drop significantly, and market protection
will be reinforced through decentralization regulation and increased transparency in market
activities. The above process ensures the correct pairing of entrusted transaction books by using
smart contracts and protocol tokens. This is a new structure that uses Ethereum guarantee
liquidation and Ethereum smart contract to protect historical transaction data.

1. Concept and current problem
The main function of blockchain is to solve the coordination issues of the multilateral protocols
among internet participants. By ensuring, guaranteeing and implementing the transparency, we
can effectively reach into multi-party consensus, which is impossible in old times. Internet
participants are more willing to engage in coordination when they finds that the business is
transparent, and the operation mechanism can not be changed easily. Obviously, participants can
be better guaranteed that no party can forcibly collect exorbitant profits or rental by changing
business processes or using information asymmetries. In other words, any single participant is
more than happy to use a system whose business processes and mechanisms are not owned by
any other individual participant.
There are basic coordination issues between online and offline merchants, gateways and
blockchain consumers. For example, consumers at supermarkets or shops want to use crypto
currency, while local legal currency can not provide benchmark to crypto currency immediately,
and the crypto currency network is sometimes delayed and congested. In the past, building a
payment system that was compatible between payment networks and agencies was a massive
undertaking. This process is usually done by establishing an exchange that manages the
transaction, that is, using the communication network of central clearing center or bank current
accounts, such as FedWire, CHIPS, SWIFT bank card payment network, NSCC / DTCC, OCC and
ACH. These networks serve in different roles and functions, including local / national payments,
international payments, credits, stock / asset delivery and derivatives. These centralized networks
allow control entities to change mechanisms at will, resulting in a substantial increase in
transaction costs in terms of information costs, due diligence and the execution of contracts
between all parties.
We think there is a vast rising market (such as Venmo, Alipay, etc.) of using new payment platform
to subvert digital payments. These networks are significant to cross-network transactions, as they
often need to undertake the indirect costs that are notable and mutually trusted between the
networks and transaction facilities. Contracting parties are reluctant to use central clearing center
or bank current accounts as neither side wants to be obedient to each other and the use of banking
accounts requires contracts between participants. While larger networks have enough incentive to
protect their own network, we believe most companies and institutions want to offer e-Wallet
services that require more coordination among multiple players. These medium-sized players will
be able to exchange cross-network value in order to have a sufficient impact on availability. These
infrastructures and reference frontends enable the network effects to be encoded into this network
so that new e-Wallet users can immediately create advanced network facilities. Blockchain allows
the society to transform the world's business processes from a single-center company into an open,
decentralized computing network. [1][2] VALUE (Value Chain) is a product that uses infrastructure
to interconnect and interoperate physical and virtual platforms and generate incentive products.

We strive to provide our users maximum convenience, and enable them to work in a completely
trusted, timely and cost-effective manner by connecting to blockchain and using the CBT protocol.
By transforming these business processes traditionally housed in a single company, we may be
able to provide a complete exchange method for the e-Wallet provider in a high-performance and
open network, which is the CBT protocol.
2. Transaction realization method
The final status of VALUE chain is an architecture with the decentralization mechanism for e-Wallet
platform that owns the value of the legal currency. As one of the core functions of this product is to
realize the transaction between the e-Wallets, VALUE chain must have a [3] [4] blockchain ledger
to maintain the overall fund balance for each e-Wallet service (or any user / node). This ledger
must be able to record funds across multiple types of assets / commodities. However, holding a
ledger is not enough for exchange. The mechanism must also allow these assets / commodities to
be traded.
In order to exchange, it needs to place a command between traders in the open public market.
This requires a decentralized transaction commission ledger and CBT protocol. This CBT protocol
is built in the VALUE blockchain. When a matching order is validated by most verification nodes,
the order will be released for further match. This process will be executed as part of each block,
which creates a unilateral non-regulated, decentralized transaction where such e-Wallet platform
can trade with other e-Wallet platforms without having to trust a centralized entity.
However, direct e-Wallet tokens exchange is not desirable, because it can be complicated. In the
absence of a single preference, we need to use crypto currency in the mobile market. By bundling
Ethereum with a smart contract [5] (or binding a Bitcoin-similar token to a clearing center), we can
create a mobile market based on Ethereum or other crypto currency e-Wallet (if each pair is
crossed with ETH, in the case of low currency fluctuations, the price difference will be much
smaller). For activities requiring very small price difference, it may happen that some e-Wallet
tokens will engage in cross use; however, due to the coordination and trust advantages associated
with procedural arbitration, it will be necessary for us to use decentralized tokens and, if necessary,
you can use other e-Wallet tokens. By allowing crypto digital currency to support the e-Wallet
platform, all e-Wallet trading activities are fair.
This means that locked-in funds require greater liquidity, and VALUE decentralized transactions
may be less desirable for low-value transaction activities (such as large amounts of
micropayments). Not each payment between two different e-Wallets has to be done using a
decentralized transaction. We can assume that the e-Wallet will reserve tokens of some other
e-Wallets for the microfinance in the popular direction. For example, architectures such as the
Lightning Network allow recording balance in e-Wallet to facilitate a chain payment on the premise
6




of quick payment. We allow payments across Bitcoin [7], Ethereum [8] and various other crypto
currencies, which can easily be ported to the VALUE chain through the CBT protocol to record
e-Wallet balances.
2.1 Lightning Network and decentralized liquidity pool
With the help of decentralized transactions and crypto digital currencies (such as BTC, ETH, EOS,
etc.) matching, the VALUE blockchain architecture allows online or offline transactions between
any e-Wallet.
An additional benefit of this architecture is that it allows a decentralized liquidity pool to be used for
various cryptographic currency payment channels. For separate token payment on the blockchain,
it is necessary for us to extend the underlying blockchain activities without affecting the underlying
chain, so as to reduce the computational burden on the verification / mining nodes. Therefore,
using a Lightning Network is a must (or a similar architecture to lightning network channel).
However, the Lightning Network faces tremendous pressure on the network effects of capital, so
we want to avoid centralizing liquidity pools in the hands of a single trusted entity. By using the
same mechanism as decentralized clearing center, we can create a lightning network hub that
does not belong to any single entity and supports more sophisticated smart contracts (eg.
Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens, etc.). For currencies with simple smart contracts, any node in the
network, such as a Bitcoin network, can act as a gateway to the VALUE chain pool, and cross with
any other participants. This will significantly reduce many of the online activities of the VALUE
chain, while encouraging decentralization.
In conjunction with the CBT protocol, we believe that we can use certainty / known consistency
rules to practice the method of decentralized interest chains in mitigating the natural network
effects of liquidity concentration.
Especially for Ethereum (and other blockchain with full-featured smart contract scripts), all
participants can set the channel as an ETH smart contract that exercises the function of single pool
of funds. The chain status of VALUE chain reflects the current balance of the participants. This will
allow any participants to provide liquidity on this network, which can be allocated according to the
VALUE chain consensus rules (if this structure has been successful before robust testing /
validation, then we will add some restrictions at early stage to prevent the blockchain from
absorbing all remaining liquidity from crypto currency). Therefore, these funds can be used for any
liquidity activity on the VALUE chain and for consumer mining incentives on the VALUE chain.

3. VALUE wallet and credit card payment
The VALUE wallet is the core product that connects the VALUE chain, digital assets, CBT
protocols, users and merchants, enabling consumers to spend instantly on their blockchain assets
through their smart phones or debit cards. In the future, there will be access to more than 36
million global online and offline retail outlets. The VALUE wallet app is free to download on IOS
and Android systems (it will come online in early or middle 2018). VALUE wallet has the following
advantages:
• access to 38 million online and offline retail outlets in more than 180 countries around the
world
• most reliable conversion rates and transaction fees (at no additional cost)
• decentralized wallet, trustworthy wallet app
• support for multiple digital currencies (any blockchain asset)
• support for multiple national currencies
• For each consumption, the user would make a mining at the VALUE chain and the result will
be a VLC token transferred to the user, who can enjoy the added value bonuses arising from
tokens increase (see the Tokens Sales section for more information)

3.1 VALUE wallet and credit card
Once the user downloads the app, it can set up the account by phone number or email account.
A wallet that supports multiple digital currencies is then automatically created, hence users can
consume in different digital currencies. Private keys are completely secure with industry-standard
cold and hot storage solutions. In mid-2018, we will connect smart wallets directly to CBT where
users can store their own private keys.
Until the last confirmed online / offline consumption, digital currency does not need to be converted
into legal currency, and this conversion happens in real time. Users can choose different
blockchain assets to make the payment. Furthermore, by using our smart wallet, users have the
flexibility to convert blockchain assets such as Bitcoin, ETHERNET, EOS, HSR, and many other
digital currencies.
Users can directly select virtual or real debit cards through our app. For safety, we offer the user
two options: to lock or not to lock the card. This makes our product safer than traditional credit or
debit card.
3.2 CBT integrated payment
Payment procedure:
VALUE cardholders are able to buy products and services using any blockchain asset at more than
38 million retail outlets. We use the CBT payment channel to allow users to make payment
requests from credit cards. Here's how to make real-time payments from your wallet to your credit
card:
1. The user can use virtual or real VALUE debit card at online / offline shops
2. The credit card system will automatically send a request to our server
3. VALUE will send the payment request to the user via CBT network
4. The user can choose which blockchain assets to pay, and then send the appropriate
amount to the VALUE system through VALUE wallet app
5. VALUE will approve the transaction and transfer it to the retailer upon the receipt of
payment request

4. Interpretation to CBT protocol
Prior to the invention of the TCP / IP protocol, the Internet was dispersed across many local
networks, namely the so-called local area networks. These improve the efficiency of traditional
point-to-point communications (such as letters, faxes, telephones). The real breakthrough was in
1973, when the different LANs realized they could communicate with each other using a unified
Internet protocol and the Internet was born.

The basic structure of the Internet and CBT is exactly the same, and their purposes are similar:
value exchange. In today’s world, value exchange is very similar to the information exchange
before the existence of Internet, that is, a point-to-point exchange in a closed system.
The full name of the CBT protocol is Cross-Blockchain Transaction. It is a protocol based on the
VALUE chain that aims to convert any asset on the block.
VALUE-chain-based CBT protocol runs this core protocol with four features:
•                                                                                                  Dual consumer protection
•                                                                                                  Multi-signature
•                                                                                                  Time lock
•                                                                                                  Uniform hash function
Below we will respectively elaborate on these features of the CBT protocol.
11




Double consumer protection:
Dual consumption protection is the primary significance of the blockchain. In technical jargon, this
means that two valid transactions that consume the same transaction output (UTXO) will have
conflicts, and only one will be confirmed on the network. Account-based languages (such as
Ethereum) allow the same amount to be consumed multiple times from the same address, and
there are often other ways to prevent dual consumption.
Multiple signatures:
Multi-signature is a very old concept, which allows a comparison among multiple payment ledgers
that need to be shared by signers. Multi-signature allows the enforcement of any rules that require
joint-signature. CBT adopts two multi-signatures, both of the signers must sign the transaction to
as to be accepted by the network. Multi-signature transaction is a must for VALUE chain payment
channel.
Time lock:
Time lock is the simple need to lock in funds to a future date. Blockchain possesses two different
types of time locks: relative and absolute time locks. The absolute time lock will lock the
transaction output until a specific time in the future. The relative time lock will lock the transaction
output related to the time the transaction was confirmed. CBT uses relative time locks because
they allows for the opening of payment channels indefinitely.
Uniform hash function:
To be able to cross multiple blocks, we need to use the same hash function, provided by the smart
signing language for each blockchain. Standard hash functions like the SHA256 hash function are
usually available and perfectly suited for this purpose.
5. VLC (Value Currency) tokens and consumption
mining mechanism
To make the ecosystem of VALUE work more perfectly, the VALUE team issues VLC tokens to
reward all consumers who contribute to the VALUE ecosystem. VLC token is the code name of
tokens on VALUE chain, and VLC tokens are created based on Ethereum smart contracts.
Ethereum is an open-source, publicly-maintained distributed underlying computer system based on
blockchain technology that provides decentralized turing-complete virtual machines to support the
operation of smart contracts. As the most mature platform for smart contracts in the market,
Ethereum has very active community and its foundation runs well. Therefore, VALUE founding
team decided to adopt Ethereum to build cross-chain consumption and multi-asset swap
consumption on blockchain application, so that we can focus more on business development and
ecological promotion, and avoid excessive investment in the early stage to develop the underlying
blockchain technology.
12




We implemented a number of characteristics based on Ethereum to support the operation of VLC,
including “standardized asset registration” via smart contracts.
5.1 Token Contract Standard
ERC20 Token Standard is the account contract standard acknowledged by Ethereum community.
Bancor protocol, Status, Tenx, BAT, ugChain and other well-known token contracts applied to
Ethereum comply with the standard, part of applications can be found at https://etherscan.io/tokens,
and the token contracts complying with the standard can be searched at https://etherscan.io/token-
search
With a large number of well-known applications based on ERC20 constructing token contracts,
VLC uses ERC20 to avoid potential risks on contractual layer.
5.2 Standardized asset registration
The VALUE team will register any asset consumed on the VALUE chain with VLC in a unified way
across the blockchain to ensure that all data is made public, transparent and not tampered with
once the asset is validated through the smart contract. Therefore, the data used for VLC sharing
assets is completely reliable, without the appearance of false assets or transactions.
5.3 VLC Consumption mining algorithm: PoV Mining difficulty
algorithm
As a completely new algorithm, the PoV(Proof of Value) Consensus algorithm originated by
VALUE team motivates users' contributions to consumption. Mining difficulty is the measured value
of consumption contribution with the output of per VLC. When digging out more tokens, the greater
the degree of difficulty, the higher the market value of the output VLC, that is to say, mining
difficulty will change as the difficulty coefficient of total output changes. Under the PoV consensus
mechanism, the following algorithm is applicable to the consumption mining difficulty:
Benchmark                                                                                               Difficulty

Percentage of
excavated
Among which, the benchmark degree of difficulty = 10 blocks; update cycle: once every 30 minutes.
Assuming that the total consumption amount on the VALUE chain is V, the PoV consumption
mining income is:

Mining difficulty
Therefore, the more you spend on the VALUE chain, the greater the income will be.
5.4 Comparison between consumption mining PoV and bitcoin
mining PoW
The three basic elements of a blockchain network include computing, storage and network. The
PoW algorithm is an economic incentive to calculate the contribution of users. PoV is the economic
incentive for consumers to spend on the VALUE network, contributing to maintaining the long-term
safety, stable and reliable operation of VALUE. It will play an irreplaceable role in the healthy
development of VALUE ecology.

8. Conclusion
With the popularity of e-wallet platform, island network is becoming a problem. This situation
creates a unique opportunity for legal tokens to actualize decentralization web transactions and
increase the cross compatibility of crypto digital currency. In order to establish such
decentralization transaction network, it needs not only a blockchain that fits well with the issued
tokens to be paid and traded, but also a decentralization transaction center that supports these
activities, as well as an incentive to develop an efficient flow pool. Eventually, these issued tokens
may be getting closer and closer to being totally decentralized (including the keys owned by the
user), maximizing the agent right of individual. We can do this by creating transparency in business
processes of payment transaction, and by removing ownership of the business process from a
single trusted person. VALUE hopes that in the future, every single consuption will be able to
generate greater value.
