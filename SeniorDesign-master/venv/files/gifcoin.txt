SUMMARY




GIFcoin Whitepaper
Summary
Summary
This White Paper is the single legal document presented to the
public in connection with the Initial Coin Offering of GIFcoin.
The GIF in GIFcoin stands for Gambling Investment Fund. This fund
is backed by an already functioning betting website -
VitalBet.com.
Our aim is not to convince you that we are crafting something
genius, like many ICOs declare. In fact, unlike the majority of other
ICO campaigns, we already have a real working project.
The idea of GIFcoin Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is to raise capital,
which we'll use to upgrade VitalBet's gambling platform, as well
as popularize and promote the VitalBet Brand on the most
promising betting markets (countries). After we have completed
all these steps, we expect a large increase in VitalBet's clients. As
a result, we will share 80% of VitalBet's net profits with our GIFcoin
token holders on a yearly basis. As simple as that.
Buying GIF Tokens from our ICO will enable Investors to
participate in an existing and moneymaking business that is at
the beginning of a long-term, sustainable growth.

OUR STORY




GIFcoin Whitepaper
Our Story
Our Story
It all started back in 2011 when we formed a small team,
consisting of a web designer, an SEO master, a PPC expert, and a
programmer. Instead of creating a studio for web design and
marketing, we decided to begin with our own projects related to
affiliate marketing.
Starting with an Amazon affiliate, we went through pills affiliate
programs, software affiliates, as well as other affiliate programs,
but we were not satisfied with the results.
After a profound analysis of the affiliate market, we found out that
the most profitable affiliate programs are the ones for betting
and gambling.
For that reason, we decided to create betting and casino
catalogs in which to present bookmakers and gambling websites.
We started in our own country - Bulgaria - with several betting
and casino catalogs. By the end of the third month, we had
already surpassed the revenue we had from the already
established Amazon affiliate websites. This made us realize that
we need to focus all our efforts and capital into the betting niche.
Six months afterward, we decided to enter the U.K. market -
again with betting affiliate catalogs. Month after month, we
increased not only the number of catalogs but also the number
of countries, which we entered, as well as expanded our business
and profits.

Our Story
Our Story
In 2014, we were already very satisfied with what we had achieved
- both in terms of profits and knowledge. One evening, we had a
team meeting where we started analyzing how much money
bookmakers make. On the basis of what we had been earning as
betting affiliate marketers, we came to the conclusion that being
an owner of a bookie was something very profitable and
powerful.
We decided to do further research on how much capital we shall
need to create our own betting site, how much operating money
we need for paying players' profits, etc.
After deep research and analysis of the market competition
among betting websites, by the end of 2014, we had enlisted the
top companies which create fully-functioning platforms for
betting websites, with all the necessary extras and functionalities.
We sent inquiries, compared the offers, and chose the best offer
not only in terms of price but also in terms of customer support.
The help of the company we chose was amazing. They explained
to us how much operating money we need, what are the best
channels for marketing and advertising, as well as how to
gradually improve the attractiveness of a bookmaker's affiliate
program. They told us where to get licenses from. They also
provided us with invaluable advice and today, they are still
helping us.

Our Story
Our Story
The first month of our betting website - VitalBet.com - was quite
challenging. We didn't have a lot of clients despite that we had
put banners on our betting catalogs at key positions. However,
after a short research, we realized our mistakes and thanks to the
company which created our betting site, we built the appropriate
strategy for advertising, branding, and targeting. Things started to
happen in the next few months, and they were happening quite
fast. At the beginning of the fourth month, we had already
gathered over 5,000 active users-clients, which motivated us very
much, especially after the first month of disappointment.
In the beginning of 2017, we started to notice the large expansion
of cryptocurrencies so we decided to add Bitcoin to our site. Since
then, our players can use the most popular cryptocurrency not
only as a payment method (deposit & withdrawal) but also to
bet with it. This Bitcoin implementation further motivated our chief
programmer to start researching and studying Blockchain
technology and dig deeper into the world of cryptocurrencies.
In the middle of 2017, he shared with our team that thanks to the
cryptocurrency Ethereum and their Smart Contracts, we can
create an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) with which to collect capital
to further improve and upgrade our brand VitalBet. The capital
which we gather will be used for aggressive marketing and
advertising campaigns to increase the user base, which will lead
to an increase in profits.

After a profound research and analysis of the ICO market, in
November 2017, we decided to release an ICO and share our idea
with you. With your support and trust, and with our knowledge
and know-how, we believe we can achieve our aim to enter the
TOP 15 bookmakers worldwide, which will bring gigantic profits to
both you and us. According to our research and analysis, each of
the TOP 15 bookmakers in the world generates a yearly revenue
of $800+ million…
Now Is The Time To Act.

VITALBET - Betting Site Overview

simple, safe, and accessible activity for every user.
VitalBet is a fully-operational, online betting website. Following
significant efforts, invested in marketing research, programming,

mid-2015, covering all major sports for online betting, as well as
casino, eSports, and virtual sports.

Benefits
What makes us really stand out from the grand majority of other
bookies is the fact that we offer cryptocurrency payments with
Bitcoin - both for betting and payments (deposits and
withdrawals).
ONLY a few out of the TOP 100 bookmakers provide this option at
the moment. Additionally, thanks to the funding through the ICO,
we will add all major cryptocurrencies as betting options and
payment methods, which will make us really stand out in the
online betting industry.
In addition, besides digital currency payments and betting
options, you will also get extras, such as:
Ÿ  Sports Events Wagers
Ÿ  IN-Play Bets
Ÿ  Casino
Ÿ  Live Casino
Ÿ   eSports
Ÿ   Virtual sports
Ÿ  Livestreaming (coming soon)

Usage
We covered all popular fiat payment methods in the industry
(Debit/Credit Cards - VISA and MasterCard - and E-wallets -
Skrill, Sofort, Paysafecard, etc.), and we also added the most
popular cryptocurrency - Bitcoin.
Our plan is to attract more bettors by allowing them to use major
cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple
(XRP), Dash (DASH), and more.
By doing so, we will not only broaden our client reach but also
contribute to developing cryptocurrencies as an instrument for
payments and betting. As expected, this new feature will use
Blockchain technology to guarantee maximum security for every
user, and make the gambling experience even more exciting.
Simplicity
Very often, betting websites have a complicated design, which
burdens users. Our plan is to make the most attractive,
minimalistic design ever created. On our innovative platform, the
user will see and use only the functions which really contribute to
enjoyable betting.

Future Betting Market Expansion
Our team performed a very comprehensive marketing research.
As a result, it outlined 15 of the most promising markets for online
betting to enter.

amount of money raised during the ICO, investments into each
country of expansion will take place successively, from 2017 to

Market Overview
The Gambling and Sports Betting Market
These high revenue shares are due to the superior bets in the
market in comparison with the wagers placed via lotteries and in
casinos, as well as owing to the increasing authorization and
legalization of sports betting online, allowing users to place bets
from any corner of the globe.
With an ever-expanding internet-using population and a growing
legalization of online sports betting in numerous countries,
counting the U.S.A., this market segment will experience a
substantial growth in the upcoming years.

Market Overview
The Gambling and Sports Betting Market
The following features typically characterize the global online
sports betting market:
Large market  size and top phase of growth.
Seasonality of most sports - high season during world sports
events (FIFA World Cup, for instance) or low season during the
summer.
Big initial   costs for entering new markets, mainly owing
to expensive licensing and costly promotion campaigns.
The large market share is attributed to a limited number of sports,
such as soccer, horse racing, basketball, cricket, and greyhound
racing.
Illegal nature of sports betting in a number of Asian countries,
including the enormous markets of China, India, Hong Kong, and
South Korea; the entire market of sports betting is $1.5+ trillion, out
of which legal betting (check the figure above) represents less
than 20% of the total revenue.

Market Overview
Competition
We acknowledge the extremely high level of competition in online
gambling, as well as the presence of many powerful,
multinational bookmakers.
Currently, VitalBet is in the TOP 100 bookies (71st place),
according to Alexa betting sites traffic ranking.
However, we believe that thanks to capital raised from the ICO,
we will be able to enter the TOP 15 bookmakers in the world by
2020.
We will overtake our competitors by providing the world's most
efficient platform for online betting, in addition to the other
cutting-edge advantages discussed in our Roadmap below.

ROADMAP




GIFcoin Whitepaper
Roadmap
The 11 Steps to Our Mutual Success
After the ICO has successfully ended, our Legal Department
1
will create a new joint-stock company to guarantee your
rights to shares from the new company. VitalBet will be part of
this new company.
After the success of the ICO campaign, we will be able to         2
expand the Team with New, Highly-skilled Professionals, which
will help us for the quick growth and development of the
project.
We'll immediately start working on the New Design of the          3
website, which will help us to better entertain the current and
new customers with the best user-friendly experience.
After we finish and release the new design, we will create the    4
smartest and most innovative Mobile App in the betting
industry, which will help us to engage with many new users.
5                                                                 Entire new update of the Affiliate Program - with the most
                                                                  attractive promotions and commissions in the betting
industry.
We will add all popular Cryptocurrencies as Betting Options       6
and Payment Methods (deposits and withdrawals), which will
make us stand out from the competition in the gambling
niche.
Page 25




GIFcoin Whitepaper
Roadmap
The 11 Steps of Our Mutual Success
After we successfully enhance and upgrade our betting                7
platform, it will be time to further popularize and establish the
Brand VitalBet, using the most sophisticated marketing
campaign techniques.
Parallel to the marketing campaign, we will start an Advertising     8
Campaign in strictly targeted channels used ONLY for the
promotion of betting platforms and gambling companies.
We will apply for Licenses in the most attractive countries, which   9
have strict requirements and regulations, so that we can freely
and legally operate on their already developed markets.
After accomplishing all previous goals, we will release another      10
major update - VitalBet v.2.0 - with many new extras and
functionalities, which will make the website one of the most
appealing to gamblers worldwide.
When we start the initial waves of the marketing and advertising     11
campaigns, we expect the users to grow exponentially at a very
rapid pace. Our expectations are to reach 100% user growth in
the first month, and 500% in the first six months.

Initial Coin Offering (ICO) - GIFCOIN
Initial Coin Offering (ICO) - GIFCOIN
To grow quickly and outpace the competition, VitalBet needs
initial capital for new design and functionality, launching of a
mobile app, country market expansion, as well as marketing and
advertising campaigns.
Collecting capital through the two traditional financing methods -
debt and equity - seem to be expensive, time-consuming, or
extremely risky.
By using an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as an alternative
instrument for financing, we intend to gather funds in a faster and
in a much less risky way. The raised funds will serve exclusively for
the realization of our plans (see the Roadmap section above).
To reward our ICO Investors, we are going to share 80% of
VitalBet's annual net profits with them once a year.

Profit Share Distribution
The profit share distribution process includes two stages:
1) Getting the exact data about the GIF tokens distribution
among users (Profit Share Report).
2) Sharing the Company's profit among the token holders in
the end of every year.
Profit Share Report
To have a proof of GIF ownership by exact addresses, GIFcoin will
take a snapshot of the Blockchain before each profit share
distribution. It permits to use the current state of tokens
distribution among ICO Investors as on the exact block. The
quantity of the milestone block, as well as an estimated date and
time of its appearance, will be announced in advance both at
GIFcoin's website and by email.

VITALBET - Expected Future Profits by 2020
Our aim by 2020 is to enter the ranks of the TOP 15 world betting
sites,   which   use   FIAT   currencies,   and   the   TOP             3   world
cryptocurrency betting sites.
From the 300,000,000 users who will practice betting, using fiat
money, in 2020, our target will be 0,6%, which is 1,800,000.
From  the                                                               5,000,000  users  who  will  practice  betting,  using
cryptocurrencies, in 2020, our target will be 10 %, which is 500,000.
The grand total will be 2,300,000 users.
According to unofficial data, 90% of gamblers lose their bets.
We  aim  at  gathering  2,300,000  players  by  2020.  Out  of  them,
around 2,100,000 will be active annually.
                                                                        From our experience, each of them loses around $360 per year, or
approximately                                                           $30  per  month.                                                   2,100,000  players  x   $360  lost

The net profits of 45% amount to $340,200,000. Out of these
$340,200,000, we will share 80%, which is $272,160,000.
These $272,160,000 will be distributed annually between the
300,000,000 tokens as a profit share. In this way, every owner of 1
GIFCOIN token will receive an annual profit share, amounting to
$0.9072.
Let’s say Joshua has 10,000 GIFCOIN tokens. He will have an
annual profit share of $9,072 which will be paid in ETH in his
Ethereum wallet once a year.
