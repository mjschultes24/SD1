Problems of current market
Problems of current traditional centralised banking system and its fiat currencies:
Government intervention - Banks have a  disturbing amount
of command over people’s personal data and fiat currencies
which ultimately troubles people
Centralised Banking - When bank confiscates the account
of a  person for any reason, the procedures and process takes
a  lot of time.
Under-resourced economy  - The inefficient and ineffecti-
ve distribution of resources between people and economy
is a  current problem
Financial  Exclusion                                                                  -  According  to  a    report  published
in 2018, it shows that there are more than 2 billion people
of the adult community in the world who are either not
accessing any the facilities by traditional banking system
or are able to access only partial facilities.
Unsatisfactory systems and unfair practices - The current
banking systems are not created to support local or global
micro-economy, nor do they encourage financial inclusion
Restricted  numbers  of  clients  -  The  number  of  clients
is limited by country and system barriers.
Speed of Transaction - It takes several days and depends on
the bank to bank relations
Scalability - It is expensive and slow
Transfer Values - The transfer values are limited and restric-
ted by law and order
International Transfers - It is restricted, slow and expensive.
