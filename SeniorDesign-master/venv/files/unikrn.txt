UnikoinGold: A Decentralized Esports Gaming Token                                                                                           3
Abstract
Unikrn operates a leading international esports entertainment and betting Platform. Currently, users of the Platform use our existing
Unikoin token to participate on the Platform, and to buy products such as jackpot tickets. But now, with the emergence of blockchain
technology, Unikrn can make it easier and more efficient for its users to obtain esports products and services on the Platform by
introducing a blockchain-based token: UnikoinGold.
UnikoinGold is designed as a decentralized ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Its use within the Platform will have certain
limitations depending on whether users are located in jurisdictions in which Unikrn is licensed to offer a full suite of betting services
(Full Service Jurisdictions) or in jurisdictions where Unikrn will offer a more limited set of betting services (Limited Jurisdictions).
In Full Service Jurisdictions, we intend for UnikoinGold to be used for the exchange and interchange of a virtual point-based reward
system for the purpose of legal and licensed betting on esports matches, tournaments and other engagement around gaming,
including jackpots. As designed, UnikoinGold would also be used as a rewards and incentive token for esports participants, players and
teams through tipping. It would also be an entry to a new version of the existing Unikrn spectator betting platform, and it is intended
to become the token used on a new skill-based betting platform. Our goal is for UnikoinGold to power the most immersive live-betting
platform for esports.
In Limited Jurisdictions, UnikoinGold can still be used to purchase jackpot tickets involving esports and for accessing exclusive rooms.
It won’t, however, be usable for gaming-related uses that require licenses.
In parallel to UnikoinGold we will launch UnikoinSilver to take the place of the former “Unikoin” within our ecosystem. UnkoinSilver,
like the former Unikoin, can’t be withdrawn from the Platform. Users will be able to earn, bet and compete using UnikoinSilver in any
jurisdiction where we offer the Platform.
Our intention: UnikoinGold will serve as a utility token creating a decentralized, community-driven virtual economy. Transactions will be
executed by a system of Ethereum smart contracts that are publicly accessible and that will be open and transparent to the network.

UnikoinGold: A Decentralized Esports Gaming Token                                                                                           4
The Unikrn Model: Esports
Wagering on the Blockchain
Advantages of the Blockchain
The current Unikrn model provides users the ability to liquidate their
Unikoins through the Unikrn jackpot market. However, betting laws limit
Unikoin functionality to exist solely within the Unikrn system. The proposed
ERC20 token, UnikoinGold, will give alternative methods of possibly
turning over their winnings on the Unikrn platform. An ERC20 token on the
Ethereum blockchain offers additional functionality that is seldom found
on a centralized token ecosystem.
Unikrn sees a lot of potential in converting our Unikoin into an Ethereum-
based utility token. About two years ago we created the Unikoin to allow
global participants to watch all the top esports matches in the world
and place bets using our world class betting platform. One of the bigger
requests we’ve had from our users is adding more value to the Unikoin, on
top of the jackpots platform we already offer.
We will be launching two completely new platforms on top of our existing
Unikrn IO betting platform. Unikrn anticipates to expand beyond Australia and the UK for UnikoinGold betting, and we also plan to allow
more betting operators to license our entire platform which includes risk management. This will ultimately allow customers in more
regions around the world to live bet on tournaments, and also bet on themselves in skill-based challenges.
While Unikoins have been successful in engaging and retaining customers, upgrading this virtual currency to an Ethereum-based utility
token will dramatically increase usage and utility. The creation of UnikoinGold coincides with a skill-based betting product that will be
legal in most of the US and other markets in the world. We will still offer fiat betting where we are regulated and licensed, and our new
UnikoinGold platform will be another option for those users.
We aim for UnikoinGold to become a standard token for the esports and gaming ecosystem, an ecosystem backed by Unikrn - a
company that holds integrity and complying with legislation in high regard.

Token Functionality Globally
Products and Services on the Platform
Unikrn intends to make a variety of products and services available on the Platform, these can be currently grouped into three general
categories: gambling, jackpots, and premium features.
Unikrn’s envisioned gambling products include skill-based wagering and spectator-based gambling. Unikrn’s esportsbook offers one
of the widest selections of gambling markets on professional esports matches and tournaments in the world. We are also testing skill-
betting products which we currently expect to release later this year.
Unikrn’s jackpot products offer users the opportunity to acquire jackpot tickets to win prizes (ranging from in-game items such as skins,
to gaming hardware and accessories from world-class manufacturers). We are also developing exclusive jackpot rooms (“exclusive
rooms”) with experiences only available to users who purchase golden entry tickets with UnikoinGold.
Finally, our premium membership roadmap includes the ability for users to earn UnikoinGold and UnikoinSilver for playing and winning
video games on our community servers.  We also intend to create user wallets on our platform for premium members to transact
quicker without additional transaction fees. Unikrn also has intentions to allow users to tip esports professionals using UnikoinSilver
and UnikoinGold.
Unikrn anticipates making more features available over time. Unikrn will start to release some of these new features between 90-180
days after the token sale. Features may be limited based on the type of jurisdiction.
The UnikoinGold token will be an essential part of Unikrn’s crypto platform. The main utilities that we are working to make available to
UnikoinGold token holders can be found below, this list is subject to change:

Betting applications
Chance-based applications
To be available in Full Service Jurisdictions
Parimutuel betting
When development is completed, a user who is interested in betting on a match will be able to place a bet that triggers contract
creation enabling them to do so within one transaction. Users with a registered address can generate a transaction to bet on
an outcome or use the internal Unikrn address to place a bet more seamlessly in the contract. This contract creation is visible
to Unikrn’s backend systems through ethereum logs which will enable us to keep track of the contracts that need results. On
match start, the Unikrn crypto platform will close the contract from accepting any additional bets (current blocktime is ~20
seconds). The costs associated with closing betting and posting the final results will be subtracted from the pool as well as the
% operating fee. A minimum bet limit will be enforced via smart contracts to avoid issues with paying out dust. When a match
is finished Unikrn will post results to all interested contracts which will enable a payout. This enables us to be more transparent
with our odds and payouts since one contract will be for multiple users.
Other anticipated chance-based products include esportsbook, jackpots, bingo, and jackpot.
Skill-based applications
To be available in Limited & Full Service Jurisdictions
Unikrn’s crypto platform will enable players to interact with UnikoinGold smart contracts. The UnikoinGold token will be able to
be used as a wager in competitive skill-based video game matches or tournaments. Users can send their tokens to a smart
contract that acts like a decentralized escrow. The smart contract will facilitate the reward settlement to the winner(s) after the
match is verified by Unikrn’s result verification system.
Peer-to-peer
This type of wagering requires two players to take opposite sides of a Unikoin smart contract. Both players must agree on the
amount at stake. A player can initiate a skill-based match for UnikoinGold by funding it on the Unikrn crypto platform from their
internal wallet. After the opposing player sends their tokens for the other side of the bet, the Unikrn crypto platform will mark
it as a verified match with reward settlement based on the outcome of an in-game event (e.g. winning a match). Once the in-
game event(s) conditions are met, the Unikrn crypto platform will record the results on the platform and the blockchain, which
will enable a payout to the player that wins. If the in-game event conditions are never met, the tokens will be returned to each of
the player’s respective wallets.
Winner-Takes-All
Wagering on winner-takes-all skill-based matches is similar to peer to peer wagering except multiple players can bet against
others in one match. This mode of wagering can enable players to risk a smaller amount compared to the overall pot.
Tournaments
Tournament hosted on Unikrn’s crypto platform will be like other skill-based types, the main difference being that the reward
settlement for the winning player or team will be based on a smart contract that is tied to a tournament bracket on the platform
instead of in-game events. Tournaments will have an entry fee in UnikoinGold or UnikoinGold to enter. Users will also have
the ability to win access to the rooms via jackpots or as rewards in gamifications quest completion. A user can sign up for
a tournament at any time until its completion. At the end of the tournament, users will be ranked, with top winners rewarded
guaranteed prizes, such as more Unikoins, skins and gaming gear. Lower-ranked players will be automatically entered in
jackpots to win smaller prizes, such as Unikoins or free entry to future tournament or jackpot rooms.

control and may ultimately prove unsuccessful. Unikrn may discontinue features if they are not profitable, gambling regulations or
licensing requirements change, or for other reasons.

Platform. The value may be affected by market conditions and other factors, including changes in the regulation of esports gaming
and gambling. Such changes may adversely effect on the utility and value of the tokens.
•                                                                                                                                    Unless other esports platforms adopt UnikoinGold, UnikoinGold will not have any utility during any period in which circumstances

by allowing participants to to earn UnikoinGold through activity on the Platform and by selling UnikoinGold from the reserve.
•                                                                                                                                    The ability to convert UnikoinGold into other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies will depend on the development of a trading market
for the token. Unikrn has no obligation to promote or support trading of UnikoinGold.
