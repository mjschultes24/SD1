WARNING ON ICO RISKS
By subscribing to the ICO, the subscriber acknowledges being fully informed of the warning contained in the
document entitled «PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON INITIAL COIN OFFERINGS (ICOs)1 issued by the “Autorité des
Marchés Financiers” (AMF) and in particular:
Risk of capital loss:
Capital invested in the ICO is not guaranteed. The investment made by the subscriber presents a significant
risk of capital loss.
No regulation of ICOs:
The White Paper provided by SGAT TECHNOLOGIES in support of the ICO is for information purpose and can’t
under any circumstances be assimilated to a legal or regulatory information document subject to prior control
by the AMF.
Lack of guarantees:
The subscriber does not benefit from any of the legal guarantees associated with IPOs on regulated financial
markets or other financial investments regulated by the AMF, as ICO does not benefit from a dedicated legal
framework and is essentially covered by these contractual provisions.
Volatility risk of tokens:
“The value of tokens, just like that of cryptocurrencies in general, can be extremely volatile and subject to
significant, and largely unforeseeable, fluctuations. Moreover, the market or markets on which these tokens
are traded do not offer the same guarantees that are generally applicable to conventional financial markets.” 2
Money laundering risk:
Any subscription to the ICO in order to carry out illegal operations such as money laundering will give rise
to an immediate denunciation by SGAT TECHNOLOGIES to the competent authorities and in particular to
TRACFIN (« Traitement du renseignement et action contre les circuits financiers clandestins »: a service of
the French Ministry of Finances responsible for fighting money laundering and terrorist financing.)

FOREWORD
But to get there, we are going to need more blockchain application users, more applications to create, and many
more developers. The era we are living in is comparable to that of the birth of the Internet, where the general
public was hearing about a technological revolution, without necessarily understanding how it works, but with a
clear understanding of its impact on the economy and society: «blockchain is like the Internet before the arrival of
the browser».
Just like the Internet economy, we are convinced that blockchain will create a new economy, a crypto-tech economy that will be rewarded if based on decentralized but controlled trust. The basis of blockchain is the transmission of values.
It is quite clear that the economy and society will experience major upheavals, which some qualify as a disruption,
and even a revolution. But it is not a «disruptive» technology, i.e. one capable of defying a traditional business
model by offering a low-cost solution that would quickly overtake the existing companies. In reality, it is a fundamental technology, a foundational one which has the potential to create new foundations for our economic and
social systems.
However, it will be some time before blockchain is established in our systems and its adoption will not be sudden,
but gradual and regular. In any case, true technological and institutional changes are underway, and a profound
mutation will undergo in many uses.
It is from this vision and its strategic implications that SGAT was born, and from the desire, the urge, to participate
in this adventure, that of a genuine transformation of the economy and governance initiated by the blockchain
which, however, will be gradual.
SGAT is above all a dynamic and passionate team that decided to combine their different skills and gather their
expertise in order to concretize, in an open and participatory approach, its vision, through the creation of a consulting and development company of services and applications based on blockchain technology.
SGAT adventure just only begun, we will do everything we can to make this project successful!

SGAT
Blockchain technology is the best tool of this decade. Versatile and modular, it is not
a single object but is composed of multiple parts. It offers an immense field of
exploitation and an infinite range of applications.
The message of the blockchain is simple, but strong: it’s all about innovation. Its survival
will depend on what we will do with it, and this will not be solely based on its technical
characteristics.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
SGAT is one of the first decentralized smart-contracts and blockchain-based platform. While focusing on
enhanced privacy and maintaining the transparency and security of our blockchain, we offer comprehensive
and tailor-made transactions. Our ambition is to offer innovative smart-contracts solutions adapted to the
challenges of today’s industries.
The blockchain is like a large accounting book distributed: one must imagine a very large notebook, which everyone can read, for free, on which everyone can write and impossible to erase. In short, it is a register protected against falsification by a system of trust shared among the participating members.
By its nature, blockchain is a decentralized technology shared by its members, bringing trust, sharing and
transparency. Blockchain technology is now applicable in many areas. We’re talking about use cases with many
sectors of activity already concerned : energy, health, cadastral management, digital voting, carpooling, food
processing, jewellery, luxury goods, insurance, banking... And among one of its main functionalities, «smart
contracts» that can automate many contractual relationships.
Bankers, notaries, insurers, auditors, bailiffs... The activity of many professionals – trusted third parties – is
transformed by a technology that allows peer-to-peer processing of all types of transactions. Disintermediation,
transparency, traceability and security are among the main key points of the promise of blockchain.
Understanding this technology, but also identifying the challenges, needs and problems of each industry, as
well as offering a private, confidential and business-friendly environment is SGAT mission. Through our ecosystem
and our tailor-made toolkit, we offer a powerful and evolutive infrastructure, adapted and modelled to the
specific needs of all sectors and business models.
The blockchain, how does it work?
How does it work:
The transaction is complete
Validation of the
transaction by
Someone requests a transaction the nodes
The requested
transaction is broadcast
to P2P network, the “nodes”
Once verified, the transaction is combined
with other transactions to create a new
block of data for the ledger.
The new block is then added to the existing blockchain,
in a way that is permanent and unalterable
A verified transaction can
involve cryptocurrency,
contracts, records or
other information

The real promise of the blockchain, what it will bring, is shared trust : trusted third parties can be replaced
by these distributed books which are more accurate, more transparent and less expensive. In fact, like other
industrial revolutions such as the steam engine or the Internet, the Blockchain will structurally change society.
SGAT has the ambition to be a strong player in this transformation, by developing its own blockchain and its
own crypto-currency, as well as a pre-blockchain application overlay. This platform will encompass all services
and applications developed by SGAT. These services will focus on smart-contracts to ultimately have concrete
applications that will be useful to everyone on a daily basis and in complete confidence.
The technology that SGAT develops will thus allow the configuration of smart-contracts without modification
of the source code of the blockchain. Therefore, the tool will be durable and scalable, able to be improved and
adapted in order to offer ever more comprehensive services, and in accordance with behavioral and regulatory
changes.
SGAT aims offering solutions in all sectors but cannot be present everywhere, even less develop all solutions
at the same time. That is why we have already preselected a few sectors to illustrate what SGAT could bring.
SGAT ecosystem
8
In addition to the development of SGAT blockchain and ecosystem, SGAT project will first and foremost
materialize through the inauguration of a physical gateway to this virtual world, the SGAT POINT: an all-pubic
meeting-place for exchanges and idea sharing dedicated to the world of crypto-curency and to a community
of neophytes, passionates and experts.
The SGAT Point will primarily meet a growing and vital need for the survival of the blockchain, that to bring
confidence to users in this technology but also to offer tools and resources to an active and committed crypto-tech community through Blockchain technology. It will be divided into two parts. First of all, a general-public
area that will include a small catering area – coffee type – as well as co-working or privatizable areas to host
various events. Finally, a private area, in order to receive SGAT’s corporates and commercial partners, and in
which part of SGAT teams will be located.
SGAT is the token at the heart of our ecosystem, allowing to access and use every services and applications
developed by us. For example, transfer of fiduciary securities, exchange of cryptocurrencies, member subscription and access and use of the smart-contracts tools.
Unlike Ethereum blockchain, the token SGAT is not ERC20 compliant and cannot be stored on any Ethereum
wallet which supports Ethereum’s protocol such as MyEtherWallet or Metamask. That is why our blockchain is
based on CryptoNote protocol.
In addition, we are developing our own smarts-contracts technology and have chosen to separate our
blockchain infrastructure from our smart-contracts tool infrastructure. This in order to create a modular and
scalable tool, ultimately leading to an ever more comprehensive and customized infrastructure.
Therefore, the SGAT that will delivered will be a full-fledged cryptocurrency like Monero, Dash, AEON, Bytecoin,
etc… offering further strengths :
• collaborative blockchain (possibility of mining)
• independency from Ethereum network
• creation of a brand-new smart-contracts technology
A unique token to access SGAT ecosystem and services
• Safe, fast and cheap transfer value
• Secured, private, untraceable and fungible
• Access and use of SGAT services
(crypto and fiat transfer value,
member subscription, SGAT Point…)

Let us take the case of Air France as an example : an IPO would consist in the purchase of Air France shares,
whereas an ICO would rather be the pre-buying of Passenger Miles. Their value is therefore supposed to be
based on the services ultimately provided by the company behind the ICO. So, the ICO is a meaning, a beginning,
not an ending. By proposing to support us, we invite you to take part in this adventure.
First, because ICOs are removing the barrier between professional and private investors. Anyone can rely on
promising services: you can thus become a Business Angel for SGAT in a very accessible and transparent way.
Indeed, we allow anyone who wishes to offer financial support to have direct access to our future pre-sale services,
and thus become the first users. This is why we offer the sale of our tokens which will be the unique way of
payment for our services and the use of our blockchain.
In fact, we are building, even before the opening of our blockchain, a large and eclectic community which will
be at the cutting edge of SGAT, both financially and in terms of SGAT’s values.

SGAT token characteristics
12,000,000 tokens will be in circulation if the token sale maximum hardcap is reached. Maximum supply is
however set at 30,120,000 through mining. Unsold tokens won’t be mined and even less burned but will be
leaved for further mining by the community.
Indeed, shortly after the official launch of SGAT webapp (Q4 2018), the source code will be published so that
our blockchain becomes collaborative and anyone can participate in the mining of SGAT blockchain.
SGAT is based on the CryptoNote protocol, an open-source protocol that ensures counterparty anonymity
and transaction confidentiality by using, for cryptography and mathematical logic enthusiasts, so-called circle
signatures and «Diffie-Hellman» key exchanges to make transactions untraceable, addresses and amounts
exchanged remaining hidden.

THE REVOLUTION 01 IN MOTION?
In order to allow even the very beginners to look at the exciting subject of blockchain technology and the
revolution it triggered, let us recall the basic principles underlying this technology4.
4 For more details on the technology – for the very beginners, or as a simple reminder – we invite you to check the informative and pedagogical memos
available for free in the SGAT library (SGATpedia), accessible to the memberds registered on the platform
DISTRIBUTED DATABASE
Each party on a blockchain has access to the entire database and its complete history.
No single party controls the data or the information. Every party can verify the records
of its transaction partners directly, without an intermediary.
PEER TO PEER TRANSMISSION
Communication occurs directly between peers instead of through a central node.
Each node stores and forwards information to all other nodes.
«It will take years to transform the business world, but the
adventure begins now» 3
3
 Quote from Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani, authors of « The Thruth About Blockchain »
TRANSPARENCY WITH PSEUDONYMITY
Every transaction and its associated value are visible to anyone with access to the system.
Each node, or user, on a blockchain has a unique 30-plus- character alphanumeric address
that identifies it. Users can choose to remain anonymous or provide proof of their identity
to others. Transactions occur between blockchain addresses.
IRREVERSIBILITY OF RECORDS
Once a transaction is entered in the database and the accounts are updated, the records
cannot be altered, because they’re linked to every transaction record that came before them
(hence the term “chain”). Various computational algorithms and approaches are deployed
to ensure that the recording on the database is permanent, chronologically ordered, and
available to all others on the network.
COMPUTATIONAL LOGIC
The digital nature of the registry means that transactions carried out on the blockchain can
be subject to IT logic and therefore programmed (coded). Users can define algorithms and
rules that automatically trigger transactions between network nodes.
14
Fields of exploitation of Blockchain technology are immense and we want to accompany and facilitate the
access to Blockchain services and applications in a real, sustainable and innovative economy, through a
network of quality partners, but more than anything passionate ones.
Through blockchain, our world is engaged in a series of deep changes capable of challenging our entire societal
model patiently built for nearly two centuries. It is quite clear that the economy and society will experience major
upheavals, which some qualify as a disruption, and even a revolution, and that a profound transformation will
take place in many uses.
But it is crucial, first of all, to apprehend and understand this revolution by briefly looking at previous revolutions
that impacted our economies and societies since the 18th century.

According to Carlota Perez, a Venezuelan scholar specialized on technology and socio-economic development,
and whose researches focused on the concept of techno-economic paradigm shifts and the theory of great
surges – a further development of Joseph Schumpeter’s work on Kondratieff waves – we can distinguish five
successive eras, including three industrial revolutions from 1771 to present. 5

17
3RD INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION: 1971 Age of Information and Telecomunications
CORE COUNTRY:
TRIGGERING EVENT:
The Intel microprocessor is announced in Santa Clara, California
NEW OR REDEFINED INDUSTRIES:
Cheap microelectronics, computers, software, telecommunications,
control instruments, computer-aided biotechnology and new “revolutionary”

World digital telecommunications (cable, fiber optics, radio and satellite),
internet, electronic mail and other e-services, high-speed multi-modal
physical transport links (by land, air and water). The Internet disrupted
the usual production paradigms by increasing the intensity of exchanges
on a global scale
Jeremy Rifkin, an American writer born in 1971, economic
and social theorist, described this new age of the information
and telecommunications as the «third industrial revolution»
(or “computer revolution” that would be distinct from the
traditional production sectors of activity and would have
started with the development of new information and
communication technologies).
18
We could also summarize the milestones of the “technological revolution” by:
But how would this evolution be a revolution?
What distinguishes a random collection of technology and justifies conceptualizing it as a revolution are two
basic features : the strong interconnectedness and interdependence of the participating systems in their
technologies and markets; and the capacity to transform profoundly the rest of the economy (and eventually
society).
The first is the most visible and defines what is popularly understood as “the revolution”; but in reality, it is the
second that makes it really warrant the term.
The technological revolution is that capacity to transform other industries and activities into
new industries that become the engines of growth for a long period of time while leading to
a significant rise in productivity across the economy, along with a vast reorganisation of the
socio-economic system.

From the computer revolution to the World Wide Web
19
The information revolution began in the 70s with the “mainframes” and has undergone a major evolution every
10 years : the PC in the 80s, Internet in the 90s, then social networks in 2000s. Blockchain technology would
then be the natural evolution of the past forty years.
However, according to many economists and researchers, a new source of energy is needed for an industrial
revolution to happen. We have successively seen the steam, the electricity, and the oil, but the computer
revolution of the 70s doesn’t have clean energy, even though it is still a revolution.
What if the energy of this new revolution was actually computer science, the Internet ? Isn’t the economy
and society at the heart of a radical transformation thanks to (or because of) this technological revolution?
Blockchain technology, or more widely that of the large distributed ledgers, isn’t it carried, conveyed and
amplified by the web network ? By adopting this reasoning, we are in the middle of a revolution.
Don Tapscott, author of Blockchain Revolution, declared in 1994 that «Blockchain represents the second era
of the Internet. We got the internet of information. With blockchain, we see the rise of the internet of value.
There is great potential to improve the economy and management of States.
Many experts actually say that the blockchain seems as revolutionary as the invention of the internet: in the
1990s and 2000s, it revolutionized society through data search as well as the joint use of information by online
communities. But blockchain goes even further, allowing the distribution and management of almost all types
of data, including ownership certificates, real and numerical values, and even identity-related data. In short,
this technology offers the possibility of distributing, updating and coordinating electronic lists practically in
real time.
Would we then be in the midst of creative destruction, synonymous of jobs and markets creation at the
expense of the destruction of other jobs and markets? Let us recall that in 1942, in Capitalism, Socialism
and Democracy, Schumpeter explained that «the new one doesn’t come from the old one, but appears next
to the old one, competes with it until ruining it».
We are convinced that this «World Wide Web” era with the internet and then the collaborative
economy reaches its climax through blockchain technology. By relying on the internet network, the
internet of things and artificial intelligence, this technology will allow making energy itself, cities,
buildings, cars, industries, trades, etc, smarter, in order to bring to our economy and society more
transparency, sharing and trust.
It seems that blockchain technology is the next revolution and that 2017 has been the year when organizations
and the general public discovered its first concrete applications. 2018 will most certainly be a year of confirmation and democratization among the general public and organizations, but more importantly a vital year to its
survival because of its regulatory and legal challenges.
20
It is the crisis of confidence and defiance towards companies that, at the turn of the 2007-2008 crisis, gave
birth to Bitcoin and then to blockchain technology as we know it today. A libertarian spirit blew on the finance
world, and that’s why banks and other financial institutions were the first to react to the rise of bitcoin and
attempted to get their hands across this technology which threatens disrupting them. Technology that, by
its nature, is decentralized and shared by its members, bringing trust, sharing and transparency. This is the
promise of the blockchain.
But it is clear that the economy and society won’t change and be transformed in a few months because of – or
thanks to – blockchain technology. We know, however, that the process is now underway and that few things
can stop it. While initiatives on crypto-currencies and public blockchains are being launched all over the world,
vast international blockchain projects are also being initiated by States and public or private organisations, and
States, financial and regulatory institutions are seriously considering the subject. The enthusiasm generated by
last G20 on the question of Bitcoin regulation is a convincing example. Through blockchain and the questioning
of our societal model, some of the major challenges facing today’s world are expressed.
But it is precisely by restricting it to known and recognized functions of the economy (monetary exchanges,
decentralized, simplified transactions, eviction of high-cost intermediaries), of production (modeling of tomorrow’s 4.0 enterprise, DAOs), of pure application (securing exchanges and data) or of governance (decentralization, consensus), that any forward-looking vision of the blockchain is prevented.
Through blockchain technology and distributed consensus protocols, the general public will very soon discover
disintermediation and digital currencies. New services offering instant and near-zero-cost transactions,
marketplaces and social networks without intermediaries (trusted third parties), or group insurances without a
central control body, but also autonomous and shared cars. We could even dream of transparent democracy,
of smart energies and cities...
Since 2008 the financial crisis, we gradually lost confidence in our banks and financial institutions, even stateowned... But blockchain could offer a new trust to our community, to «the other us», to the one who corresponds to us, who resembles us. A community through which could emerge a new economy and a new form
of governance and income distribution. Blockchain technology will now amplify what the Web has initiated
and developed.
It will perhaps succeed in this bet initiated by the Web to place more human, freedom and trust at the heart
of its technology and thus gradually shift us from a wikinomics world (collaborative) to a trustnomics world
(trust)... it is all what we must build. But blockchain is not the revolution so much announced, «it is only the
tool of a world itself entered in revolution»6
It directly questions at least five of these major challenges : value, money, work, the individual
and democracy; while technically being able to be used to address other important issues such as
environmental preservation or energy management.

Values of blockchain technology
21
THE PREMICES 02 OF SGAT PROJECT
Contracts, transactions, and the records of them are among the defining structures in our economic, legal, and
political systems. They protect assets and set organizational boundaries. They establish and verify identities
and chronicle events. They govern interactions among nations, organizations, communities, and individuals.
They guide managerial and social activities.
And yet, these critical tools and the bureaucracies formed to manage them have not kept up with the
economy’s digital transformation and in this digital world, the way we regulate and maintain administrative
control has to change. Blockchain promises to solve this problem.
This technology, at the heart of bitcoin and other virtual currencies, is an open and distributed ledger that can
record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. The ledger itself
can also be programmed to trigger transactions automatically. (See the sidebar “How Blockchain Works.”)
Indeed, virtually everyone has heard the claim that blockchain will revolutionize business and redefine companies
and economies. The enthusiasm generated by its potential is however seriously threatened by the media hype.
It is not only security issues – such as the collapse, in 2014, of MtGox, one of the largest bitcoin exchange
platforms at the time, or more recently, the hackings of other platforms – which preoccupies. Many barriers—
technological, organizational, of governance and even societal — will firdt have to fall.
But true blockchain-led of economy and governance initiated by the blockchain will not happen for many
years. Because it is not a «disruptive» technology, capable of challenging a traditional business model by
proposing a solution at lower cost and thus quickly supplanting existing companies.
Blockchain is actually a fundamental technology that has the potential to create new foundations for
our economic and social systems. However, it will take decades for it to take hold, and its adoption will not
be sudden, but gradual and steady, as successive waves of technological and institutional change accelerate.
With blockchain, we can imagine a world in which contracts are embedded in digital code and
stored in transparent, shared databases, where they are protected from deletion, tampering, and
revision. In this world every agreement, every process, every task, and every payment would have
a digital record and signature that could be identified, validated, stored, and shared. Intermediaries
like lawyers, brokers, and bankers might no longer be necessary. Individuals, organizations,
machines, and algorithms would freely transact and interact with one another with little friction.
This is the immense potential of blockchain. 
22
To understand why this transformation is inevitable, and has even been initiated for a long time, Marco Iansiti
and Karim R. Lakhani explain that we must first look at what we already know about the adoption of a technology,
and in particular about the transformation process specific to other fundamental technologies. One of the
most relevant examples is distributed network computing, born with the adoption of TCP/IP (Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocols, which laid the foundations for the development of the Internet.
Before jumping into blockchain strategy and investment, let’s reflect on what we know about technology
adoption and, in particular, the transformation process typical of other foundational technologies. One of
the most relevant examples is distributed computer networking technology, seen in the adoption of TCP/IP
(transmission control protocol/internet protocol), which laid the groundwork for the development of the internet.
Introduced in 1972, TCP/IP first gained traction in a single-use case: as the basis for e-mail among the researchers
on ARPAnet, the U.S. Department of Defense precursor to the commercial internet.
Before TCP/IP protocols, the architecture of telecommunications networks was based on «circuit switching», in
which connections between the two users or two machines had to be established in advance and maintained
throughout the exchange. To ensure communication between any two nodes, telecom service providers and
equipment manufacturers invested billions in building dedicated lines.
TCP/IP protocols burst into the mainstream with the advent of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s and
rapidly new technology companies emerged to provide the «plumbing» (hardware, software, and services needed
to connect to the network now open to the public and exchange information). Netscape commercialized
browsers, web servers, and other tools and components that accompanied the development and adoption of
Internet services and applications, while Sun led the development of Java, the application programming language.
From the exponential growth of information on the Web were then born Infoseek, Excite, AltaVista and Yahoo!,
to guide users around it.
When this basic infrastructure gained critical mass, a new generation of companies took advantage of this lowcost connection by creating Internet services that were compelling substitutes for existing businesses. CNET,
the information website put the news online, Amazon created a larger book offering than any other bookstore,
while Priceline and Expedia facilitated the purchase of airline tickets and introduced unprecedented transparency into the process. The ability of these new entrants to cover a large market at a relatively low cost has
logically put considerable pressure on traditional businesses such as newspapers and physical retailers.
TCP/IP protocols then disrupted this model by creating a public, open and shared network without any central authority or party responsible for its maintenance and improvement. In the late
1980s and early 1990s, an increasing number of companies, such as Sun, NeXT, Hewlett-Packard
and Silicon Graphics, used TCP/IP protocols, in part to create localized private networks within
organizations. They then developed technology bricks and tools that extended its use well beyond
the e-mail, gradually replacing the technologies and standards of more traditional local networks;
dramatic productivity gains were then observed.

Building on the very broad access to the Internet, the next wave of businesses generated new, transformative
applications that fundamentally changed the way businesses created and captured value. These companies
were given a «peer-to-peer» architecture and produced value by coordinating decentralized networks of users.
Ebay revolutionised online sales through auctions, Napster shaken up the music industry, Skype changed
telecommunications and Google transformed web search by exploiting user-generated links to deliver relevant
results.
It finally took more than thirty years for TCP/IP protocols to go through all these stages - single application, localized use, substitution and transformation – and reshape the economy. Today, more than half of the world’s
largest market capitalizations have Internet-driven, platform-based business models.
The very foundations of our economy have changed. The physical scale and exclusive intellectual property no
longer guarantee unbeatable advantages. Increasingly, business leaders are companies that position themselves
as «keystones», proactively organizing, influencing and coordinating large networks of communities, users and
organizations.
24
The parallels between the blockchain and TCP/IP protocols are obvious. Just as the e-mail makes it possible to
send bilateral messages, Bitcoin makes bilateral financial transactions possible. Blockchain development and
maintenance is open, decentralized and shared - like TCP/IP protocols. A team of volunteers around the world
maintains the basic software. And, like the e-mail, makes it possible to send bilateral messages, Bitcoin makes
bilateral financial transactions possible. And, like the e-mail, Bitcoin gained popularity thanks to a fairly small
but very enthusiastic community.
TCP/IP protocols released a new economic value by significantly lowering the cost of connections. Similarly,
the blockchain could significantly reduce transaction costs. This technology has the potential to become the
system of record for all transactions. If this were to happen, the emergence of new blockchain-based sources
of influence and control would once again make the economy undergo a radical change.
For any company, the continuous recording of transactions is one of the core functions. These recordings keep
track of past operations and performance, and guide planning for future goals. They provide an overview not
only of the company’s internal operations, but also of its external relationships. Each organization maintains
its own records, and these are private. Many companies do not have a master register of all their activities;
separate registers are kept within internal units and functions. The problem? Reconciling individual and private
transaction registers is time consuming and prone to error.
For example, a current stock transaction can be executed in a few microseconds, often without human intervention. However, settlement - the transfer of ownership of the stock - can take up to a full week. This is because the parties do not have access to their respective records and therefore cannot automatically verify that
the assets exist and can be transferred. Instead, a series of intermediaries act as guarantors as the transaction
is recorded within the organizations and the records are updated one by one.
In a blockchain system the registry is replicated in a large number of identical databases, each hosted and
maintained by one of the interested parties. When changes are recorded in one database, all other databases
are updated simultaneously. Thus, at the same time as transactions are made, the notification of the values
and assets exchanged are permanently entered in all registers. No need for a third-party intermediary to
verify or transfer ownership. If a stock transaction is carried out on a blockchain-based system, it would be
settled in a few seconds, securely and verifiably (the infamous hacks that hit the bitcoin exchanges highlighted
weaknesses specific not to the blockchain itself, but to the separate systems linked to certain users of the
blockchain).
Blockchain was launched in October 2008 as part of a virtual money offer, the Bitcoin, a system for
putting money into circulation, transferring ownership and confirming transactions, all without
central authority. Bitcoin is the first application of blockchain technology
The new architecture
25
If Bitcoin is like the first e-mails, will blockchain have to wait decades before reaching its full potential? It is very
likely that the answer is a qualified no unless you have a crystal ball it is impossible to predict exactly how long
the transformation will take, but you could guess what types of applications will be the first to gain ground and
how blockchain will eventually be widely adopted.
Still according to the analysis of Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani, history suggests that two parameters
influence the evolution of a foundational technology and its applications:
• the first is novelty, i.e. the degree to which the proposed application is new to the public :
the more innovative it is, the greater the efforts needed to make users understand the
problems it solves;
• the second dimension is complexity, represented by the level of ecosystem coordination
involved—the number and diversity of parties that need to work together to produce value
with the technology. For example, a social network with just one member is of little use; a
social network is worthwhile only when many of your own connections have signed on to it.
Other users of the application must be brought on board to generate value for all participants.
The same will be true for many blockchain applications. And, as the scale and impact of those
applications increase, their adoption will require significant institutional change.
They developed a diagram, divided into quadrants, characterizing certain innovations according to these two
contextual parameters (see exhibit).
01
02
A framework for blockchain adoption
26
Adoption of foundational technologies generally occurs in four phases. Each phase is characterized by the
novelty of the applications and the complexity of the coordination efforts required to make these applications
workable. Those with a relatively low degree of novelty and complexity will be accepted first. On the other
hand, if the degree of novelty and complexity of applications is high, they logically take decades to evolve but
can transform the economy. TCP/IP technology, introduced on Arpanet network in 1972, already reached the
transformation phase, but blockchain applications (in red) are still in their early days.
Each quadrant represents a stage of technological development. Identifying the quadrant in which a given
blockchain innovation fits into would help policy makers appreciate the challenges they face, the level of collaboration and consensus required, and the legislative and regulatory efforts required. This scheme would also
identify the processes and infrastructures to be put in place to facilitate the adoption of innovation.
Managers could use it to assess the stage of blockchain development in any industry, and to evaluate strategic
investments with regard to their own potential in this area.

SINGLE USE
LOCALIZATION
In the first quadrant, applications with a low level of novelty and coordination, offering better, less costly and
highly focused solutions. The e-mail, a cheap alternative to phone calls, faxes and snail mail, was a single-use
application for TCP/IP protocols (although its value increased with the number of users). Bitcoin also finds its
place in this quadrant: even in its early days, it offered immediate value to the few who used it as an alternative
method of payment. It can be considered as a complex form of e-mail capable of transferring not only information but also real value.
The second quadrant includes innovations that are relatively innovative but require only a limited number of
users to create immediate value, which facilitates their adoption. If the development of blockchain technology
follows the same path network technologies took it within companies, its innovations can be expected to rely
on single-use applications to create localized private networks to which multiple companies will be connected
through a decentralized register, notably in the financial services sector or in small companies’ networks, so
that the coordination required remains modest.
For example, NASDAQ works with chain.com, one of many blockchain infrastructure providers, to provide technology for processing and validating financial transactions. Bank of America, JPMorgan, The New York Stock
Exchange, Fidelity Investments and Standard Chartered but also French banks such as Société Générale, BNP
Paribas and Crédit Agricole are testing blockchain technology to replace paper-based and manual transactions
in several areas: trade finance, foreign exchange, cross-border settlements and securities settlement. And
the Bank of Canada is testing a digital currency, the CAD-coin, for interbank transfers, while the Central Bank
of Sweden, with e-krona, could become the first bank in the world to launch its own digital currency, despite
being the oldest in the world. It is expected that private blockchains serving specific purposes will proliferate in
various industries.
28
SUBSTITUTION
TRANSFORMATION
The third quadrant contains applications with a rather limited innovative character, as they are based on
existing single-use and localized applications, but with high coordination needs, as they assume to be used by
a broader and ever-growing public. These innovations aim to change whole areas of the way we do business.
Their adoption, however, faces serious obstacles.
Not only do they require more coordination, but the processes they hope to replace are sometimes still
flourishing and deeply embedded within companies and institutions. Cryptocurrencies are an example of
substitutes: they are new, fully formed currency systems derived from the simple payment technology like
Bitcoin. The essential difference is that cryptocurrency must be adopted by all parties involved in monetary
transactions, which means challenging governments and institutions that have long managed and supervised
these transactions. Users also need to change their behaviour and understand how to take advantage of the
potential of cryptocurrency.
It is in the fourth quadrant that we find the most innovative applications which, if successful, are likely to transform the very nature of economic, social and political systems. They involve coordinating the activities of many
actors and obtaining institutional agreement on standards and processes. Their adoption will require major
social, legal and political change.
Smart contracts are the most important transformation potential at the moment. They automate payments
and transfers of currency or other assets once trading conditions are met. For example, a smart contract could
trigger a payment order to a supplier as soon as a good is delivered. A company could report, via blockchain,
the receipt of a given commodity - or the product in question could be equipped with a GPS function that
would automatically record its new position, which in turn would trigger a payment order. Such contracts,
which are self-executing, have already been tested in the areas of corporate finance, banking and digital rights
management.
The consequences are of course fascinating; companies are built on contractual relationships, from their
creation to buyer-supplier relationships to the one with their employees. If contracts are automated, what
will happen to traditional corporate structures and processes, as well as intermediaries such as lawyers and
accountants? And what about managers? Their roles will radically change. However, it will be decades before
the adoption of smart-contracts actually becomes widespread, and considerable coordination and clarification
is needed in the design, monitoring, implementation and enforcement of smart contracts.
29
Understanding this technology, but also identifying the challenges, needs and issues of each industry, in order
to offer a private, confidential and applicable infrastructure to all is SGAT’s mission. Through our ecosystem
and thanks to our customized toolbox, we want to offer a powerful and scalable infrastructure, adapted and
modelled to the specific needs of all sectors.
The real promise of the blockchain, what it will bring, is shared trust: trusted third parties can be replaced by
these books distributed more just, more transparent and less expensive. In fact, like other industrial revolutions
such as the steam locomotive or the Internet, the blockchain will structurally change society.
SGAT has the ambition to be a powerful player in this transformation, by developing its own blockchain and its
own crypto-currency, as well as a pre-blockchain application overlay. This platform will encompass all services
and applications developed by SGAT. These services will focus on smart-contracts to ultimately have concrete
applications that will be useful to everyone on a daily basis and with complete confidence.
TO SUMMARIZE…
Whatever the context, blockchain technology is likely to have an impact on any industry.
The question is when. Everyone says it: blockchain will revolutionize the economy. But it will take
much longer than many people think. Like TCP/IP protocols (on the basis of which the Internet
was built), blockchain is a foundational technology that will require a widespread coordination.
The level of complexity - technological, regulatory, social and others - will be unprecedented.
However, the example of the adoption of TCP/IP protocols suggests a fairly predictable development of the blockchain. While the adventure will take years, it is in the interest of companies
to get ready for it now.

THE ECOSYSTEM 03 DEVELOPPED BY SGAT
With this vision and these convictions, SGAT wanted to build its foundations: on the one hand, its own
blockchain, offering reliability, confidentiality, security, ease of use and portability; and on the other hand,
a flexible, scalable and ergonomic ecosystem offering custom smart-contracts tools.
SGAT is one of the first decentralized smart-contracts platforms based on blockchain technology. By focusing
on increased confidentiality, while maintaining the transparency of our blockchain, as well as the highest
level of security, we offer complete and tailor-made transactions. Our ambition is to offer innovative smartscontracts solutions adapted to the challenges of today’s industries.
SGAT is the token at the heart of our ecosystem. It allows you to access and use all the services and applications
we develop on our platform. For example, transfer of fiduciary values, exchange of crypto-currencies, member
account subscription, access and use of smarts-contracts tools. This token is also the essential financial lever
for a healthy development – and independently of the financial and banking sphere – of our project. By placing
the SGAT at the heart of our ecosystem, we collectively have the opportunity to create an alternative to our
economy, or at least to begin a transformation of it, more communitarian and more committed.
In order to ensure a solid community of users and to rule out any illegal activity on SGAT blockchain, our
services and applications will only be accessible through the ecosystem developed by SGAT, which requires the
creation of a single account per user, subject to rigorous customer identification and anti-money laundering
procedures.
31
Any person or company wishing to access the services offered by SGAT Technologies must register on the
platform through the website or directly at the physical store that will open following the official launch of our
web application.
Most of all, we wish to accompany and facilitate access to blockchain technology, even for the most novices.
It is for this reason that we primarily adopt an educational approach and that any user registering on the
platform will be able to freely access the various memos and contents published and/or consolidatd by SGAT.
The first services that will be offered at the launch of the platform will also make it possible to reach various
targets in a wide sphere: individuals, users of crypto-currencies wishing to dispose, spend and transfer their
money, companies wishing to revolutionize or redefine their business, or simply position themselves in this
new crypto-tech economy and participate in its development.
Any SGAT user will be able to generate a SGAT electronic wallet supporting several cryptocurrencies, allowing
him to store them or exchange them for SGATs. This portfolio will be accessible from SGAT web application’s
user interface and will allow easy access to the various crypto-active balances and display the corresponding
QR codes or alphanumeric reception addresses. The cryptocurrencies that will initially be accepted at launch
will be Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Monero (XMR).
At any time, the user may request the conversion of his SGATs into cash (in euros), the details of which
(exchange rate and/or fees) will be presented to him before acceptance and transfer of the amount to the
account in his desired name.
SGAT wishes to address any user of crypto-currencies by proposing a crypto-wallet (electronic
wallet) as well as its own crypto-currency, true instrument of valorization of the community activity.
Therefore, SGAT token can be used to access the proposed services and applications or can simply
be saved and/or exchanged to support SGAT blockchain.
SGAT blockchain will record all transactions and flows generated by the use of our services and applications
but will in no case disclose the details of these. The characteristics and counterparts of these transactions
will therefore be stored and maintained through SGAT’s technical infrastructures. This pre-infrastructure
blockchain overlay will make it possible to maintain the private and/or confidential nature of transactions,
while ensuring their traceability, follow-up and due diligence, in particular for legal, audit or administrative
purposes.
The protection of users’ and commercial data will be and will remain one of SGAT’s priorities; more
than anything, we are committed providing the community a quality service, transparency regarding data protection and disclosure, and maintaining the highest level of security for our data and
servers. We also undertake not to share your personal data with anyone without your permission,
whether for commercial or advertising purposes.

In parallel with the launch of the blockchain, SGAT is developing a traditional payment service, but more importantly, its own smart-contracts tool. The technology that SGAT develops will indeed allow the configuration of
smart-contracts without modification of the source code of the blockchain. Therefore, the tool will be durable
and scalable, it will be able to be improved and adapted in order to offer ever more comprehensive services,
and in accordance with behavioural and regulatory changes.
SGAT
PAYMENTS
The service and payment mechanism developed by SGAT will be vital to the functioning of our ecosystem
and will allow in a very simple way to pay anything or anyone with SGAT. For example, it will be enough for a
merchant to be a SGAT member in order to be able to accept payment for his products via our application.
From his mobile phone and/or thanks to the smart card containing the crypto-wallet, a user will be able to pay
with his SGAT tokens with our partners.
The only private key of the corresponding SGAT wallet will be stored within the smart card, while a QR code will
be stored in the smartphone and displayed for payment. The SGAT card will be manged from the application
and controlled via a PIN code. The mobile application can be secured with a PIN code or biometric control.
In case of loss or theft of its SGAT card, and therefore of his electronic wallet, the user will have the possibility
to lock the card so that the SGAT wallet cannot be used via this smart card. It will then have the possibility to
restore the SGAT wallet thanks to a combination of words provided at the creation of its SGAT wallet. The user
will have to keep these words in a safe place, ideally on paper and not on an electronic support, even less on
a connected support or in the cloud.
SGAT services and applications
WHAT IS A
SMART-CONTRACT?
SGAT smart-contracts are computer programs that will record and/or execute the terms of a contract when
the deadlines expire and whose characteristics have been clearly defined beforehand. The aim is to satisfy
contractual conditions, such as terms of payment, delivery, but also confidentiality, and even the performance
of reciprocal obligations.
The digital and automated nature of the contract will enable two SGAT partners to establish a commercial
relationship without the need to trust each other beforehand, without any central authority or intervention.
It is indeed the system itself, and not a participant, that will guarantee the honesty of the transaction.
Electronic contracting has now become an integral part of companies’ dematerialization projects. Being able
to constitute, validate, exchange, approve and sign a contract electronically while being able to authenticate
the signatory has become a competitiveness issue for many companies.

These «autonomous « contracts will make it possible to securely record contractual information

dates will be kept. The blockchain will allow here to have an irrefutable and unfalsifiable digital
dated proof.
When the performance conditions are linked to time indicators or entries in the blockchain, the verification
will be done automatically. On the other hand, if it is necessary to verify an external condition (for example
that the package has been received), SGAT will act as trusted third party.
Companies will see many benefits in adopting this service, such as improved responsiveness through reduced
processing and response times, but also improved performance with increased conversion rate and better
service, but also better traceability, process control and security. The smart contracts service will also enable
companies to collaborate more effectively by sharing documents between the various parties. Finally, it will
help reduce costs (processing, editing or distribution...).
What does bring SGAT tool?
SGAT’s ambition is to offer, through this service, a tailor-made and comprehensive contractualisation tool,
adapted to both companies and individuals. The interface, settings and tools offered by this service will differ
between individuals and businesses – due to different needs – but will be adjusted and wil evolve according to
community voices. Similarly, the idea is to develop, for companies, a module specific to their sector of activity
or their needs in order to provide a tailor-made and evolving contracting tool.

Thanks to the smart-contracts technology that SGAT is developing, all elements are then brought together
so that we can offer to both companies and individuals a completely digitalized process in contracting.
There are 5 main challenges to which we will respond: efficiency and performance, simplification of the process,
digitalization, acceleration of the contracting process and compliance with regulations.
SGAT wants to offer solutions in all sectors but cannot be present everywhere, nor develop all solutions at
the same time. That is why we have already preselected a few sectors to illustrate what SGAT can bring.
We will also prioritize sectors based on community votes, business partnerships and the overall evolution
of the budget.
Above all, we wish to provide comprehensive contractualization tools, evolving under the impetus of a strong
and committed community.

In addition to the development of SGAT blockchain & platform and its smart-contracts tools, SGAT project will
first and foremost materialize through the inauguration of a physical gateway to this virtual world, the SGAT
POINT: an all-pubic meeting-place for exchanges and idea sharing dedicated to the world of crypto-curency
and to a community of neophytes, passionates and experts.
This place, divided into two parts, will above all respond to a growing and vital need for the survival of the
blockchain, that of bringing confidence to users in this technology but also to offer tools and resources to an
active and committed crypto-tech community thanks to the blockchain technology.

SGAT COFFEE will be a catering area “American Coffee” like opened to SGAT members, but also to the general
public. Prices will be displayed and payable in euros but will also be payable in SGAT.
Prepaid, non-rechargeable cards – which can be used withall SGAT partners – will also be sold in stores for
non-member customers who still wish to pay in SGAT.
Each transaction made will be processed by SGAT ecosystem and blockchain, ensuring a gradual increase and
stable flow of transactions. SGAT Coffee will offer high visibility but also bring stability and financial sustainability
to the company.
SGAT Area will be dedicated to companies and SGAT partners and will become the company’s head office.
Part of our teams and infrastructure will be located there, the purpose being to make it a workspace and client
reception area for SGAT corporate customers and partners.
A reception area for visitors and new customers who wish to become members will be set up, while one or
several SGAT counters for accessing our services will also be available for individuals and SGAT customers.

INTERNAL
GOVERNANCE AND
INTERNAL CONTROL
A Board of Directors must, in the long term, ensure sound and prudent management of risk management and
internal control, as well as of internal governance and risk allocation within the company. It will determine the
nature and extent of the company’s appetite and risk tolerance. The Board of Directors must also implement
internal control and audit while ensuring its proper execution.
MONITORING
CAPITAL
For example, payment institutions must present and guarantee a certain level of regulatory capital, but this
could be applied to any sound financial management of a company. Part of the SGAT tokens set in reserve as a
result of the ICO will therefore be determined with a similar guarantee. We will also apply an extreme level of
vigilance as to the origin of the funds coming from the ICO.
SGAT will not be a payment institution – status given to banking services (or banking alternatives) – because
our services will not allow the deposit of cash into a payment account or the management of a payment
account: the heart of our ecosystem is our cryptocurrency SGAT, and all services will only be accessible and
payable with it.
As explained above, all payment services will be handled through our token, and exchanges of fiduciary values
will be processed through smart-contract services. These services will be avaialale on SGAT web application
and registered on SGAT blockchain and private servers.
Thanks to our skills and knowledge of the banking sector, its regulatory culture and its compliance procedures,
we are fully aware – and wish to maintain this monitoring – of the way we need to understand the issues and
implications if our business and the world of cryptocurrency.
In order to ensure continuity and sustainability, SGAT must integrate certain financial, organizational, functional,
security and general compliance risk management requirements into the development of its services and
applications for the use of cryptocurrency – or at least try to anticipate them.

destination) to ensure compliance.
Inr relation to our proposed services – for example that of a smart-contract which would induce the escrow of
a significant sum – and in accordance with the requirements of protection of user funds, SGAT will protect and
segregate the funds it will receive in exchange for the execution of the said smart-contract, by depositing them
in a segregated account that we will hold with a credit institution (under NDA, «Non Disclosure Agreement»).
The funds held in such an account will then be separated from the equity of our company and the funds of any
other person. These funds will not be pooled at any time with the funds of any other persons or transaction
than the so-called smart-contract. These funds will not be used by our company as collateral to cover its own
obligations and the obligations of third parties may not be seized by its creditors and will not be part of our
company’s assets in the event of insolvency.
One of SGAT’s priorities is to ensure the quality and maintenance of our IT infrastructures at the highest level,
to have full control over them, and to ensure extreme vigilance with regard to the protection of confidential
data entrusted to us by users.
This is why SGAT relies, through four of its shareholders, on high-quality and experienced developers offering
valuable resources and tools to the SGAT project. An IT architecture in compliance will then be established and
will respond to the relative problems of architectures, geographical distribution of data, physical location of
equipments, subcontracting, system security, backup/restore, etc....

SGAT ICO, 04 WHAT IS IT?
Let us take the case of Air France as an example : an IPO would consist in the purchase of Air France shares,
whereas an ICO would rather be the pre-buying of Passenger Miles. Their value is therefore supposed to be
based on the services ultimately provided by the company behind the ICO. So, the ICO is a meaning, a beginning,
not an ending. By proposing to support us, we invite you to take part in this adventure.
First, because ICOs are removing the barrier between professional and private investors. Anyone can rely on
promising services: you can thus become a Business Angel for SGAT in a very accessible and transparent way.
Indeed, we allow anyone who wishes to offer financial support to have direct access to our future pre-sale
services, and thus become the first users. This is why we offer the sale of our tokens which will be the unique
way of payment for our services and the use of our blockchain.
In fact, we are building, even before the opening of our blockchain, a large and eclectic community which will
be at the cutting edge of SGAT, both financially and in terms of SGAT’s values.
SGAT token is offered at the unique price of 1 € / SGAT. The participative sale is organized in three phases :
SGAT token sales distribution
To participate in our ICO, investors will need to submit their KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML/CFT (Anti-Money
Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism) documents via the online form. Our compliance team to
conduct the necessary verification. Each participant will then receive a specific address to which it will be able
to send the payment to participate in the crowdsale.
A holder may transfer its SGATs under different conditions. With the exception of over-the-counter sales, SGAT
will make its best efforts to ensure that its tokens are accepted on various trading platforms (Bittrex, HitBTC,
Binance, etc.).
As SGAT must also regularly purchase its tokens in order to reward its holders, the company will have to make
its purchases on secondary market cryptocurrencies platforms like the ones mentioned above among others.
• a private pre-sale, for a maximum of € 500,000, including a 30% bonus on the number
of SGAT tokens delivered
• a public pre-sale, for a maximum of € 1,000,000, including a 15% bonus on the number
of SGAT tokens delivered
• a public sale, for a maximum of € 5,000,00

The funds collected through the ICO will primarily build the financial reservers to ensure a sustainable development of the project but will also ensure a certain reserve of crypto-assets (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum,
Monero, Dash, etc...).
The fund raising will also be used to finance the launch and development of the platform, to have sufficient
resources to develop and distribute the offer firstly in France, then in Europe and the rest of the world.
The softcap of our ICO, i.e. the minimum amount that we have to raise so that our project can be serenely
developed is € 1,500,000. That said, if the softcap is not reached, that does not mean that we will cancel the
project, but then we will have to find new sources of funding. The project has already been launched, developments also begun, the first newcomers have arrived, and the founders, who are already dedicated body and
soul to SGAT, will never give up until this beautiful project becomes a reality.
As for the hardcap of our ICO, i.e. the maximum amount we wish to raise, it is 6,500,000 €. Unlike many ICOs
wanting to raise dozens of millions of euros, we do not claim being able to use so much money in an economically viable way. In other words, it is unthinkable for a startup, while the project is only in its first phase, to
expect being able to quickly respond to the expectations placed in a blockchain project having raised dozens
of millions of euros. The development of such advanced technology requires in all cases time. On the other
hand, the correlation between allocated resources vs. strengthening and acceleration of development is only
efficient up to a certain limit. One only needs to look at the number of ICOs having raised such sums and then
had their token price collapse.
SGAT believes that it is necessary to capitalize its blockchain as the project moves forward and as SGAT’s cash
flow increases, in order to bring stability to our token price and thus protect itself from massive «pump &
dump» effects.

THE TECHNOLOGY 05 THAT SGAT DEVELOPS
SGAT blockchain and infrastructure is composed of two layers: a new high-performance public blockchain and an
innovative and scalable ecosystem focused on smart-contracts and blockchain applications.
Unlike Ethereum blockchain, SGAT token is not ERC20 compliant and cannot be stored on any Ethereum wallet
which supports Ethereum’s protocol such as MyEtherWallet or Metamask.
SGAT has chose to prioritise confidentiality and believes that this criterion is essential to a real adoption of smartcontracts tools by companies. This is why our blockchain is based on the CryptoNote protocol.
Therefore, the SGAT that will delivered will be a full-fledged cryptocurrency like Monero, Dash, AEON, Bytecoin,
etc… offering further strengths:
• collaborative blockchain (possibility of mining)
• independency from Ethereum network
-	 • reation of a brand new smart-contracts technology
SGAT is a state-of-the-art blockchain, offering improved reliability, privacy, security, ergonomy and
portability. It is based on the CryptoNote protocol
(like Monero) and is written in C / C++.
Even if the SGAT will not be a proper fork from
Monero (since we generated our own genesis block,
Monero code not allowing it), the code of the latter
has been reworked. Indeed, we are currently setting
up our blockchain and patching it progressively so
that it is in perfect synergy with SGAT web application.
That’s why we made the choice to be able to rework
the code from the start by generating our own
genesis block while the Monero code only allows to
make forks from their blockchain, to ultimately be
in full control of our technology, its evolution and
be master of the choices we will make. The code of
our blockchain can be viewed and audited on SGAT
Github.
SGAT blockchain
45
SGAT has always been a strong supporter of Monero, and considers it to be one of the most important cryptocurrencies, a precursor in the privatization of transactions, having one of the strongest and most competent
community and attracted some of the best experts in crypto-currency and some of the best talents in
engineering. So far, more than 240 developers have contributed to the Monero project, including 30 «core
developers». Forums and discussion channels are very active and various projects of development projects
are ongoing. The Monero’s Research Lab, a research laboratory composed of the Core Development Team
and Community Developpers, is constantly pushing the limits of what is possible with the confidentiality and
security of cryptocurrency. SGAT also wants to participate and contribute to the development of blockchains
based on the CryptoNote protocol by remaining very attentive to the evolutions and discussions coming from
the Monero community whilst sharing the code of our own blockchain and the patchs/forks that will follow.
By separating our blockchain infrastructure from
our smart-contracts tool infrastructure, we chose
to develop our own technology in order to build a
modular and scalable tool, leading to an ever more
comprehensive and customized infrastructure.
Our smart-contracts tool is an application overlay
integrated into SGAT ecosystem. It is written in Java,
built with React for the front, i.e. the user interface,
and in NodeJS for the back, i.e. the way the application is built.
Our own and private servers are hosted at Amazon
AWS (Amazon) and built on Ubuntu (Linux). AWS provides high-performance and easy-to-scale servers,
adapting very quickly to a strong increase in user
flow. In addition, AWS makes it easy to build and
run sophisticated and scalable applications. Several
sub-servers will also run smart-contracts tools which
will be mainly built on NodeJS.
Finally, our database works with MongoDB technology
for better scalability and flexibility.

Confidentiality of transactions is essential for financial institutions and corporates, but also for individuals. The
defence of anonymous ways of payment is one of our priorities.
CryptoNote is an open-source protocol ensuring counterparty anonymity and transaction confidentiality.
Unlike Bitcoin network, a blockchain administered via CryptoNote does not disclose the origin or destination
of the units. CryptoNote protocol uses ring signatures and “Diffie-Fellman” key exchanges to make untraceable
transactions, addresses and amounts remain hidden.
Snapshot on CryptoNote algorithm
Anonymity of the sender: 
ensured using several public keys to sign a transaction (ring signatures). Network nodes can prove
that the transaction has been signed by the sender,
without being able to identify the key that was used.
Protection against double spending: 
the ancestor of ring signatures (group signatures)
relied on a third party to protect the system from
double spendings. From now on, each stealth
address leaves a fingerprint in the blockchain and
the protocol rejects any transaction involving a
stealth address that has already been used.
Anonymity of the receiver: 
the protocol allows to generate a single-use pair key
for each transaction (stealth addresses). It is impossible for a third party to determine whether certain
transactions are sent to the same receiver.
«Egalitarian» proof of work: 
the system wants to ensure linearity between the
financial investment and the corresponding hash
power, regardless of the hardware used to mine.
47
SGAT TOKEN 06 CHARACTERISTICS
A maximum of 30,120,000 units can be generated through SGAT blockchain. This figure is irrevocable and no
further SGATs can be generated when the maximum is reached. The below chart represents the theoretical
daily emission curve assuming that it would not be interrupted. Blocks will be mined approximately every 60
seconds, ensuring fast transactions.
As part of the ICO, 12,000,000 SGAT tokens – or 40% of the total supply – will be in circulation if the maximum token
sales limit is reached. The remaining units can then be generated by the community through the mining process.
Unsold tokens from the ICO will not be mined, let alone burned, but may then be mined by the community.
Indeed, shortly after the official launch of SGAT webapp (Q4 2018), the source code will be published so that
our blockchain becomes collaborative and anyone can participate in the mining of SGAT blockchain.
A software, as well as a search website (SGAT Explorer), will be developed by SGAT to allow anyone to easily
consult the blockchain

SGAT is secure :
SGAT is a decentralized token, i.e. operated through
a network of users. Transactions are confirmed by
a distributed consensus, then immutably recorded
on the blockchain. Third-parties do not need to be
trusted to store, manage and protect your SGAT.
SGAT is untraceable :
By default, sending and receiving addresses as well
as processed amounts are obfuscated. Transactions
recorded on SGAT blockchain cannot be linked to a
particular user or to a real identity.
SGAT is private :
SGAT will use ring signatures, ensuring confidential
transactions and stealth addresses in order to
obfuscate the origins, amounts and counterparties
involved in these transactions. SGAT provides all the
benefits of a decentralized cryptocurrency, while
maintaining the private or confidential intrinsic nature
to exchanges between individuals or corporates.
SGAT is fungible :
Because of its private nature, SGAT is fungible by
default. Units of SGAT cannot be blacklisted by
exchanges or vendors due to their association in
previous transactions.

NICOLAS VAN SABERHAGEN8

ET SURAE NOETHER 08 9
Decentralization and anonymity are important in the financial world simply because of the inevitable conflicts of
interest between any centralizing authority and users. Man needs to be paid, and we need our privacy. It’s not a
bad thing, it’s just like that, but today, it can be solved with technology. Bitcoin was the very first decentralized,
peer-to-peer solution with an attempt at pseudonymization. According to Nicolas, there are very few other truly
unique and innovative solutions that have been proposed so far. Overall, the CryptoNote (CN) protocol was the
first real new advance in the crypto-currency environment after Bitcoin.
According to Nicolas Van Saberhagen, there are very few other truly unique and innovative solutions that have
been proposed so far. Overall, the CryptoNote (CN) protocol was the first true new advance in the crypto-currency environment after Bitcoin. One of the reasons which pushed SGAT to choose CryptoNote protocol is mainly for
its mathematical technicality in terms of anonymization and untraceability which is, from our point of view, the
most advanced to date.
Surae Noether published a very interesting report with his views as a mathematician and coder on CryptoNote
protocol. He criticises certain points and raises certain inconsistencies or incompleteness on Nicolas van Saberhagen’s paper that deserve to be highlighted.
But how does CN works ? Well, like everything that – in the world of crypto – works well, actually works strangely. CN protocol can be imagined as a post office box system. Each user has a set of public and private keys,
as within the Bitcoin protocol.
But instead of sending CrytpoNote directly to other public keys, users execute a Diffie-Hellman exchange and
create ring signatures to create a unique P.O. box in which the CNs are stored. When we send the CNs, we
include a «key image», which is nothing more than a hash of our private key and that of the final destination,
the one that gave us the right to send these CNs in the first place. If this key image has not been used yet,
then the corresponding one-time ring signature has not yet been spent either.
8 Nicolas van Saberhagen is the author of the whitepaer on CryptoNote, published on 17 October 2013. Very rich and interesting reading on the
technicality and mathematical logic of the protocol. Just like Satoshi Nakamoto (the author of the whitepaper on bitcoin), it is most certainly a pseudonym.
Its true identity and geographic location remain unknown. Some claim that the real creator is someome from bitcoin community.
9 Suraeh Noether s one of the developers of Monero’s Research Lab alongside Sarang Noether and Shen Noether. For the anecdote, their name is most
certainly a tribute to the famous mathematician Emmy Noether, one of the most important women in the history of mathematics. Similarly their initials
«SN», could be a nod to Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. He published in July 2014 his mathematician’s view on the whitepaper by Nicolas van
Saberhagen. Pour le consulter : https://downloads.getmonero.org/whitepaper_review.pdf.
«Diffie-Hellman» exhanges
51
It’s like if in a way we were saying, «So, you see that box over there ? There is 1 CN in it, and I have a private key
(K) to open it. With a Diffie-Hellman exchange, you create your own new private key (K*) and I create a new public address to which I will send my 1 CN. When I send my 1 CN, I will then announce my Im(K) key image that I
used to do it. Anyone who sees the transaction will check if my Im(K) image key has been used before to make
sure the PO Box still has my 1 CN inside. On your side, you now have a new private key (K*) corresponding to a
new mailbox containing my 1 CN.
Or, the way Surae likes to illustrate it, it’s like someone saying: “Everyone take your hands of the money while
it is being transferred around! It is simply enough to know that your keys can open that box... oh, wait, no! It’s
enough to know that a hash of your keys are equivalent to the location of that box! And that we know how
much money is in the box! Never put your fingerprints on the post-office-box or actually use it, just trade the
hashes of the keys that are equivalent to the locations of the boxes filled with cash! That way we don’t know
who sent what! But these trades are still friction-less, fungible, divisible, and still possess all the other nice
qualities of money we desire like in the Bitcoin protocol”. As strange and abstract as it may sound, that’s how
CryptoNote works.
Originally, group signatures were the first way to allow any public member of a group to anonymously sign a message on behalf of that group, and in which there was a group administrator who
could, at his own discretion, revoke the anonymity of any member of the group. The name «group
signature» annoyed the algebraists who actually invented cryptography...
For any fan of cryptography and mathematical logic, Nicolas van Saberhagen’s works on ring signatures in
particular is exciting. The story he tells is fascinating and Surae Noether sums it up perfectly in his writing.
Technicality and references
52
The untraceable ring signatures were then developed to remove the central point that was the group administrator. The name also annoyed the algebraists... Basically, if everyone has a pair of public and private key,
you just have to sign your message with your private key, as usual, then publish a key set mixing your friend’s
public key and yours, and then establish a specific protocol so that you can use that newly created key to verify
the message. Pretty simple! And so, it becomes impossible to establish «traceability».
Then linkable ring signatures appeared, which is surprising in reality, because the linkable terminology used in
all the documents shows that in reality it is really «not untraceable», or at least it is actually scalably traceable.
These are ring signatures in which the sender can basically lift his anonymity whenever he wishes.
After that, there were the traceables ring signatures – also quite surprising in their denomination because it is
difficult to see the link with «traceability» – which established a one-time method of using ring signatures. In
the end it is not very applicable – perhaps useful in a voting scheme – but definitely useful in any token-based
system.
Finally, ad hoc group signatures came along through which we have the possibility to choose the members of
our group on the fly.
Historically, there have therefore been:
• Group Signatures ;
• Untraceable Ring Signatures ;
• One-Time Use Scalably Traceable Ring Signatures; and
• Ad Hoc Group Signatures.
Nicolas van Saberhagen took everything, glued it all together, and got CryptoNote, actually pretty smart ! But
as Surae points out, it is not these terminologies that are important – they are never mentioned in his document – because all of this is part of the «old context of crypto-currency», this algorithm no longer has anything
to prove and has precisely shown the strongest resilience compared to other crypto-currencies. By this he
implies that, by experience, he has generally seen other attempts at crypto-money of this kind fail.
There are many little improvements when comparing the CryptoNote protocol compared to the Bitcoin one.
Your password is equivalent to your private keys, and each user only needs one address. There are no conflicts
between transactions. In the end, you can give away half of your private keys without fear of a security breach
from a third party, let’s say a payment intermediary...
Untraceability and unlinkability
53
Transactions are also untraceable on a large scale: according to van Saberhagen, a transaction is untraceable
if any sender is equiprobable, i.e. when a sender uses a public key generated by a ring signature, from an
attacker’s point of view, all members of that ring signature can be the sender equiprobably. It’s like a jamming
system (an obfuscating set), and scalable, in the sense that you can choose the size of your obfuscating set
(the degree of ambiguity is defined as the number of public keys composing your obfuscating set).
For van Saberhagen, untraceability and unlinkability are two desirable properties of a cryptocurrency. It then
defines a system as being untraceable, if for any incoming transaction, any sender is equiprobable, and unlinkable, if for any pair of transactions, it is impossible to prove that they were sent by the same person.
The term «impossible» is to be understood as «of probability that can be made arbitrarily small, if not zero».
According to van Saberhagen, two transactions are unlinkable if we cannot prove that they come
from the same person, and a system is unlikable if it is impossible to link two transactions. The
random oracle then assumes the existence of a perfect hash function, which is a bit unrealistic, but
which does not seem really close to the current hash functions. The only way would be to apply
under the standard model, but almost no cryptographic model is proven under the standard model.
No other developer has been able to prove anonymity in their crypto-currency. We must insist on
this point: no other cryptocurrency has the weight of mathematical proof behind their product.
Any user can generate an address that allows an audit of funds using only half of their keys. Transaction scripts
are very simple, global variables like block size and block reward adjust dynamically, so we don’t have to worry
about network consensus for infrastructure type code changes. Really, most of the good things about this
protocol are just a bunch of little things.
The most interesting is certainly the proof that transactions are unconditionally unlinkable or “unassociable” –
under the assumption of the Random Oracle Assumption, a kind of theoretical cryptographic black box
capable of generating a true random response to any query.
54
« ZERO-KNOWLEDGE »
PROOF
KEY IMAGES
The real question that arises from this protocol is obviously the fact that this one-time ring signature scheme
provides a very good anonymity, but as said just above, it is however not a «zero-knowledge» scheme.
Meaning that the unlinkability is made through an obfuscating set, and theoretically, an opponent with
the right tools would be able to recover these «crumbs» close to zero.
Indeed, a proof of zero knowledge would imply that it uses absolutely no information to build its proof.
The random oracle on the other hand, generates something «random», something unique, identifiable with
the keys, but in a way impossible to duplicate by anyone, but the information is in the function.
But if there was a God of Cryptography and Statistics, it could then look through this mortal function and
retrieve your private data...
CN protocol has implemented an element of cryptography never seen before in cryptocurrencies, especially
with the idea of using image keys to protect against double spending.
But it’s a boldly step on dangerous ground; no matter how many mathematicians or researchers have looked
at the algorithm, it’s quite possible that a 16-year-old kid, the new “Diffie of cryptography”, finds a way to crack
this encryption... If you gather all the knowledge in RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and ECDSA (Elliptic Curve
Digital Signature Algorithm), you know it can work and «it’s not because it can’t be seen that it’s not there».
On the other hand, given the number of brains and eyes that have been trying to crack open this «old cryptography» for a very long time, we can only let it stand the test of time...
Problems with the protocol
55
DYNAMIC
VARIABLES
Variables adjust dynamically over time (block size for example). This parameter is clearly positive in one sense
but can also have a very negative impact. Indeed, if we are not careful, it can lead either to blowups, on the
blockchain or to «wild fishtailing».
To understand, you must know that in CryptoNote, blocks can be rejected if their size is too large (more than
twice the median). This can, if it is a long-term attack, cause an exponential blowup of the blockchain. However,
this remains very unlikely, extremely costly, but still possible. In itself, a small-scale attack can be easily avoided
mathematically. Moreover, to discourage this kind of behaviour, the reward obtained by the confirmation of a
block is penalized if its size is abnormal.
