1. SUMMARY
The global eCommerce market has demonstrated explosive growth in the past couple of
years and its future is expected to be booming. In 2017, the global e-retail sales amounted
to 2.3 trillion U.S. dollars and projections show a growth of up to 4.48 trillion U.S. dollars
by 2021. This astonishing growth is primarily being driven by consumers using their mo-
bile devices to acquire goods and services.
In this ultra-competitive environment, finding and acquiring new customers can be a huge
challenge for merchants. In addition, 53% of adults living in high-income households
claim to be willing to switch brands for the sake of using a coupon.
The challenges for players in this giant market are key, including customer loyalty, achiev-
ing profitable long-term growth, and choosing the right technology and partners, among
others.
At the same time, the tremendous evolution of blockchain technology is radically chang-
ing the way many markets operate. Important USPs of blockchain like transparency, co-
herence, cost-effectiveness and effective integration with processes at all levels of the
business can bring to the e-commerce market endless opportunities.
Now, imagine the explosive combination of e-commerce, blockchain technology, and
cryptocurrencies: the IOU Platform, a true P2P e-commerce loyalty platform on the block-
chain.

A. E-COMMERCE LOYALTY
Finding and acquiring new customers can be a huge challenge. The reasons can be many,
but the customer loyalty stats don’t lie: it’s roughly 500% more expensive to convert new
ones than to keep current customers.
Fetching a new customer from the clutch of an eminent competitor is like an everlasting
headache for marketers5.
When it comes to personalized online experiences in the US, the most popular [factors]
were website optimized by the device (desktop, tablet, mobile) (64%) and promotional
offers for items the customer is strongly considering (59%)6.
An interesting finding: 53% of adults living in high-income households are willing to switch
brands for the sake of using a coupon7. This leads us to a major issue: the challenges that
e-commerce faces.

B. E-COMMERCE CHALLENGES
In the era of internet, e-commerce is the king. However, this exponentially growing market
faces some serious challenges:
1. CUSTOMER LOYALTY
It is a key issue as it takes lots of efforts for companies to make a new customer and main-
tain the same customer for long time.
One of the reasons why ecommerce companies face the struggle while building trust and
loyalty with customer, is because a seller and a buyer don’t know each other, nor they can
see each other while making a transaction unlike street-shopping. It takes few transac-
tions, time and plenty of efforts by the company to build the customer trust and loyalty8.
2. ACHIEVING PROFITABLE LONG-TERM GROWTH
Increasing sales is one way to grow the business but in the end, what matters most is prof-
itability. Online retailers must always find ways to cut inventory costs, improve marketing
efficiency, reduce overhead, reduce shipping costs, and control order returns.
3. CHOOSING THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY & PARTNERS
Some online retailers may face growth challenges because their technology is limiting
them, or they’ve hired the wrong partners/agencies to help them manage their projects.
Retailers wanting to achieve growth must build on a good technology foundation. They

must choose the right shopping cart solution, inventory management software, email soft-
ware, CRM systems, analytics and so much more. In addition, hiring the wrong partners
or agencies to help them implement projects may also limit their growth. Online retailers
must choose carefully who to work with9.

C. GROUPON FACTOR
Groupon, a true success story of pre Blockchain era, has taken advantage of the collective
buying power of its users to offer deep discounts for services and products. The business
model is a combination of coupon discounts and group buying. Coupon discounts and
group buying are old concepts which date back to the late 19th century and early 20th
century, respectively. In 1887, Asa Candler, a partner with the Coca-Cola Company, was
the first to utilize coupon discounts as an advertisement strategy. Candler made use of
various avenues such as magazines, mail, employees and sales representatives to distrib-
ute complimentary coupons to potential customers.
With over 100M total subscribers across over 500 cities in more than 50 countries, Groupon
is the largest player in the local deals market. The company, a pure-play on the local deals
segment with a proven success. Groupon offers “Deal of the Day” and other promotions on
their local markets and thereby guaranteeing revenue and large number of customers for
the local businesses. Local businesses do not have to pay upfront fees and need to share
revenue with Groupon only if the deal achieves the minimum subscription. Groupon offers
considerable savings to consumers who can discover services/merchandise that were not
known to them earlier.
Groupon backbone of success has been its strong partnership that it created with local
businesses breaking into new markets by researching the local market and identifying suc-
cessful local businesses which are approached by the Groupon sales personnel. Groupon
is best suited for high fixed cost businesses and business where the customer acquisition
cost is very high and businesses have to advertise a lot and their deals offer them a chan-
nel to reach out a target consumer based in the local market without paying any upfront

fees. Groupon is also best suited for businesses thriving on repeat customers such as spas
and restaurants.
With much success, however, Groupon has met many challenges:
•                                                                                                          Local Businesses Have to Figure out the Economics of the Deals. In some cases, local
businesses offered deals in which there was no cap on the number of subscribers
and the deal was oversubscribed. In such cases, local businesses ended up being
unable to meet the delivery expectations and incurred huge losses. Businesses with
unprofitable promotions have reported low rates of spending by Groupon users be-
yond the deals face value and low rates of return to the business again at full price.
•                                                                                                          Low Barriers to Entry and Low Switching costs. Groupon’s business model is easy to
copy, barriers to entry for the local deal market are low and switching costs for con-
sumers and local businesses are low.
•                                                                                                          Competition from other player is rapidly expanding to all cities in which Groupon is
offering deals. Groupon could also face competition from players in the local review
& search space such as Yelp, which has started offering deals.
•                                                                                                          Consumer retention is difficult. While most of Groupon consumers are deal-driven
and not long-term consumers its retention rate is about 20% which requires the
company to spend heavily into sales and marketing expensive resources. Groupon’s
consumer base is composed of deal seekers and bargain shoppers who are not will-
ing to make purchases beyond the deal. The majority of users make onetime pur-
chases at Groupon.

•  Low revenue share is not sustainable for its merchant partners. Groupon takes a
40%-50% of the revenue from its deals. This arrangement is not sustainable in the
long run as merchants learn quickly to move into search and other competitive ad-
vertising alternatives driving revenue away from Groupon by charging less.

3. BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY:
DISRUPTS THE MARKET
Blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions be-
tween two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.
“
Harvard Business Review
With blockchain, we can imagine a world in which contracts are embedded in digital code
and stored in transparent, shared databases, where they are protected from deletion, tam-
pering, and revision. In this world every agreement, every process, every task, and every
payment would have a digital record and signature that could be identified, validated,
stored, and shared. Intermediaries like lawyers, brokers, and bankers might no longer be
necessary. Individuals, organizations, machines, and algorithms would freely transact and
interact with one another with little friction. This is the immense potential of blockchain10.
Blockchain technology is taking over the world and disrupts the way many segments
work. In 2017, the global blockchain technology market was predicted to reach 339.5 mil-
lion U.S. dollars in size and is forecast to grow to 2.3 billion U.S. dollars by 2021.
The demand for distributed ledger technology, reduced total cost of ownership, rising
cryptocurrencies market cap and initial coin offerings, increasing demand for simplified
business processes, transparency and immutability, faster transactions, and Blockchain-
as-a-Service are said to fuel the growth of this market.

In addition, rising importance and adoption of blockchain for communication service pro-
viders, transformation of international trade and supply chain management, new breed
for programmable blockchain platforms, and high adoption of blockchain for payments,
smart contracts, and digital identities would create opportunities for the growth of this
market11.

Many corporate giants like IBM, Oracle are already using blockchain technology, while it is
increasingly being tested or used by companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Visa Inc.
to streamline supply chain, speed up payments and store records.
Almost six in 10 large corporations are considering using blockchain, according to a Juni-
per Research survey of 400 executives, managers and tech staff12.

A. BLOCKCHAIN & E-COMMERCE
Blockchain ecommerce seems to be the word of the year; well, more like for the years to
follow too. The early developments in the application of Blockchain and the proliferation
in its adoption says a lot about its future and how it could shape the world of ecommerce.
Alibaba, the ecommerce giant, is investing heavily into blockchain to track genuine food
products and verify the authenticity of the items.
Transparency, coherence, cost-effectiveness and effective integration with business pro-
cesses at all levels of the business are just a few USPs of blockchain. Irrespective of the
size of a business, (gradually) combining the strengths of blockchain with an e-commerce
business can present endless opportunities13.

4. IOU PLATFORM: THE ULTIMATE
COMBINATION
Now, imagine the explosive combination of e-commerce with blockchain technology and
cryptocurrencies: the IOU Platform.
IOU is a true P2P e-commerce loyalty platform on blockchain
“
It aims at empowering blockchain Merchants and Consumers with decentralized and se-
cure Peer-to-Peer technology driving customer satisfaction and loyalty through Merchant’s
trade-able IOUs.

22
A. IOU VISION
IOU reinvents existing loyalty systems in
order to provide more flexibility, control, and
enhanced benefits for Merchants in order to
guarantee the highest possible level of con-
sumer satisfaction for the incurred market-
ing expenditures.
IOU “loyalty system” allows business own-
ers to create a new level of interaction with
consumers and, most importantly, provides
the opportunity for consumers to freely ex-
change their IOU Offers with other consum-
ers for other IOUs which are needed more for
those trading parties.
IOU Peer-to-Peer (P2P) platform providing
new opportunities for each Merchant (Busi-
ness Merchant) in the world with regard to
loyalty system organization, interaction with
consumers, investment attraction, and reve-
nue growth by the means of issuing its own
freely tradable IOUs (IOU Crypto-Obligations
/ “IOU-CO”).

B. HOW IT WORKS
IOU offers complete transparency utilizing Blockchain

tages over the traditional e-commerce environment
making transactions Cost-Effective and Secure while
building ultimate trust between Merchants and Consum-
ers. Rating mechanism would boost a trust even further.

consumers beat the conventional digital payment meth-
ods as it removes the middlemen/payment processors
that take a big cut.
Not only consumers would feel secure and get significant
savings but also, they could use their purchased IOUs as
actual monetary assets which they will be able to trade
with other consumers or sell on the exchange. This is a
tremendous benefit of IOU Platform.
Loyalty factor is another huge benefit allowing both
consumers and merchants to get rewarded for gener-
ating top rated, quality offers and transactions on IOU

Loyalty factor is another huge benefit allowing
both consumers and merchants to get reward-
ed for generating top rated, quality offers and
transactions on IOU Exchange.
It is hard not to mention the ability for Mer-
chants and Consumers to donate some IOUs
for those in need and get rewarded for phil-
anthropic activities. Company would also
place donation requests on special causes and
would reward Merchants and Consumers, as
well as match such donations to benefit those
causes.

5. IOU INITIAL COIN OFFERING
(ICO)
IOU is launching a promising
Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
campaign and a utility
token IOUX.
This document is strictly private, confidential and personal to its recipients and should not be copied,
distributed or reproduced in whole or in part, nor passed to any third party.




31
A. TOKEN UTILIZATION
The token IOUX is expected to be utilized in many ways, including:
•  Escrow Management
•  VIP Merchant Status
•  Consumer Purchases of IOU Merchant Offers
•  Loyalty Token Grants
•  Promotional Offers
Merchants must pay 5% Gas fee in IOUX Tokens for every IOU offer issued for Consumers
(in addition to the 5% Fee on any purchases made by other cryptocurrencies, while pur-
chases made by IOUX Tokens would be exempt).
In exchange, to provide incentives for the IOUX Token holders, every IOUX Token transac-
tion would be granted an additional 5% Discount to the Consumers. Additional 10 Loyalty
Tokens would be given equally each time to both Merchants and Consumers after accumu-
lating transactions of 1,000 Tokens.
Merchants would also have an option to Guarantee the Service and issue refunds of pay-
ments if product or service offered by their IOU offers was not satisfactory. Thus, addition-
al IOUX Tokens would be escrowed until the completion of the term of the IOU Offer.
During issuance of IOU offers, Merchants must agree to the Token Discount, Service Guar-
antee, and Gas Fee Terms.
