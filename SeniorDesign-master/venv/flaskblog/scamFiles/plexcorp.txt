Section 02
Introduction
Thank you for your interest in this white paper. We worked hard in order to provide you
with intelligible and detailed information on our company.
People who are used to reading white papers will notice that this one is slightly different.
Keep in mind that our products are intended for the general public and not only for
cryptocurrency  experts.  We  thus  simplified  certain  passages  and  provided  detailed
explanations. This may seem banal to some people, but it is necessary for the novices of
the field.
This document is not a prospectus. It was constituted for informational purposes
only, in order to present PlexCorps' products. No purchase is necessary. You are
free to take part in the project or not. It is your responsibility to review the existing
laws  in  your  country  before  buying  PlexCoin.  You  must  read,  understand  and
accept the terms of this document before involving yourself in the project.
2.1.   Who are we?
PlexCoin is the first product offered by PlexCorps. Who is behind PlexCorps? We
currently are a team of 53 people, men and women from all over the world who
have a common goal: improving global financial services by simplifying the use of
cryptocurrency in a manner that everybody can easily integrate it in their life. In
other words, we are here to change the financial world as we currently know it.
2.2.   Confidentiality
Since the launch of www.plexcoin.com and of our Facebook page, people ask us
why did we not publish our white paper since the beginning, just like other ICOs.
One of the many reasons that influenced this decision is that we are different. We
do not copy others' websites, documents or systems. PlexCoin has one goal, and
its team will never lose sight of it. We do not compare ourselves to other ICOs.
Let's take a look at the main reason why we did not make the white paper available
before now.
Lately, lots of companies and organizations have launched their own ICO. There
are new ones every day. People want to easily finance the development of their
company. Every idea can be good; you may want to fund decentralized dental
services or you may want to decentralize instant messaging services.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                                   4 of 56




We wanted to avoid a tricky situation: a situation in which people could have read
our  white  paper  and  develop  our  concept  before  we  even  launch  it.  We  thus
decided to make you linger a little bit! Here it is, and our pre-sale begins in a few
hours.
We  know  that  eventually,  we  will  have  to  display  the  names  of  some  of  our
executives. However, we will try to remain discreet until all of our projects are
launched. Nonetheless, we will never mention the names of our employees and
subcontractors. This rule is paramount for our projects' security and for the people
around us to remain safe.
2.3.                                                                                      Team background
                                                                                          More and more people join our team every day. Experts of their own field bring
                                                                                          their contribution to our ambitious project, which is to change the financial world.
                                                                                          In our entourage, there are:
-                                                                                         Former managers of the finance field;

-                                                                                         Lawyers, notaries, accountants and renowned tax experts;
-                                                                                         A business development manager;
-                                                                                         A risk management supervisor;
-                                                                                         A regulation manager;
-                                                                                         A marketing manager;
-                                                                                         A complete team of programmers-analysts;
-                                                                                         A back-end, front-end and network architects team;
-                                                                                         A renowned network security and Cloud specialist;
-                                                                                         A large team responsible for the social networks;
-                                                                                         A large customer service team;
PlexCorps gathers all types of specialists for the accomplishment of its mission.
The team grows rapidly. If after reading this white paper you wish to join us and if
you think that you can bring valuable expertise to the company, please send your
résumé and a transmittal letter at info@plexcorps.com.

Specialists distribution under six categories:
Management                                                                            Programming   Security   Client  service   Legal   Subcontractors
2.4.   Our experience
A lot of PlexCorps' team members have solid experience with cryptocurrency and
with blockchain technology. Indeed, we hire the best people of each area. This has
become possible thanks to a company structure that allows employees to work
remotely. Instead of only hiring people who are from around our offices, we can
see the bigger picture and have access to the best of the best, no matter where
they are around the world.
We learn new things each and every day. Even if we are surrounded by the best of
each field, we advocate for knowledge sharing between employees. We are ready
to take on any challenge. We have run feasibility studies for our projects. We know
that we can deliver our projects within the deadlines.
Important: The decision to buy PlexCoin or not should not be made solely on the
company's information or according to the information provided on our personnel.
You must think about the potential success of the product and think about how we
will change and improve the financial sector.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                          6 of 56




2.5.                                                                                     Message from the President
Motivated by our willingness to meet the members' expectations, we can affirm
today with pride that PlexCorps will have a major impact on the cryptocurrency
world.  We  are  focused  on  our  mission  more  than  ever.  We  want  to  make  the
cryptocurrency technology accessible to all by simplifying its management and use
to the maximum. The banking sector and the finance world will have to converge to
the cryptocurrency path in a near future.
In order to achieve our goal, we rely on five strategical linchpins. According to us,
they are essential for success and growth. Here they are:
-                                                                                        Ensure that our members live the best experience;
-                                                                                        Distinguish  ourselves  by  offering  unique  and  effective  quality  products  and
services;
-                                                                                        Deploy our unique strategy, which is doing things differently;
-                                                                                        Surround ourselves with the most talented team;
-                                                                                        Access  some  financial  flexibility  in  order  to  invest  in  our  most  promising
projects.
We are proud to tell to each member that they are at the heart of every decision of
the  company.  We  always  go  the  extra  mile  for  our  customers.  At  the
decentralization and cryptocurrency era, we are fully engaged in connecting with
our members, wherever they are.
It is a fact that applies to each of our products!
PlexCorps will keep on growing by focusing on client satisfaction, on the talent of
its employees, on innovation and on the performance of its products.
President, CEO
PlexCorps
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                             7 of 56




2.6.                                                                                           Anonymity
PlexCorps' and PlexCoin's priorities are your safety and the confidentiality of your
operations. How do you want us to be able to guarantee you a total confidentiality
if  we  reveal  our  identity?  Any  organization  could  then  contact  us,  visit  us  and
scrutinize our operations (and yours)! This is not what we want.
We   are   not   funding   a   standard   credit   card   company   or   an   insurance
decentralization company. We are talking about a major change in the financial
system. Are you not tired of paying substantial fees to your bank? They make
billions of dollars every year! These financial institutions lend you money that does
not even belong to them, at a high interest rate. This money comes from people's
savings accounts, and they only give back a tiny amount.
The 1 000 richest banks cumulated a profit of 920 billion dollars in 2013, according
to The Banker's ranking. (RE: 01)
We are talking about 2013. Imagine what it is today, in 2017, and what it will be in
2018 and 2019. We have to stop this phenomenon.
This is the main reason why we will remain quiet for as long as possible as to our
identity. We want to improve our services and keep on improving them. We are
convinced that our projects will make today's banks almost unnecessary.
This will be disturbing. For safety purposes, we decided to remain anonymous,
even if it means to work harder in order to earn people's trust. We are persuaded
that you will learn to trust us over time.
Important:  You  are  free  to  not  take  part  in  this  ICO  if  the  fact  that  we  are
remaining  anonymous  in  order  to  provide  a  competitive  product  makes  you
uncomfortable. You can watch the train go by and lose the chance to be part of a
great change if this is what you wish.
2.7.  Our offices
Our offices are currently based in the heart of Singapore. Our team works remotely
and is located all over the world. We embrace this type of organization because we
do not rely on the availability of our offices in order to provide services. We are
able to keep on working in case of any extreme situation such as a power failure, a
major accident, a fire or a flood at the headquarters. Not depending on a physical
area to provide services is a great thing. It reduces the risk of dependence to a
sole workplace.
We are in the process of opening new offices in Switzerland, in the Bern area.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                                   8 of 56




2.8.  The market
The global money market is enormous, and more and more virtualized, which is
very profitable to us. Indeed, paper money is on the path to extinction. It is very
difficult, if not impossible, to carry US$ 100 000 cash confidentially from Paris to
Miami. The only way to successfully do that is by an interbank transfer, which
means that financial institutions and governments can look up your transaction. In
other words, you are not totally free to use your money how you want to.
How much money is in circulation on the planet? First, you need to know that
about 90% of the money is virtual. Indeed, only 10% of all the money is found in
the form of either bills or coins.
In terms of numbers, we estimated that in 2013 there were about 10 trillion dollars
(US)  circulating  around  the  world.  Moreover,  we  acknowledge  an  exponential
increase of the total global value of money. (REF: 02)
The potential cryptocurrency market is wide and within our reach. The only missing
elements are easy-to-use and accessible tools.
2.9.   Issues
Many issues with cryptocurrency have been reported. The most important of them
concerns its process of purchase, of sale and of exchange. This is perhaps not
true for a young adult to whom the computing world has no secrets and who learns
quickly, but for a person who is less accustomed to the field, it may be completely
different. Another problem is the misunderstanding of cryptocurrency. The majority
of people are novices of cryptocurrency even if it has existed for almost 10 years
and if it is being discussed in the media. The third major problem with this concept
is insecurity. If properly used, cryptocurrency is safer than any other currency. It
has to be wisely used, though. A fourth issue has been raised: volatility. We will
resolve this issue with PlexBank. For example, you could go to sleep one night and
own US$ 100 000.00 in Bitcoin, and wake up the next morning with a balance of
US$ 70 000.00. Scary, isn't it?
2.10. Solutions
We simplified PlexCoin's purchase, sale and exchange methods to the maximum.
No  more  need  to  transfer  your  cryptocurrency  to  an  exchange  platform  like
Poloniex or Bittrex. You will be able to make all your transactions straight from
your  PlexWallet.  However,  if  you  desire  to  exchange  your  PlexCoin  for  other
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                             9 of 56




cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, you must transfer them to an exchange
platform or wait for the launch of PlexWallet.
We also resolve the misunderstanding issue by approaching people in a new way.
We regularly update our FAQ and we make available a chat service that will be
accessible  24/7  when  we  launch  our  currency  on  the  market.  Moreover,  our
interfaces are more ergonomic and user-friendly than those of the competition.
We cannot afford to take risks in terms of security. Our systems are replicated by a
number of servers around the world and your PlexCoin are transferred as of the
moment you buy them into your private wallet. PlexCoin's priority is and will always
remain your security. Again, this is one of the reasons why we want to remain
anonymous.  We  want  to  avoid  attacks  against  the  company  or  against  its
employees.  We  want  to  prevent  an  attack  from  negatively  affecting  our  strong
system structure.
PlexBank will quickly guarantee the value of your cryptocurrency in order to never
receive  unpleasant  surprises.  We  will  get  back  to  this  point  further  in  this
document.
2.11. Security, our priority
Multiple  people  do  not  understand  the  reason  why  our  IT  systems  are  hidden
behind a proxy.
A proxy is a computer software component that plays the role of an intermediary
between two hosts in order to facilitate or to monitor their exchanges.
In  the  context  of  computer  networks,  a  proxy  is  a  program  that  serves  as  an
intermediary to access another network, generally the Internet. By extension, we
also  call  a  proxy  a  device  like  a  server,  implemented  to  ensure  the  good
functioning of such services. (REF: 03)
This is carried out to increase your security. We use the renowned services of
www.cloudflare.com in order to keep our servers' position secret. This service also
avoids possible DDoS attacks and prevents hackers from negatively affecting our
good workings.
Many well-known companies such as CISCO, DigitalOcean, Zendesk and Nasdaq
use this service.

A global network designed for exponential evolution.
A capacity of 10 terabits per second and more than 115 datacenters.
We are the only ones who use security through obscurity in the cryptocurrency
world. Even if a few sceptics are not into this measure, we intend to pursue this
path.
The  concept  of  security  through/by  obscurity  relies  on  non-disclosure  of
information  related  to  the  structure,  the  functioning  and  implementation  of  the
object or of the considered process in order to protect its security. This applies to
the sensitive fields of computing, cryptology, weapons, etc. (REF: 04)
We  prefer  to  increase  the  security  level  and  to  offer  you  maximum  protection
instead  of  doing  just  like  others  and  only  try  to  gather  the  highest  number  of
members, thus face high risks of attacks or risk any control failure.

DNS Reflection Attack Without CloudFlare
The  attacker  gathers  resources,  like  botnets  or  unsecured  DNS  recursion,  and
imitates the target’s IP address. The resources then send a flood of replies to the
target, knocking it offline.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                             12 of 56




DNS Reflection Attack With CloudFlare
The  attacker  gathers  resources,  like  botnets  or  unsecured  DNS  recursion,  and
imitates the target’s IP address. The resources then send a flood of replies to the
target, but PlexCorps regionally blocks their points-of-presence. Legitimate traffic
can still access the web property.
Moreover, our client identification and registration systems are rigorously protected
against hijacking.
Domain hijacking can occur at the registrar level if an attacker compromises a
registrar account and changes the nameserver or other registration information
associated with a domain. The registrar, believing that the changes originated from
an authorized registrant, sends the new information to the registry.
Recently, various ICOs underwent this type of attacks, making them lose millions
of dollars. PlexCoin’s security budget is huge. We use every available means to
protect you, your personal information and your money.
Even if we intend to create a very simple white paper, we still have to include
technical information for important buyers or organizations that could be interested
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                             13 of 56




in  PlexCorps’  products.  Here  is  the  structure  that  we  use  to  block  hijacking
attempts.
2.12. Our mission
PlexCoin is a company founded by and is made up of entrepreneurs and finance
professionals with a strong desire to change the financial world that we live in
today by simplifying to the maximum the access to cryptocurrency, the future’s
currency. Its mission is to increase the number of possible uses and to increase its
number of users by streamlining its management process. We are here to provide
you with the option to use your money the way you want to, without having to pay
astronomical fees to international banks, which already have the monopoly since a
long  time.  We  must  go  the  opposite  way.  It  is  our  main  engagement  and  the
reason why PlexCorps works day in and day out. We will advocate for this mission
until it is accomplished, and until our members are fully satisfied with our products.
"Take control of YOUR money!"
PlexCoin makes available the necessary tools in order to use money in a totally
private  and  safe  way.  Stop  giving  away  money  to  governments  and  financial
institutions that monitor all your transactions.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                               14 of 56




2.13. Our motivation
Why are we doing all of this, exactly? Our main motivation is to provide absolute
financial  independence.  We  will  give  you  the  possibility  to  control  your  money
without supervision. No more bounced cheques, no more  lengthy transfers, no
more frozen funds, no more withdrawal limits at ATMs, no more frozen funds on
deposit, etc. Stop depending on banks that make billions of dollars.
We are motivated to change the banking sector and the finance world. We are
convinced that we will achieve our goal. The best way to predict the future is to
create it.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                                15 of 56




Section 03
Abstract of our projects
PlexCorps will eventually comprise multiple products related to the financial field. We will
explain  briefly  them  hereunder.  A  white  paper  will  be  published  to  provide  you  with
further information before the launch of each product.
3.1.  PlexCoin
PlexCoin is a cryptocurrency (private Internet monetary currency) that has a value
based on the current market. In other words, PlexCoin is an entirely decentralized
open code global currency. Your transactions will not be managed or monitored by
traditional banking institutions. The users can now anonymously control their own
finances.
In  comparison  with  Bitcoin                                                                      (45  minutes),  PlexCoin’s  transactions                                            (deposit,
                                                                                                   withdrawal, purchase, sale, transfer) are confirmed more rapidly (30 seconds) and
have enhanced storage efficiency.
PlexCoin’s  revolutionary  operational  structure  is  safer  than  that  of  current
cryptocurrencies and is a lot simpler to use.
PlexCoin may be used just like traditional money to pay bills or on the market to
buy, sell or exchange for other currencies.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                                       16 of 56




3.2.  PlexWallet
PlexWallet will be available on PC, on MAC and as a mobile application that you
may download from the App store or from Google Apps. PlexWallet will give you
the freedom to manage your money, to transfer funds, to buy or sell PlexCoin, to
give money to your contacts or to pay your bills.
You will also have access to useful options such as a budget tab and a market
evaluation tab. You will even have the possibility to configure automatic PlexCoin
buying and selling options.
Every  transaction  made  from  the  PlexWallet  will  come  at  no  fee!  They  will  be
totally safe and immune to prying eyes. It will be possible to use PlexWallet from
anywhere in the world. For example, a member may transfer US$ 100 000.00 from
Dubai to Paris in a few seconds, without the funds to be frozen and without facing
banking beaurocracy issues. PlexWallet will be an essential tool for your financial
operations and will include all of our products.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                                17 of 56




3.3.  PlexCard
Revolutionary and unprecedented, PlexCard will be accepted everywhere in the
world,  regardless  of  your  country’s  currency.  Your  card  will  adapt  to  the
geographical  area  in  which  you  are  located.  PlexCard  will  be  linked  to  your
PlexWallet and to your PlexCoin. When you make a purchase with the card, our
system will target the best available exchange rate and will debit your account of
the exact PlexCoin amount corresponding to your purchase in order to confirm the
transaction.
No more credit limit, no more questions on your transactions. You will be the only
one to control your finances. We unceasingly repeat that no person or company
will be able to consult your transactions. Therefore, we cannot directly deal with
VISA. We thus deal with a sister company that issues VISA cards and that meets
our expectations.
There already exist similar cards on the market that displays the VISA logo, that
are accepted by VISA terminals, but that are not issued by VISA. Our difference?
We will offer options that do not exist yet and provide enhanced security. We will
also offer a PlexCoin rewards bonus program on all purchases.
Therefore, we do not have a direct agreement with VISA, but we provide credit
cards that will be accepted everywhere and that will be directly connected to your
PlexCoin. At the time of writing these lines, we are assessing our cards, and the
result is definitely up to our expectations
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                              18 of 56




3.4.  PlexBank
Here  is  our  most  important  product;  the  one  that  will  change  the  way  people
perceive  and  use  the  current  banking  system.  PlexBank  will  offer  you  the
possibility  to  manage  all  your  favourite  cryptocurrencies                            (Bitcoin,  Ethereum,
Litecoin, Ripple, etc.) in a single place.
Obviously, your PlexCard will also be connected to your bank account to manage
payments  and  to  manage  received  purchase  bonuses.  The  most  important
PlexBank innovation will be the cryptocurrency securing option. In one click, you
might  freeze  the  value  of  one  or  more  cryptocurrencies  from  your  PlexBank
account: even if the value of one of your cryptocurrencies decreases, your own
value will remain the same.
Here is an example. You own 100 Ethereum, of a value of US$ 100 each, which
equals to a US$ 10 000 total value. You leave on a trip in a few hours and you
decide to freeze your asset through PlexBank. When you come back from your
vacation, you notice that the Ethereum value has dropped to US$ 60, a loss of
US$ 40 per Ethereum. Since you have frozen your asset before you left, you still
own a value of US$ 10 000 in your PlexBank account. Therefore, if you unfreeze
your money, PlexBank will not deposit 100 Ethereum in your account, it will deposit
166.66 Ehereum, of a total value of US$ 10 000 because of the current cost of the
Ethereum
This will be one of the options offered by PlexBank. This is something that does
not exist at the moment of writing these lines. We are confident about the success
of this option.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                               19 of 56




3.5.  PlexCorps
These products are ideas and innovations that stem from PlexCorps. We will work
blood, sweat and tears in the next months to develop the financial products that
will help you understand cryptocurrencies better and to use them wisely.   We are
open to any novelty in terms of product offering, but we remain firm regarding our
position. Each of our products will always respect these criteria:
-                                                                                           Decentralized;
-                                                                                           Innovative;
-                                                                                           Related to finance;
-                                                                                           User-friendly;
-                                                                                           Private;
-                                                                                           Available to everyone.
An idea that would gather all these criteria would be seriously taken into account,
assessed by our team and possibly developed. PlexCorps evaluates its number of
employees to almost  100 by the end of  2018, and to almost  300 by the end of
2019.
PlexCorps' products are linked by a strong decentralized authentification structure
intended  to  block  attacks  from  mischievous  people  and  to  prevent  all  types  of
potential attacks regarding your personal information and your money.
Here  is  a  simplified  illustration  of  the  general  mechanism  of  the  PlexCorps,
PlexCoin, PlexBank, Plex Wallet and PlexCard operational structure.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                                20 of 56




Section 04
The PlexCoin project
Innovation is terrifying, but cryptocurrency is there for the long haul and to change the
world. We already observe this phenomenon.
We notice an increase in the number of companies from different sectors that are taking
their first steps towards adopting the blockchain technology. They understand that it is
pressing to be ahead of the competition. The principal interest of the sector is shown by
technology giants (Microsoft, IBM, Amazon), by Wall Street’s biggest banks (JPMorgan,
Citigroup) and by companies that work on products based on the blockchain technology,
supporting the financial sector like Infosys, TCS and HCL. R3 was the first blockchain
company in the finance industry. Founded in 2014, it now manages a consortium of 70
of the most powerful financial institutions in the world and it works on different projects
protected by patents.
Meanwhile, the technological demand related to the blockchain for the financial services
sector increases at the global level and mostly in developing countries. Various countries
from  Latin  America,  Southeast  Asia  and  Africa  issue  strict  regulations  on  currency
control, and consumers are turning to other solutions rather than to traditional financial
institutions.
In terms of entrepreneurship initiatives, a tendency is emerging since the last couple of
years. Generally speaking, 2015 was the year in which financial institutions and young
financial technologies companies discovered the blockchain. The year 2016 was the one
of pilot projects and of the first deployments. If we follow this tendency, we expect that
2017 will be the year when blockchain commercial solutions will go from pilot projects to
marketing and large-scale adoption
Cryptocurrency  transforms  the  world.  It  will  create  an  unprecedented  positive  social
impact. You may decide to watch the train go by, or you may take part in a historical
moment and support us in this journey.
4.1.  The future
PlexCoin's projects and ideas on short, medium and long terms are ambitious and
bold. Our priority is to make cryptocurrency accessible to everybody. We must
inform  people  on  the  operating  process  of  this  new  technology.  We  also  must
reassure   people   about   publications   found   on   the   Internet   that   scorn
cryptocurrency. Using PlexCoin is as convivial, if not more, than using a traditional
credit card.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                                     21 of 56




Having the possibility to transfer an amount to someone without any delay or fees
or  make  your  daily  purchases  without  depending  on  a  bank  that  controls  your
money by imposing transaction limits and unreasonable fees is the vision of the
future  of  the  financial  world  of  the  PlexCorps  group  and  of  the  PlexCoin
cryptocurrency.
Here are some of the cryptocurrency's main advantages:
1.                                                                                        They are currencies that do not depend on central banks.
2.                                                                                        They  are  created  for  the  Internet.  They  are  tangible  alternatives  to
traditional  payment  systems.  They  allow  increasing  the  accessibility  to
online markets of developing countries.
3.                                                                                        They are transparent. All transactions are public, but the owners and the
recipients  of  these  transactions  are  impossible  to  trace  since  they  own
private addresses.
4.                                                                                        Cryptocurrency  cannot  be  counterfeited  or  misused.  The  encryption
protocol is also intended to resist to an impressive list of computing attacks,
including distributed denial of service attacks.
5.                                                                                        There  are  no  transfer  fees.  Therefore,  these  are  lower  than  those  of
traditional banks and to those of fund transfer companies such as Paypal or
Western Union.
6.                                                                                        Funds are rapidly transferred, in seconds or minutes. Bank transfers
usually confirm in hours or days.
7.                                                                                        Money  transfers  can  be  processed  internationally,  regardless  of  the
country.
8.                                                                                        There is no maximum or minimum amount allowed or required for transfers.
9.                                                                                        There is no intermediary (bank, depositary). The credit is carried directly to
the recipient.
10. Transactions are irreversible. The recipient cannot undergo any transaction
cancellation.
11. Any individual and any company may transfer funds.
12. Cryptocurrency storage is remote, on a server or downloaded on a key.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                              22 of 56




13. The  total  amount  of  money  may  be  capped  for  some  cryptocurrencies,
making this kind of currency deflationary  (the quantity of money can only
decrease over time).
4.2.  Our goal
The PlexCorps group focuses on granting its members the total control over their
finances and offering them the necessary tools to achieve this goal in a completely
safe and decentralized way. Peace of mind based on the confidential management
of  your  finances  is  within  your  reach.  PlexCorps  will  ensure  you,  in  a  timely
manner, an entirely independent way of managing your finances based on the
proper functioning of a bank.
4.3.                                                                                         How are we different?
People who are familiar with ICOs and to company funding will quickly notice that
PlexCorps  do  things  differently.  We  do  not  rely  on  other  ICOs  and  on  their
processes. Of course, we often check out other ICOs in order to be aware of the
available offers and of the new technologies, but we do not copy them. We noted
that some ICOs have identical websites. We even noticed that some images and
some team members presented were the same across different companies  (we
will not name them). We also remarked photographs of totally forged, misleading
persons.
Instead of giving wrong information to secure our members, we set the record
straight and remain transparent on what we deem important to reveal. If for one
reason or another we must narrow down the quantity of information we give away,
we will inform you about it as soon as possible and we will provide you with clear
explanations as to the reason why we are making such decision.
We also are different in terms of proximity to our members. For example, we run a
professional Facebook page, which gathers now more than 70 000 followers from
all over the world.
This is an unprecedented popularity in an ICO. We target the general public, not
only the cryptocurrency experts. We also are very active on our page. A full team
is dedicated to answering your questions. We put into place an online chat service
on our website and we answer emails within 24 hours.
These details make us stand out from other organizations and people talk a lot
about us. Talk about us in a good way or talk about us in a bad way, as long as
you talk about us, everything’s OK!

4.4.   Use of PlexCoin
Those who already know about cryptocurrency have an idea of the different uses
of the PlexCoin. For the novices, here are some of its porpuses:

PlexCoin will be a common currency that might be used anywhere in the world,
without amount limitations, without fees and without delays. You will be the only
one to manage your money. Therefore, you will be the only one to decide what to
do with it.
Cryptocurrency will eventually outpace traditional money. The number of users and
the number of transactions will never stop increasing.

We note an obvious explosion of the cryptocurrency market capitalization since
March 2017, reaching a value of more than 100 billion dollars. The time has come
for change. It is time to make known this new method of payment and of financial
management to everyone.
4.5.   Ethereum technology
Build unstoppable applications
Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that
run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud
or third-party interference.
These  apps  run  on  a  custom  built  blockchain,  a  very  powerful  shared  global
infrastructure  that  can  move  value  around  and  represent  the  ownership  of
property. This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or
promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a
will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet,
all without a middle man or counterparty risk.
On traditional server architectures, every application has to set up its own servers
that run their own code in isolated silos, making data sharing hard. If a single app
is compromised or goes offline, many users and other apps are affected. On a
blockchain, anyone can set up a node that replicates the necessary data for all
nodes to reach an agreement and be compensated by users and app developers.

This allows for the user's data to remain private and apps to be decentralized like
the Internet was supposed to in the first place. (REF: 07)
Smart money, smart wallet
The Ethereum Wallet is a gateway to decentralized applications on the Ethereum
blockchain. It allows you to hold and secure Ethereum and other crypto-assets
built on Ethereum, as well as write, deploy and use smart contracts.
4.6.                                                                                        Why ERC20 Ethereum?
Ethereum is a decentralized exchange protocol allowing for the creation by the
users  of  smart  contracts  thanks  to  a  Turing  complete  language.  These  smart
contracts  rely  on  a  computing  protocol  that  recognizes  the  verification  or  the
application  of  a  mutual  contract.  They  are  deployed  and  available  for  public
consultation on the blockchain.
Ethereum uses a denominated count unit called Ether as the payment method for
these contracts. The corresponding acronym used on exchange platforms is ETH.
Ethereum  is  the  second  decentralized  cryptocurrency  in  importance,  with  a
capitalisation of more than 15 billion euros.
An ERC20 token is no different from any other token, it just happens to comply
with Ethereum’s token standard. Why would Ethereum need a token standard?
Interoperability.  If  all  tokens  created  on  the  Ethereum  network  use  the  same
standard, those tokens will be easily exchangeable and be able to immediately
work with Dapps, that uses the ERC20 standard.
A token is “standardized” when it uses a certain set of functions. If developers are
aware of how a token operates, they can easily integrate it into their projects with a
reduced fear of bugs or errors. If multiple tokens behave similarly, operating the
same functions in the same way, a Dapp can then easily interface with different
sub-currencies.
The ERC20 token standard describes the functions and events that an Ethereum
token contract has to implement.
How does a token contract work? Hereunder is a fragment of a token contract to
demonstrate how it maintains the token balance of Ethereum accounts:

4.7.  PlexCoin token address
The  confirmed  and  verified  PlexCoin  token  can  be  consulted  on  the  official
Etherscan website:
https://etherscan.io/token/0xb3203DB25a01fa7950a860B42b899Ad7Da52DDD6
As shown in the token configuration:
-                                                                                            Total supply: 1,000,000,000 PlexCoin
-                                                                                            Token decimals: 8
It  shows  that  in  a  timely  manner,  there  will  be  more  than  a  billion  PlexCoin
distributed everywhere in the world. From that number, only 400 million will be sold
on the pre-sale. The other 600 million will be distributed as PlexCoin bonuses on
PlexCard purchases.
The PlexCoin will eventually be counted with more than eight numbers after the
comma. The PlexCoin UN will thus read as follows: 1,00000000.
4.8.  PlexCoin smart contract address
The confirmed and verified PlexCoin smart contract can be consulted on the
official Etherscan website:
https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3203DB25a01fa7950a860B42b899Ad7Da52DDD6#code
Our contract was created in the simplest way possible in order to reduce to the
maximum PlexCoin's transactions delays. The simpler the contract, the faster the
process.
We  worked  for  several  days  on  the  contract's  conception  before  it  met  our
simplicity expectations.
Here is our smart contract’s source code:

4.9.                                                                                         Social networks
It  is  important  to  explain  PlexCoin’s  marketing  strategy.  Unlike  other  ICOs,  we
focused our efforts on Facebook.
Our Facebook campaign targeted a total of  1.8 billion people from all over the
world,  every  day  (excluding  the  province  of  Quebec  (Canada)  and  the  United
States).  We  targeted  men  and  women  from  18  years  of  age  to  65  years  old
speaking English and French.
Unlike a Google advertising placement, which only aims at people who research
on cryptocurrency, Facebook targets people who are susceptible to like our page,
thus people who have already seen or read an article on cryptocurrency or who
talked about it with their friends. Our mission is to make PlexCoin known to the
highest number of people possible. Facebook is then our main ally.
An additional strategy used was a simple contest in which we allowed people to
invite their friends to also participate. We then drew a winner for a US$ 5 000.00
cash prize.
Another very successful strategy was referencing for a 5% bonus on purchases.
When subscribing, each member had a unique link that they could share with their
friends and have the chance to get 5% of all the purchases made by the referred
people on the pre-sale, additionally to a 5% bonus on their own purchases.
A few numbers that show Facebook’s potential  (Q1  2017):
-                                                                                            Active users: 1.936 billion
-                                                                                            Active mobile users: 1.74 billion
-                                                                                            Active daily users: 1.28 billion
Therefore, we plan to continue our expansion through Facebook.
During the pre-sale registration campaign, we received numerous requests from
websites that offered us advertising services in exchange for a Bitcoin payment.
Various people criticized the fact that we were not on large ICO websites. Did you
know that they ask for a weekly amount of US$ 5 000.00 to display your company?
We do not think that it is necessary to spend that much money for this purpose.
Once again, we are different.

4.11. PlexCoin, the new Bitcoin?
We already hear that PlexCoin could be the next Bitcoin, which is very flattering. It
is virtually our main goal.
Bitcoin was created in 2009, and it is already getting old. Its mining technology is
not optimized, and the minors have a decreasing interest in the gains they are
generating with it compared to other cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin’s value is considerable because this cryptographic currency is just like gold
to  the  banking  system.  It  is  the  foundation  on  which  other  cryptocurrencies
calculate  their  performance.  When  a  person  buys  or  sells  another  type  of
cryptocurrency, they often go through Bitcoin for the payment, which makes it the
“official” cryptocurrency.
Since  2011, the enthusiasm has rapidly increased, particularly while on the fast
rise  of  the  Bitcoin  price  in  April  2013.  From  2014  on,  a  second  generation  of
cryptocurrencies  surfaced  (Monero,  Ethereum  and  Nxt)  with  new  functionalities
such as stealth addresses, smart contracts, the resort to lateral blockchains or
ones relying on assets like gold.
Nowadays, the representatives of many central banks declared that cryptocurrency
adoption  such  as  Bitcoin  poses  a  significant  challenge  for  the  central  banks’
capacity to influence the credit price for all the economy. They also evaluated that
the growing popularity of commercial cryptocurrencies may influence consumers
and these may lose faith in paper money. Gareth Murphy, a representative from
the American central bank, said "the general use of cryptocurrency would pose a
challenge  for  the  statistics  organizations,  because  it  would  become  difficult  to
gather data on economic activities, these data being used by the governments to
orientate the economy". He warns that cryptocurrencies represent a new challenge
for the control of important functions of the monetary policy and the change policy
of the central banks. (REF: 05)

We are convinced of the potential of PlexCoin and of its products. We truly believe
that it could outpace Bitcoin over the next years. PlexCoin could become the main
exchange cryptocurrency and the most used one in the world.
The only solution to this extravagant ambition is to make ourselves known and for
PlexCoin to be used by the general public. In order to do that, we need PlexCoin to
be user-friendly and highly convenient.
«  Be the game changer!  »

Section 05
Pre-sale (ICO)
This section will inform you of important aspects of the PlexCoin pre-sale, which will be
launched for the registered members on August  5,  2017, at  2:00 p.m. GMT. For the
people who did not register, the official sale will begin on August 7, 2017, at 3:00 p.m.
GMT.
5.1.                                                                                        Why a pre-sale?
An ICO (Initial Coin Offering) pre-sale is an unregulated means of crowdfunding.
Early ICO's were for funding development of new cryptocurrency instruments, but
modern ICOs serve any purpose.
Generally, tokens are sold to raise money, with token existence and behaviour
defined by mathematical contract algorithms. Unlike an initial public offering (IPO),
the token acquisition is not regulated by the government, and may or may not
grant ownership or other rights in the venture.
In order for PlexCoin to become an international phenomenon and for everyone to
talk about it, we had to create a buzz around this pre-sale. The means used to
achieve this goal was the percentage of profit attributed (projection) according to
the sale level (ROI), an unusual method in the ICO market.
The PlexCoin pre-sale will allow collecting US$ 249 500 000.00. These funds will
be used to develop and design PlexCorps’ products. They will also be used to
maintain the market. You will find more details on PlexCorps’ budget at number
5.15 of this white paper.
Therefore, we hope to sell all the available PlexCoin (400 000 000.00 PLX) on the
pre-sale, and thus make our members benefit from this craze.
5.2.  Pre-sale functioning
The pre-sale functioning is very simple. As for all our products, we designed the
system so that it would be easily understandable. ICOs are usually complex, not to
mention their registration process. People often don’t know what to do or how to do
it, and there is usually little to no information on which to rely on. People then give
up the process and just go to the next ICO, which turns out to be as complex as
the previous one. We solved this puzzle for you. Here are the pre-sale steps to
follow:
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                                34 of 56




Registration
To register to the PlexCoin pre-sale, click on the "Registration" tab, accessible via
the  www.plexcoin.com  website  menu  and  enter  an  email  address  in  the
appropriate field.
In  the  following                                                                             15  seconds,  the  registration  management  system  will  send  a
validation message to the member’s email address.
The member must consult the received email and click on the "Confirm my email
address" button for our system to confirm that the emails will be sent to the correct
location.
The system will then ask to provide a password, preferably a complex one so that
nobody can guess it. This password will allow access to the money; it is then
recommended to avoid common ones.
Once this step is finished, the registration process is completed and the member is
on the waiting list.
The purchase time
The system will assign a purchase time according to the member’s position on the
waiting list. In order to avoid overloading our servers, we will grant access to the
pre-sale to 2 000 people per hour. These people are categorized according to the
date  and  time  at  which  they  registered  to  the  pre-sale  in  order  to  respect  the
priority.
The purchase time will be displayed according to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT),
also known as "Hour 0" on the client access. The time and date are displayed at
the top of the client access screen. A countdown will also be displayed. The ladder
will outline the remaining time before the sale period.
The pre-sale
One hour before the exact sale time, a reminder email will be sent. It will explain
the simple procedure to buy PlexCoin. Members must be ready when the moment
comes; they must have their payment method at hand and be connected at the
right time to enjoy the best prices before PlexCoins are all sold at each level.
PlexCoin management
Once  PlexCoin  are  purchased,  the  transaction  will  be  displayed  on  the  client
access. It will be possible to make other transactions after an initial purchase. One
might buy more PlexCoin until they are all sold.
Important tools will be at the reach of the members on the client access. Here are
some of them:
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                                   35 of 56




 The number of available PlexCoin
 The number of buyers
 PlexCoin’s current price
 PlexCoin’s current value
 The wallet’s value
 The detailed transactions list
 Referencing information
 The current sale level
 The pre-sale end date
With this information, the members will have an overall idea of the situation and of
the pre-sale performance.
End of the pre-sale
When  the  pre-sale  ends,  it  will  not  be  possible  to  buy  PlexCoin  from  your
PlexWallet anymore, even if all the PlexCoin are not sold.
The remaining PlexCoin will be added to the wallet that is strictly reserved to the
bonus issued to the PlexCard users.
It will then be possible to transfer PlexCoin in private Ethereum wallets or to leave
them in the PlexWallet while waiting for the official, complete PlexWallet launch, as
of Q4 2017.
5.3    The calculator
On  PlexCoin’s  website,  you  will  find  a  section  called  "Calculator".  This  tool  is
designed to give you an idea of the potential of our cryptocurrency.
The tool will ask you which currency will be used for the PlexCoin purchase. Note
that these currencies are updated every 5 seconds according to the current global
value, to give you the most precise numbers possible.
Once you have chosen a currency, you may use the tool to display the amount that
you wish to spend on PlexCoin. Please keep in mind that this tool relies on the
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                                   36 of 56




possibility that you bought PlexCoin at the price of US$ 0.13 per unit and on the
possibility that the 400 million available PlexCoin are sold during the pre-sale.
The profit percentage decreases considerably at each sale level.
We explain this fact with this passage:
This calculation tool relies on the pricing scale of the first sale level, which will be
activated  on  the  pre-sale  launch                                                         (US$ 0.13  per  unit).  The  evaluated  value
(US$ 1.76 per unit) relies on the possibility that all of the PlexCoin are sold within
the pre-sale period. If this is the case, your initial purchase will be multiplied by
1 354% in 29 days or less. (REF: 06)
You also have the "I want to invest more" option, at the bottom of the calculator. By
clicking on this button, the numbers displayed on the calculator will increase by
x100.
5.4                                                                                          Return on investment
The return on investment (ROI) is the projected gain on your PlexCoin purchase,
considering that you must sell your PlexCoin to receive your money.
Here  are  the  expected  returns  on investment,  relying  on the  possibility  that  all
PlexCoin are sold during the pre-sale:
-                                                                                            Sale level 1: ROI after 29 days or less: 1 354%
-                                                                                            Sale level 2: ROI after 29 days or less: 629%
-                                                                                            Sale level 3: ROI after 29 days or less: 332%
-                                                                                            Sale level 4: ROI after 29 days or less: 200%
                                                                                             These  numbers  might  seem  enormous,  but  they  are  real.  For  comparison
                                                                                             purposes, hereunder are shown some ROI examples from previous ICOs:
-                                                                                            Bitcoin: 1 887.36%
-                                                                                            Ethereum: 7 951.36%
-                                                                                            Ripple: 3 005.48%
-                                                                                            Litecoin: 938.46%
-                                                                                            Dash: 88 736.89%
-                                                                                            Monero: 1 539.95%
We are rather conservative in these comparisons. This information is displayed
only to show to novice people that cryptocurrency's value is ever growing. This
growth  is  principally  generated  by the  craze around  cryptocurrency  and  by  the
products that the companies offer in order to maintain the value of its money.

Please understand that the return on investment relies on the eventuality that all
Pexcoin are sold during the pre-sale. If not, you may consult the value according to
the number of available PlexCoin on our calculation tool.

5.6.  Sale levels
We established four gradual sale levels during the pre-sale:
The first level will be the most popular and will
be  the  one  that  ends  the  fastest.  This  level
offers  the  best  return  on  investment  ever
offered by an ICO.
50 million PlexCoin
sold at US$ 0.13 per unit
ROI: 1 354%
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                           38 of 56




The   second   level   will   automatically   be
activated when level 1 ends. This level is very
interesting   because   of   its   relatively   low
purchase price.
50 million PlexCoin
sold at US$ 0.28 per unit
ROI: 629%
The next sale level offers a very attractive ROI
of 335%. More PlexCoin will be offered on this
level, so it will last longer.
100 million PlexCoin
sold at US$ 0.53 per unit
ROI: 332%
The final level will be your last chance to buy
PlexCoin before the sale ends. This level will
release                                               200  million  PlexCoin  at  less  than
US$ 1.00 per unit.
200 million PlexCoin
sold at US$ 0.88 per unit
ROI: 200%

These sale levels are definitive and cannot be modified since the launch of the pre-
sale registration process.
5.7.                                                                                          PlexCoin price
PlexCoin’s purchase price and its value during pre-sale are two different concepts.
Its value relies on an algorithm that will make it increase at each transaction.
The established base price is US$ 0.13, but its initial value is US$ 0.26. On the
sale  level                                                                                   1,  the  price  will  remain  of  US$ 0.13,  but  the  value  will  always  be
increasing. At every PlexCoin transaction, the value will rise.
There is a tool on the client access that will inform you of the PlexCoin value
during the pre-sale. You can also verify this information on our website, on the sale
levels tab. We displayed a value/quantity graph; you will then be able to hover the
cursor  over  the  graph  to  consult  the  precise  data  according  to  the  number  of
PlexCoin sold.
For  example,  after  we  sell  20  millions  of  them,  the  purchase  price  will  remain
US$ 0.13 per unit, but its unitary value will be of US$ 0.34. Your wallet’s value will
thus increase continuously.
The expected final value after the 400 million PlexCoin are sold is of US$ 1.76 per
unit. This value will remain the same until its market entry on exchange platforms
in September.
We estimate an approximate unitary value of US$ 8.50 before the end of the year
2017, and a value of US$ 14.00 per PlexCoin by the end of 2018.
5.8.  Bonus
In PlexCoin’s business plan, you will find four types of PlexCoin bonuses:
1. Profile bonus
These bonuses are issued when a member answers the questions asked on the
client profile. A total of 5 PlexCoin per answered question will be delivered.
We implemented these bonuses for one simple reason. We want you to live the
PlexCoin client access experience with real transactions since the beginning of
your journey with us. When the pre-sale launches, your bonus PlexCoin’s value
will increase, which will certainly make you want to have more in your account.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                                  40 of 56




2.                                                                                        Reference bonus
This bonus is issued by percentage. Each referred person who subscribes
will be linked to your account as referrer/referred.
The referred person, who became a PlexCoin member thanks to you, will
receive a 5% bonus on each purchase in PlexCoin.
As a referrer, you will also receive the equivalent of 5% on every purchase
made by your referred people during the pre-sale.
3.                                                                                        PlexCard bonus
The PlexCard will offer you bonus PlexCoin on every purchase. There will be
four types of PlexCard:
o   PlexCard Ultimate Member Limited edition
o   PlexCard Platinium Member Limited edition
o   PlexCard Helper Member Limited edition
o   PlexCard Standard
These   cards   will   have   different   characteristics,   explained   in   the
corresponding PlexCard white paper. They will all offer different percentage
bonuses on purchases paid in PlexCoin.
During the pre-sale, at the bottom of the client access, you may verify your
admissibility  to  one  or  another  of  these  cards.  The  Platinium  and  Helper
cards  will  rapidly  be  given  out  since  they  are  both  intended  for  the  first
thousands of people who will buy PlexCoin.
The Ultimate Member card’s list of potential recipients will be updated until
the very end of the pre-sale because it is intended for the 500 people who
will have bought the highest number of PlexCoin. This list is available on the
client access. Are you one of these lucky people? If you are at position 505
of                                                                                        500,  you  will  not  receive  the  Ultimate  Member  card.  If  you  decide  to
purchase more PlexCoin and you now qualify for this card, you will be, for
example, at rank 498 and thus be admissible for the card.
Here are the requirements to meet in order to  receive the limited edition
cards.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                              41 of 56




Ultimate Member
Important buyers
The 500 people who will buy the largest
number  of  PlexCoin  will  receive  the
PlexCard  ULTIMATE  MEMBER  Limited
edition   card,   which   will   offer                                           10%
bonuses  on  every  purchase,  unlimited
withdrawals at ATMs and no fee for life.
Platinium Member
Fast buyers
The 1 000 first buyers (regardless of the
amount   purchased)   will   receive   a
PlexCard PLATINIUM MEMBER Limited
edition   card,   which   will   offer                                           7.5%
bonuses  on  every  purchase,  unlimited
withdrawals   at   ATMs   and   lifetime
reduced fees by 75%.
Helper Member
Helper buyers
The first 2 000 buyers (regardless of the
amount   purchased)   that   will   have
referred  at  least  one  person  with  their
private   referral   link   will   receive   the
PlexCard   HELPER   MEMBER   Limited
edition card, which will offer 5% bonuses
on every purchase and lifetime reduced
fees by 50%.
People who do not qualify for one of these three cards will have the option to
order a standard PlexCard card as of February  15,  2018, from their client
access. Please note that all our cards will be issued on demand, without fees
and without a credit inquiry.
4.  Draw bonus
During our advertising campaigns, we will make several drawings. The
winners will be granted bonus PlexCoin in their personal account.

5.9.  Available PlexCoin number
The total number of available PlexCoin is 1  000  000  000.00.
The total number of PlexCoin on sale is 400  000  000.00.
The total number of PlexCoin exclusively reserved for bonuses is 600  000  000.00.
No additional PlexCoin will be created. When all PlexCoin are issued, there will be
a total of 1  000  000  000.00 PlexCoin in circulation. We configured the PlexCoin so
that it can display up to 8 decimals after the 0. This will be necessary if its value
increases so much that it is possible to buy parts of them (buying 0.005 PlexCoin
or 0.00000008 PlexCoin, as an example).
5.10. How to buy?
The PlexCoin purchase procedure has been simplified to the maximum in order to
respect  our  commitment  to  the  public,  which  is  to  make  cryptocurrency  highly
convenient.
On a regular ICO, a person who desires to buy tokens has to already possess
cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. On the new ICO’s website, you will find a wallet
address, to which you must transfer the desired amount in Bitcoin.
This  transaction  cannot  be  made  from  exchange  platforms  such  as  Poloniex,
Bittrex or Coinbase, but from a private wallet that belongs to you.
Complicated, isn’t it?
One hour before your purchase moment, you will receive an information email from
PlexCoin in order to notify you to get ready to purchase. Once the moment has
come, go to the PlexCoin website and connect to your profile. You will then see, in
the "PlexWallet" section, the "Buy" button, which will be in colour when you will be
allowed to make a purchase.
Click on the "Buy" button. On the next page, you will find the terms and conditions,
which you must read and confirm to agree on by checking two boxes.
You will then be invited to choose between four payment options:
-                                                                                         1.   Credit card
-                                                                                         2.   Bitcoin
-                                                                                         3.   Ethereum
-                                                                                         4.  Litecoin
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                              43 of 56




1.                                                                                            The credit card option requires for you to indicate the amount that you wish to
use (in USD) to buy PlexCoin, in the window at the right of the screen. Once
this step is done, click on the box to confirm that you are the owner of the card
and click on "Continue".
A window will open. It is an external secured application that processes millions
of  transactions  yearly.  It  is  reliable.  You  will have  to  enter  your  credit  card
number and its expiration date in the window.
Once this procedure is completed, you will be redirected to the client access
home page and you will see the new transaction appear.
2.                                                                                            PlexCoin innovates: instead of having only one wallet to receive the Bitcoin
used by its members who buy tokens, it is PlexCoin’s system that will help you
to complete the registration to a private wallet for each cryptocurrency that we
accept as a payment method. This prevents security problems and prevents
hackers from attacking one wallet address where all the money would be.
Buying PlexCoin with Bitcoin is simple. Copy your PlexCoin personal wallet
address  and  transfer  the  desired  number  of  Bitcoin  from  any  exchange
platform. You may use Poloniex, Bittrex, Coinbas and other ones without any
issue.
When  your  Bitcoin  is  in  your  private  PlexCoin  wallet,  our  systems  will
automatically  detect  the  transaction  and  immediately  exchange  the  Bitcoin
value into PlexCoin.
When  you  make  a  Bitcoin  transaction,  once  the  transfer  is  processed,  the
transaction will appear in the transactions list on your client access. It will be
"Pending" until your Bitcoin transaction is confirmed.
3.                                                                                            Ethereum purchases use the same innovation as Bitcoin. The functioning is
identical, but if you interact with a private Ethereum management app, you will
have to indicate an amount in GAZ as well as an amount in GWUI.
o   Suggested GAZ amount: 200  000
o   Suggested GWUI amount: 50
4.                                                                                            The Litecoin purchase process is exactly the same as the Bitcoin one.
5.                                                                                            A fifth option is available. Once again, it is an option that was never offered by
an ICO. A  number of  cryptocurrency ATMs are available in the world, with
which you may deposit money and exchange it for Bitcoin.
Every PlexCoin member has a private Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin private
addresses. This means that when you go to a cryptocurrency automatic teller
machine, instead of scanning your Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin private wallet
QR code, you need to scan the QR code of one of your PlexCoin wallets.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                                  44 of 56




These QR codes are found in the cryptocurrency section of your choice. Copy
the wallet address. You will find a button that will make appear the QR code
linked to your wallet.
This  way,  the  money  you  deposit  will  be  automatically  distributed  in  your
PlexCoin  wallet.  The  system  will  change  the  incoming  cryptocurrency  for
PlexCoin.
5.11. How to sell?
On the client access, at the right of the "Buy" button, you will find the "Sell" button.
When  the  pre-sale  ends,  you  will  have  the  opportunity  to  sell  your  PlexCoin
according to the current value. It will also be possible to transfer them to another
private wallet, which will be a "myetherwallet" and to download your cryptocurrency
on a USB drive.
To sell your PlexCoin from the client access, click on the "Sell" button. The system
will display the following PlexWallet details:
-                                                                                          The number of PlexCoin owned;
-                                                                                          The number of bonus PlexCoin owned;
-                                                                                          The total number of PlexCoin available for sale;
-                                                                                          The current PlexCoin value.
You  may  then  indicate  the  number  of  PlexCoin  that  you  are  selling  in  the
appropriate field. The transaction will be immediate and definitive. It will also be
listed in your transactions display.
The money earned from your PlexCoin sale will be added to your wallet in USD.
From this wallet, you may ask for a withdrawal by direct transfer or you may buy
more PlexCoin.
When you receive your PlexCard, it will be easy to transfer your PlexCoin and/or
your US dollars on it in order to spend your money privately.
5.12. How to transfer?
When  the  PlexWallet  is  officially  launched,  you  may  download  the  mobile
application on the device of your choice  (iOS or Android). You also may install
PlexWallet on a tablet, a PC or a MAC.
The "Transfer" option may be used to transfer your PlexCoin from your PlexWallet
to an external wallet. You may then transfer funds to a friend who is on the other
side of the world or to a family member in seconds and at no cost.

You may also receive transfers from your contacts. It is your money; you should be
able to do whatever you want with it!

sale will be reserved to the "overdraft" mode to conclude dysfunctional
transactions or to solve potential conversion problems. Please note that
this reserve exists for security purposes only and that it is very unlikely
that it becomes necessary.
These four allowances will be transferred onto four different wallets pertaining to
PlexCoin since the very beginning of the pre-sale to secure the amount.

5.14. Amount earned from the PlexCoin pre-sale
According to a simple calculation, here is the expected amount to be earned from
the PlexCoin pre-sale:
Level 1 = 50 million PlexCoin X US$ 0.13 = US$ 6 500 000.00
Level 2 = 50 million PlexCoin X US$ 0.26 = US$ 14 000 000.00
Level 3 = 100 million PlexCoin X US$ 0.53 = US$ 53 000 000.00
Level 4 = 200 million PlexCoin X US$ 0.88 = US$ 176 000 000.00
A total of 400 million PlexCoin sold and US$ 249 500 000.00

The  funds  earned  from  the  PlexCoin  pre-sale  will  be  used  according  to  the  chart.
Regardless of the received amount, the funds will always be used in these proportions.
Our budget structure allows for a large part to be used for the market maintenance. This
will ensure a consistent increase of PlexCoin’s value, even if members sell their assets
massively.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                                    48 of 56




10% - Development
A  budget  of                                                                                    10%  of  the  revenue  will  be  allowed  to  PlexCorps’  future  products
development. This budget will be used to improve the user’s experience and to maintain
it  up-to-date.  The  team  at  PlexCorps  will  design  easy-to-use  and  safe  products  and
applications, in accordance with the main mission of the company.
5% - Security
The financial health of the PlexCoin market relies on its security. We will use every
necessary  and  available  means  to  secure  your  transactions  and  to  protect  our
infrastructures against potential attacks.
5% - Marketing
PlexCoin must be known by everybody. We want to expand more in the underdeveloped
countries that wish to use their own money in a safe way. We also wish to be present in
the world’s biggest cities to outpace Bitcoin.
7% - Operations
To ensure quick and efficient transactions, our networks management team will always
be optimizing our networks and redundancy architectures everywhere in the world for
your transactions to be fast and for our products to remain secure.
3% - Legal
Laws differ from one country to another. PlexCorps needs to ensure compliance with
these laws. Even if our services are decentralized, we need to protect the members that
use our services in countries where laws about cryptocurrency are not clearly dictated.
70% - Market maintenance
The major part of the pre-sale earned funds will be reserved for this use. Our market
maintenance team will remain on the lookout for PlexCoin’s value fluctuations when it
will be launched on the market. The team will limit the value decreases by buying if the
value drops. This part of the budget will also be used to buy member’s PlexCoin on
demand via PlexWallet.
We will thus guarantee a rather steady increase of PlexCoin’s value and will avoid high
price fluctuations in case of mass purchase or sale from our members.

Finances
Our company is taking off and we promote a new business model that offers significant
innovations. This compromises the assessment of the popularity of our products and
complexifies the predictions of the impact of these on the population. Therefore, we
created not one, but two tables of financial forecasts for the next five years. One displays
conservative numbers, and the other displays optimistic numbers.
6.1.                                                                                           Abstract
PlexCorps’ and its products’ revenues will only come from PlexBank, which will be
launched at the end of 2018. We want to reduce to a minimum the fees paid by our
members so we can increase the number of people who use and appreciate our
products and our cryptocurrency to the maximum.
PlexCoin will profit from the PlexCoin sale and from the purchase of these. The
company will then offer this profit to its members after the pre-sale. If clients wish
to buy PlexCoin (if any still available) after the pre-sale, they will pay a price 2%
higher than the current PlexCoin value. A member who wants to sell PlexCoin after
the pre-sale will be able to do it directly with PlexCoin from the client access at a
price 2% lower than the current PlexCoin value.
PlexBank will offer special accounts to the members, with established monthly fees
and  interesting  investment  benefits  thanks  to  our  "freeze  cryptocurrency  value"
service, an option that is not available elsewhere.
From a conservative standpoint, we estimate that, on average, a member who
uses all of PlexCoorps’ services will bring a yearly profit of US$ 1 100 in the fifth
year.
Since  January  2017,  Ethereum  and  the  cryptocurrency  market  increased  their
value of almost 300 000% yearly (6.7 times per three months). We do not believe
that this increase will last for a long time, but the market will stabilize over a few
years.
It  is  time  to  take  advantage  of  the  buzz  around  cryptocurrency  and  to  use  its
services. Do not forget that, at the very beginning, the Bitcoin sold at less than
US$ 0.03 per unit and that now, it sells at more than US$ 3 000: a phenomenal
increase of 10 000 000%.
Hereunder you will find our conservative financial forecast, as well as the optimistic
one, for the five years to come.
PlexCoin (PLX) Whitepaper - © PlexCorps 2017                                                   50 of 56




The major part of the company’s profits will come from the PlexCard purchases.
When members will use their credit card to make a purchase, the PlexCoin system
will "buy" the exact amount of necessary PlexCoin to pay for the transaction in the
currency of the member’s choice. The purchase will be made at the amount of the
current PlexCoin value minus 2%. These PlexCoin will then return on the market,
sold at the current price.
This  2% revenue per transaction ensures great profitability. By proceeding this
way,  we  will  be  able  to  guarantee  a  profit  margin  during  the  pre-sale  to  our
founding members.
The purchase fees are subject to change. They will be reviewed at the PlexCard
launch. The details will be explained in the project’s white paper.
6.2.  Financial forecast - Conservative
To estimate the numbers of the conservative forecast, we considered that 50% of
the PlexCoin would be sold in the pre-sale and that the number of members would
increase by 25% yearly.
                                                                                             Year 1           Year 2            Year 3            Year 4            Year 5

6.3.  Financial forecast - Optimistic
Here  is  the optimistic  forecast.  We considered that  the  totality  of  the PlexCoin
would  be  sold  through  the  pre-sale  and  that  the  number  of  members  would
increase by 230% yearly, for five years. We also added to this hypothesis that all
our projects would be delivered and functional by the established deadlines.
