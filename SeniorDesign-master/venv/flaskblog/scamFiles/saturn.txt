Nothing comes from nowhere and goes to nowhere.
General law of the Universe
Introduction
Today, the status of gold as a standard of value goes into digital field. Bitcoin - digital gold.
Bitcoin is limited in quantity, requires mining costs and is used as payment instrument. The
launch of Bitcoin has led to the emergence of software in the industry based on the
blockchain technology and the emergence of Bitcoin analogs, offering to solve actual
problems or expanding infrastructure for using Bitcoin. Due to the fact that the share value
of the total Bitcoins is estimated at 50% capitalization of a crypto market, others digital
assets are called “Altcoins”, implying "an alternative asset Bitcoin».
The creation of over 2000 altcoins led to the emergence of followers and development of a
speculative market of crypto assets, which can be conditionally divided into 2 types:
• Cryptocurrency is a unit created as a universal payment instrument based on computer
encryption protocol and not controlled by third parties, such as governments and central
banks. Decentralization is an essential sign of cryptocurrency.
• Token is a payment unit created as a payment instrument inside infrastructure
environment of the company, with partially or fully centralized device. Tokens can be
secured and unsecured. Below, we will return to this issue. Sometimes tokens are
compared to stocks of traditional companies.
And the crypto market can be compared with the traditional speculative stock market,
where altcoins are quoted assets and Bitcoin is a quotation asset.
The society is at the beginning of launching a new type of crypto assets - centralized
government cryptocurrencies or digital currencies. In the meantime, Bitcoin continues to
take place as the main cryptocurrency, attracting the attention of traditional capital owners
more and more often.
Due to lack of infrastructure for ordinary consumers who use cryptocurrencies in everyday
purchases, the main value crypto assets - use as speculative instrument. Volatility, the
exchange spread, and sufficient liquidity are necessary to attract the attention of
speculators to any market, and Bitcoin has these three components for speculation.
Problem of the crypto market
The lightning-fast growth of the capitalization of the young crypto market to a value over
800 billion USD was replaced by a tendency of a long fall to values below 200 billion USD.
The total cost of crypto assets decreased by 75%. Some assets have lost up to 90% of the
value, and some are excluded from list of exchanges.
4




During the fall of the market, investors lost about 600 billion USD of their crypto assets. In
a prolonged staying of crypto market on the bottom, the prices of some assets continue to
update the minimum. The owners of such assets gradually lose faith in the market's ability
to grow and begin to get rid of depreciating coins and tokens, aggravating the market
situation. Lack of secondary demand for crypto assets forces teams of blockchain startups,
which were considered hopeful until recently, to turn off any work at their products. With
the complete lack of support for asset liquidity by traders, project founders and exchanges,
these markets are doomed to extinction.
Reasons of the current crisis
The main reason why the market capitalization has fallen by 70% is obviously inflated
capitalization. Due to the peculiarity of calculating the capitalization of crypto markets by
rating providers (Coinmarketcap), the values presented in these ratings are not true.
Capitalization of assets is calculated by multiplying the number of active coins by the
current average market price for one coin. The number of actively circulating coins also
cannot be taken as true, because the number of units of some assets in the hands of just a
few investors reaches 80-90% from all issued coins.
Therefore, these volumes of assets did not generally participate in market trading, and if
they began to participate, they would quickly lower the price of the instrument. Neither
investors nor teams paid for these tokens, and the total lack of secondary demand for such
assets leaves no chances for these markets. As a result of information which
characterizing crypto markets, market-participants are devoid of objective data and are not
able to evaluate the depth of current crisis.
Frozen tokens, being in the hands of project co-founders is one of the main hidden threats
to the crypto market, and the continued falling of secondary demand saves the tendency to
depreciate up to 90% of crypto assets over the next few years. Price decreasing of crypto
assets is market pattern, where the fair cost determines demand, supply, extra value and
non-competitive business model. Asset prices return to true values that for most of crypto
markets equals full depreciation.

Properties required for the markets development
Markets evolves according to economic laws. Each exchange asset to attract money to the
market must have some of qualities, the combination of which attracts or repels investors
and traders.
• Liquidity - the ability of assets to turn into cash. The ability of the market to realize the
demand of investors and speculators, to buy and sell an asset with a volume that matching
with the current market, demand attracts cash to this market. The lack of opportunity to
enter the market with amounts exceeding the current offer is a barrier to increased cash
flow in this market.
• Provision - real assets that provide the value of a trading instrument. The Saturn Black
team is of the opinion that the majority of crypto assets in the existing market are
completely unsecured. Due to the youth of the market and the composition of the traders,
the vast majority unprofessionally trading in this market, companies that issue crypto
assets have attracted large sums of money in cryptocurrencies, promising a future
increase in the price of issued tokens without the presence of real products. In fact, some
projects have been successful, hitting a wave of growing public interest in crypto assets
and their prices increased at the end of 2017 - at the beginning of 2018, like the rise in
prices of market pioneers, Bitcoin, Ethereum and others. According to data that published
by Forbes, at the moment of mid-December 2017, the amount collected by 234 ICO was $
3.7 billion. The first quarter of 2018 was a record for ICO - the volume of funds exceeded
the amount of funds collected by ICO in 2017. But, along with the fall in Bitcoin prices, the
ICO market has also fell down. And the secondary market of crypto assets was not ready
for the influx of so many   trading instruments, the number of which in 2017-2018 increased
by more than 2 times.
• Secondary market. Crypto assets distributed by ICO, needs secondary market and real
using in infrastructure of companies product, offering a token to the market. Due to the
lack of implementation of most blockchain concepts, and often due to the complete lacking
of a real business model, the tokens of such companies follow the path of infinite price
decreasing, up to complete depreciation. And this is not a consequence of malicious
actions by manipulators who organized a long “bear game”. Rather, the fall of the market is
a consequence of the complete unsecured of assets and the lack of secondary demand in
the available markets.
6




• Reliability. Every investor considers an asset like perspective realizing of products
declared by companies, even in cases where the asset used as a speculative instrument
only. Investors evaluate the potential of new markets in attracting trade volumes, through
company communication with the community, advertising or partnerships, and product
introduction into the business infrastructure. In the end, every speculator wants to be sure
that this market will not disappear tomorrow.
• Security. Crypto market is young and belongs to the incipient market. Technology from
time to time give technical security failures. Thefts are not rare in the crypto market, which
negatively affects the development of trading platforms and the value of assets.
• Risk control. In addition to technical safety, we note economic security. Exchange
instruments represented by crypto assets are high-risk, and the majority of traders do not
appreciate the need to fix losses in order to further participate in exchange trading.
Besides, many exchanges are equipped with a weak technical infrastructure that is failing,
which implies more risks.
Money leaves the crypto markets
Today, the market capitalization of cryptocurrency is estimated at about 200 billion USD
(November 2018). Our team believes that even this amount is too high, as mentioned
above. In early January 2018, the capitalization estimate was over 800 billion USD. Where
did the 600 billion USD go to - 75% of the maximum capitalization amount?
Based on the blockchain data, about the distribution of tokens of companies that
conducted crowdfunding fees, we assume that some of the money from the lost 600 billion
USD has never been in this market. The evaluation of the total market capitalization is
conditional, and the transparency of the ICO is usually doubtful. Therefore, no one will
ever know the real numbers and we do not undertake call ratings.
Part of the money received in the form of profits by professional investors ICO, lucky
representatives of the public and traders. Other part of the money invested in crypto
assets went to ICO startups. This money was spent or spent for products development,
paying for employees, advertising or simply wasted. According to published research, up
to 80% of companies that collected money by ICO in 2017, in early autumn 2018 have
already ceased to exist, as teams working on a common product.
View on the near future of bitcoin markets
Studying in practice the crypto markets of different levels of liquidity, the Saturn Black team
hypothesizes:
Further decline expects most of crypto markets. Probably in 5 years, up to 90% of the
trading crypto instruments in the market may disappear, for the following reasons:
• Practical uselessness of technology and competition
• Bankruptcy of companies beneficiaries of assets
• Strengthen government regulations
• Thefts and technical failures
7




Most crypto players believe that the rise of Bitcoin price is inevitable. And since Bitcoin will
go up in price, crypto market in general will also go up. Indeed, such an interconnection is
real and the rise in prices of most of the represented assets is directly related to the growth
of Bitcoin. But, as in any market, the prices of only popular instruments, that attract crypto
players, are rising.
About the cost of Bitcoin, the Saturn team also holds an opinion on the future increase in
the price of Bitcoin. But before, the market is consolidating and relieve the burden of
unsecured trading instruments, that have become obsolete. It will take indefinite time.
In addition, we believe that the crypto market should become safe with the requirements of
international law. Government regulations will coexist with decentralized technologies, for
further scaling of which, the period for determining the legal status of crypto assets should
be completed.
As soon as stabilization processes are completed, a new wave of growth is waiting for the
crypto market.
Manipulators, market-makers, investors and the public
As a rule, most of the trading volume in the market is made up by professional traders,
who are conventionally divided into categories for a deeper understanding of the issue.
• Manipulators - traders or trading bots that affect the price movement of markets in
conditions of low liquidity. They earn on shifting prices to a predetermined range in order to
take profits by closing a trading position.
• Market makers (MM) - traders or trading bots supplying liquidity to the markets by placing
bilateral orders. They earn on the difference of current fluctuations in prices in the range of
prices. Many exchanges provide for remuneration, rebate payments for executed current
orders or fixed fees for fulfilling the conditions of MM contracts.
• Professional investor - a person or company that buys high volume assets in the early
stages of launching trading instruments. In the ICO market, professional investors buy
assets on presale cheaply and sell expensively on rising asset prices. This is a relatively
long-term investment strategy and, depending on the project, where the time from
purchase to sale is several months or even several years, requires adequate capital. A
professional investor, at the same time, often represents two other categories of traders:
manipulators and market makers.
According to our internal research, these three categories of exchange players supply the
market with up to 90% of the trading volume. The remaining trading volume is accounted
for by other categories of players:
• Non-professional investor - a person or a start-up company that has investment funds to
purchase crypto assets during the ICO or the secondary market. In the rising
cryptocurrency market in 2017, earned both professionals and novice investors. The
strategy "buy & hold" brought profit to patient speculators, but only professionals fixed a
profit. So, the representatives of this category were divided and moved into the categories
of professional investors, public or bankrupts.
8




• Public - people or a crowd of people who have watched the growth of the cryptocurrency
market for some time and have decided to invest in the fast-growing market of
cryptocurrencies in order to get quick multiple profits. This category of traders is growing
along with the prices of assets. And also decreases with the market declines, due to the
transition of traders into the category of bankrupts. The transition of public representatives
to the category of professional investors is rare.
Roadmap is the foundation of the Saturn business model
Saturn is a symbiosis of the convenience of direct atomic exchange of crypto assets and
reliability of the third party guarantor. Legal and secure transactions for crypto market
players.
Our purpose: the creation of a qualitatively new, liquid and safe over-the-counter market.
• OTC cross-chain trading
Planned to launch in early December 2108
The OTC Saturn service is oriented to professional investors. The task of Saturn, as a
liquidity operator, is the provision of a two-sided trading volume in the over-the-counter
market, exceeding the average market trading volume, with an increased limit of the
minimum volume of orders. Orders will be partially secured by Saturn assets and direct
P2P orders via the atomic cross-chain protocol on the swap.online protocol.
• OTC auction
Planned to launch in 3Q 2019
Saturn launches an auction of crypto assets of various levels of liquidity. Large lots of
assets attracted by Saturn services on Token Sale will be exhibited at an over-the-counter
auction at the starting market price. Also, it is planned to fulfill orders for sales of large lots
supplied by companies beneficiaries of assets directly. Saturn already allows atomic
exchange from the list of TOP liquid assets: BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, EOS and others. The
list is constantly updated.
• Exchange of atomic trades
It is planned to implement to 4Q 2019
Saturn will launch a P2P exchange on the swap.online protocol. According to analysts, in
the next 15 years, the capitalization of the crypto market will grow to 80 trillion USD. The
demand for crypto assets will continue to grow, as the previous 10 years since the launch
of the decentralized network of digital gold - Bitcoin.
• Transactions with EURO and USD
Partially implemented. It is planned to expand to 4Q 2019 - 1Q 2020
Saturn is working on a fiat currency exchange infrastructure by the atomic exchange, an
over-the-counter cross-chain trade, an over-the-counter auction. It is already possible to
use the exchange of crypto assets for the equivalent of USD - USDT or GUSD. We
continue to work on this exchange direction.

Market Capacity covered by Saturn products
We have already mentioned above that the market has lost 75% of capitalization in less
than a year. The cost of lost capitalization is 600 billion USD.
At the beginning of November 2018, the share of capitalization of the crypto market,
represented by Bitcoin is more than 50%, and the total share of the TOP 10 liquid crypto
assets is another 30%. Together with Bitcoin, the share of the leaders of the crypto market
accounts for 80% or 160 billion USD of the current capitalization amount of 200 billion
USD.
The total share of the rest 2,000 low-liquidity assets is 20% or 40 billion USD - today they
cost so much in the amount of 99.5% of crypto assets. Based on the fact that the market
continues to fall, our team assumes a further decrease in the liquidity of markets and asset
prices, as a result of this process. So, the proposal to exchange low-liquid impaired assets
to the XSAT token with a working infrastructure for the safe trading of multiple crypto
assets will increase the relevance for hundreds of thousands of holders or 99.5% of
market players.
Steps of Saturn on the way to popularizing services
In the development of Saturn's atomic exchange services, the project team is expecting on
the support of the community, which is represented by several million crypto players
around the world.
The listing of crypto assets will depend on the requirements of the community in the
markets and our team will organize regular voting, starting with the first stage of Token
Sale, in order to understand the capacity of the markets and the need to expand the
secondary market.
10




As the volume of assets, attracted to Token Sale in exchange for XSAT tokens is formed,
we will negotiate with representatives of the companies beneficiaries of these assets and
discuss with them the current problems of asset liquidity. Teams of companies interested in
solving the problems of liquidity of assets will receive partnership assistance in the form of
adding assets to the lists of trading instruments. Saturn does not plan to charge additional
fees from companies for delivering liquidity to existing markets and new markets on the
Saturn platform.
Also, services for over-the-counter transactions and an auction will allow holders with high
amount of assets to realize their assets through our platform.
To further popularize the XSAT token and the Saturn platform, the team plans to enter into
popular exchanges. Due to the shift in trading volumes towards decentralization, we
expect to get a fair price for the XSAT token in order to exclude possible manipulations.
As the platform develops, the team intends to conduct a series of research that will help
find new ways in the development of the crypto market and increase the liquidity of assets.
In conducting research, we are expecting on the support of our community, which will allow
us to grow together.
Another step towards popularization is the Primordial Liquidity program. New projects will
receive assistance from the Saturn team. Under this program, projects will receive an audit
of the token model in order to receive adequate feedback and an assessment of the future
token’s liquidity when it reaches the exchanges.
It is planned to popularize the platform through a marketing strategy, using the fund of
bounty program. Moving factors of the product will be the community of crypto players, as
well as the maintenance and development of product quality on our part, according to the
plan to create a new, liquid and safe over-the-counter market.
Competitive advantages
• Reduced risks in comparison with traditional exchanges. Sending crypto assets to
exchange addresses, traders trust the safety of a third party. We will not remind you of the
high-profile cases of hacking exchanges, you probably listened to this, and perhaps
yourself became a victim of hacking. Trusting crypto assets to exchanges, one cannot be
sure that they are 100% safe. The exchanges reserve the right to block funds without
giving reasons, sometimes freeze withdrawals and sometimes close. Making transactions
through the Swap protocol, players do not send crypto assets to the exchange. Coins
remain in the client's wallet until the terms of the transaction are met by the counterparty.
Increased security is the fundamental difference the Saturn approach to making deals.
• Speed. Saturn, due to the particularity of the software architecture, is as fast as allow the
blockchains of the exchanged assets and the internet connection. If we consider the
stages of the deposit and withdrawal of assets for the example of Ethereum, on the
traditional crypto-exchange, that's what we get:
A crypto player transfers an asset from his wallet to an exchange wallet.. The standard
amount of confirmations that the exchange expects before depositing an account is 30. It
takes 300 seconds or 5 minutes.
11




In backwards, the withdrawal will take less time, since Ethereum will arrive on the client’s
personal wallet after 1 confirmation or 10 seconds from the moment of sending. Of course,
provided that the transaction will not be verified by the exchange, and without taking into
account the time for confirmation by e-mail and 2FA. The exchanges delay the payment for
additional verification, if the volume of the withdrawals is more than the established by the
terms and conditions or other rules.
We got the time that players spend on entering and withdrawing on the traditional
exchange - 5 minutes 10 seconds, under ideal circumstances. In practice, this time will be
longer.
Now consider the asset flow on the Saturn platform. Sending Ethereum to the acceptance
party of the transaction, the client will spend the time, required to confirm the network - 10
seconds. This time is final, that the client will spend on the transaction.
Comparing the obtained numbers, we have a 31-fold superiority of speed of the Saturn
platform. In arbitrage transactions where speed is important, our products many times
superior to traditional crypto exchange platforms.
• The reward system for the maker and the referral program is the attractive feature of
trading on the Saturn platform. Since our product was developed by traders and primarily
for traders, we understand how difficult it is to attract assets for trading to a new platform.
Being in the circumstances of a shortage of liquidity, to draw attention to the new
exchange product, possibly by high-quality implementation and reward program of loyal
customers.
It is planned to implement a full-fledged reward program for a maker, depending on the
volume of transactions for the billing period and a system of invitation links, which implies
a reward for the traded volume by invited registered customers.
• Markets are divided according to the exchange specifics and transaction volumes. In
addition to creating a traditional crypto exchange, the release of which is planned to be the
last item on our roadmap, the Saturn team intends first of all to launch services for major
players, investors and payment providers in cryptocurrencies. Having studied the specifics
of transactions for different volumes, we identified over-the-counter exchange services, in
view of the growing demand for crypto assets from professional investors. Increasingly
popular derivative trading instruments based on quotes of crypto assets, such as Bitcoin,
increase the market demand for secured futures assets. The objectives of Saturn in this
process are to ensure direct contact between the seller and the buyer and ensure the
security of the transaction in automatic mode while preserving the anonymity of the
parties.
Saturn’s Profit
Initially, the Swap protocol was created for atomic exchange only with the commissions of
blockchain transactions. In the Saturn services there will be an additional commission,
which will be up to 0.2% for exchange transactions, 0.5 - 5% for over-the-counter
transactions and 1 - 5% for auction transactions. The final commission terms will be
approved by the time of the launch Saturn's releases in accordance with the roadmap.
Also, for several assets, our company will independently deliver two-way liquidity, making
a profit in the form of price spreads.
12




XSAT Token as a standard for liquidity
An important role in the infrastructure and business model of Saturn, is assigned to the
XSAT token. The global task of our team is to achieve token liquidity, including the use of a
token as a payment instrument with the ability to instantly exchange for goods.
XSAT will be used as a quotation asset in Saturn services: exchange and over-the-counter
transactions, auction and escrow.
Also, the project team is working on a model for using the XSAT token as a collateral
asset. But talking about it is premature.
Atomic exchange protocol Swap for crypto assets
The direct atomic exchange protocol allows for the exchange of crypto assets, initially
incompatible blockchains, without the participation of a third party. For example, through
an atomic transaction, it is possible to exchange Bitcoin for Litecoin directly from wallets.
Swap exchange protocol guarantees mutual execution of the transaction by the parties or
cancellation of this transaction if the bilateral terms of the transaction are not fulfilled.
In our example, Bill has Bitcoin, and Sarah has a XSAT token. Let's say, Bill wants to buy
an XSAT token from Sarah, and Sara is ready to sell it for Bill's Bitcoin. Through the Swap
protocol, Bill and Sarah make a transaction, receiving a counter asset, provided each of
them fulfills the terms of the transaction. If the terms are not fulfilled unilaterally, nothing
happens and more importantly, the loss of the crypto asset that was planned for the
exchange does not occur. The exchange described in the example is already implemented
in the Swap protocol.
13




Liquidity of Saturn exchange services and XSAT token
Another reason for the current fall in prices of crypto assets, we believe the final leaving of
players from "dying" markets. This means that players sell crypto assets without a
repurchase goal. The lack of counter purchasing demand makes falling the most likely
scenario for such markets. Inaction or intentional insider actions of project teams make a
situation hopeless. The stuck volumes of assets helds by large investors will lead to a
further fall in prices as soon as investors decide to fix their losses. And it is a matter of
time.
The idea of the Saturn team is to solve the problem of secondary demand by delivering
liquidity to less liquid markets.
Implementing this concept, Saturn launches services for transactions with crypto assets.
XSAT Token is the main quotation asset of our exchange services. The feature of Saturn is
that adding quotation assets to the listing is simplified by determination the assets claimed
by players through voting. The Saturn community is the main mover of liquidity on the
platform. We take into account on reliable demand coming from our customers, as
opposed to paid listings that are popular in the market today. We constantly emphasize the
need for counter purchasing demand in the secondary market and intend to ensure
purchasing demand in the maximum number of trading pairs with XSAT, BTC, ETH and
stablecoins. The basic deposit necessary to maintain the liquidity and profitability of our
services, we plan to allocate at least 50% of the funds collected by the Token Sale.
By listing the XSAT token on public crypto exchanges, we intend to reduce the impact of
Saturn services to the price of the token. For example, the trading volume of the BNB
token is 90% circulated inside the Binance exchange; KCS is 100% inside the Kucoin
exchange. As we think, to establish a fair price, the distribution of the trading volume
cannot be so centralized. To do this, we try to get into the lists of instruments traded in
popular exchanges, as our community grows.
Every Bitcoin in the secondary market is bought for traditional fiat currencies, which still
remain a link between the value of cryptocurrency and goods. We believe that this
situation will not change quickly, so we intend to integrate the easy exchange of crypto
assets for fiat money. Inside the Saturn platform, the exchange is implemented in pairs
with several stablockcoins that can already be used.
To understand this concept, let's consider an analogy.
Saturn’s Digital Alchemy
Compared to Alchemy, the basic task of which was to turn base metals into gold, our team
made up a formula for converting low liquidity assets into high liquidity assets. In the end,
the goal of the experiment is getting the Gold - Bitcoin. If we consider a single market with
all the available trading pairs, then exchange trading is the interaction of 2 or more
substances - crypto assets, which react - exchange between holders of a quoted and
quotation asset. Two assets interact with other assets in all trading pairs available for the
instrument. To imagine how the movement of crypto assets occurs, we tried to show it in
the form of a scheme.
14




In Alchemy there were 12 processes of interaction of substances. Our team identified 4
types of reactions that interest exchange-players: multiplication, filtration, projection and
fixation. Visually, it looks like the movement of the assets shown in the scheme below,
where N is any less liquid asset.
15




The purpose of the transformation of the low liquidity assets is to get profit in the liquid
assets that we receive at the output: Bitcoin, Ethereum and others.
Regarding the trade in low liquid crypto assets, we follow the strategy of increasing the
liquidity of the instrument and gradually reducing the volume of the asset, depending on
the current conditions of a particular market.
The primary task in converting Saturn's asset portfolio is to minimize losses. The Saturn
team understands the impossibility of completely exclusion of losses in the liquidation of
volumes of problem positions. Crypto players have lost 600 billion USD, and the crypto
market has lost ~ 75% of capitalization in less than a year. It means that the loss of the
portfolio value by cheapening of a part of the assets cannot be avoided by our team either.
While aggravating the collapse of crypto markets, we know our strategic position -
stabilizing the value of a portfolio and allocating part of the value to fiat currencies.
Ultimately, crypto players take profits in fiat, so this is a reasonable method.
The first factor that will minimize losses is time. No one in our team predicts the exact date
for the complete transformation of the portfolio of assets attracted from Token Sale.
Moreover, in some markets we will succeed in supplying liquidity and will work with these
assets for months and years. Considering that 51% of attracted assets will provide liquidity
of Saturn services, listing on the platform can notably affect to the trading situation. We are
optimistic about the possible development of markets that will join Saturn through the
efforts of teams and communities.
The second factor that reduces the risk of possible losses is the process of trading on
exchanges. The fact is that by keeping assets under the “buy & hold” strategy, investors
reduce the already low liquidity. As opposed to long-term investors, Saturn implements the
concept of implying trading, rather than asset holding. As a result of a large number of
operations, we expect an increase in holdings of assets in times of falls and a decrease in
rebounds of positions. Markets where the deals are occur do not fall forever. Finally, the
fall stops and the price stabilizes. Otherwise, the market is “dying”.
Assuming probability of complete depreciation of certain positions in our portfolio, we
understand that we will have to take losses. Managing a portfolio of crisis assets is not the
main direction of business models Saturn. In the development of the company's services,
the attracted assets will become a resource for the development of the company's
products declared in the Saturn Roadmap.
Significance of arbitration in establishing a fair price
Exchange arbitrage is a prerequisite in setting a fair price. The emergence of arbitration
gaps is a sign of low liquidity. When more volumes are traded in the market, then there are
fewer arbitration gaps. Saturn platform is the arbiter in the crypto market.
Low liquid assets are usually limited by the number of participating players due to the
small number of trading platforms where the asset is located. Listing in a popular crypto
exchange will cost the company up to several hundred thousand US dollars. Few
companies are ready for such expenses. Markets are not able to develop due to the
limited number of players and the pressure of sales of ICO members. Volumes are falling,
the price is falling, the interest of traders is falling.

Analyzing the collected information in the amount set forth above, we believe that the
addition of new secondary markets will positively affect the assets traded in the Saturn
lists. Fast, secure transactions on our platform are made directly from wallets through the
browser. Reducing the risk of losing money will attract players who appreciate time and
crypto assets. Adding a large number of markets will set in motion countless frozen crypto
assets in investor’s ICO accounts. As a result of this, our team expects to see an increase
in liquidity and redistribution of crypto assets among new players in the new exchange.

XSAT tokens that were not implemented on Token Sale
The remaining part of XSAT tokens on the original wallet after closing Token Sale will be
used:
• to provide additional liquidity and support purchasing demand inside Saturn services
• distributed by airdrop among investors
• partially burned
The final decision about function of unallocated tokens will be made by the Saturn team
after the closure of the Public sale of tokens at Token Sale.
Maximum and planned capitalization
The maximum capitalization planned to be collected at Token Sale will be no more than
93.75 million USD, subject to the sale of all XSAT tokens reserved for Public sale at a
maximum price of 0.125 USD per 1 XSAT. Taking into account the partial sale of XSAT
tokens in the preliminary stages of Token Sale and the possible incomplete sale of 750
million XSAT, the final capitalization may be lower than 93.75 million USD. The company
reserves the right to change the price of the token at any stage of Token Sale, as well as
the period of the stage, but only before the start of the sale stage.
Law
Like many crypto enthusiasts, members of our team appreciate decentralized technologies
and are aware of their importance, not only in the economic, but also in the general
evolutionary process of humanity. But also, we understand the impossibility of
decentralization of the economic component of society alone. The decentralization of the
methods of exchange of value cannot fully function, in conditions of centralization of
authority and settlement of civil and other legal issues. Perhaps sometime, society will
come to decentralization and these integral methods of regulating human relationships. In
this regard, we do not make predictions and intend to conduct the company's activities in a
centralized legal region, currently the Czech Republic. We continue to investigate all
available jurisdictions that can ensure the legitimacy of our services in the future.
We continue to make inquiries about all available jurisdictions that can ensure the legality
of our services in the future.

announced products, launch, popularization and support for the period of achieving self-
repayment. Integration Swap protocol, OCT auction and exchange.

than they had, and work with them will lose meaning, according to the speculative point of
view. Such assets will be removed from the market by burning or using for experimental
purposes by developers.

will be sent by us to the markets and presented at the OTC auction after the launch
planned for the first 2 months after the completion of Token Sale.
Conclusion
While this material was being prepared, the indexes that formed the basis of the
calculations could have changed, and we do not know what changes will come tomorrow.
The market is a living organism, where each player affects the overall condition. Markets
are cyclical, it has always been like that and it will be like that. Growth is caused by
purchases, and falling - sales.
The exchanges are moving into digital area and most of the modern market-players did not
stand in the trading halls, where the atmosphere of excitement drives people, eager to get
rich. But, as before, behind the quoted numerals, the same players are hidden, who are
driven by excitement and dreams.
The fall observed in the market of crypto assets does not differ in something new - all
markets, without exception, are subject to cyclicality. But perhaps one change can not be
ignored - Bitcoin. Value will never be the same again.
What usually considered as money is subject to inflation and a change of owners. Cash
can be counterfeit, and digital bank money is created indefinitely, until inflation devalues
their value. It doesn’t matter, we are talking about the dollar or pound - money loses its
purchasing ability. Leaders change and replace one money with another.
Bitcoin is protected from inflation, falsification and change of owners. It belongs to the
person to whom the keys are available. The path, made by Bitcoin for 10 years, delights
millions of people, and its real popularity has not yet come. Players of the crypto market,
more than once, with bated breath, will observe the ups and downs of the Bitcoin price.

Written above is the opinion of our team, which may differ from others. While reading
White Paper, it will seem to someone that we are terrible pessimists, but this is not true.
We are full of optimism, otherwise we would not do what we do. We believe that Bitcoin
will be used further by people and will be appreciated both by professional speculators and
people who are just used to keeping their value in their own hands.
It is not yet possible to say the same about the altcoin markets, and the crypto assets
represented in the markets, which are popular today, will become the "dead" numerals
saved in the blockchain.
People love to believe in the best and the exchange is the place where dreams unite
players in the struggle for profit, the winner in which will be the fastest and far-sighted. A
dream forces you to buy and it also forces you to hold in your hands assets that lose value
day by day.
Perhaps the day will come when the dreams of the owners of all crypto assets will come
true. But the mind suggests that for most owners of crypto coins and tokens such a day
will never come. We, the Saturn team, were not used to waiting for a dream with folded
arms.
The Saturn platform was conceived as a new safe and healthy trading atmosphere. We
will be glad to personal participation of everyone, as we create this atmosphere for the
players, like ourselves.
