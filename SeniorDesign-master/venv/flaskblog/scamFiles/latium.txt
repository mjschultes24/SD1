What Is Latium?
02
Latium is the first and only tasking platform to incorporate a totally
automated rating system in tandem with a one-to-many task relationship
structure. This will allow a user to create a task for which they can hire one
person, or many thousands of people, to complete the task. This all occurs
within a trustless environment where all participants have transparency in
whom they are working with. The platform will support both “Digital” and
“In-Person” tasks. The Latium team has also designed proprietary task proof
systems for both “Digital” and “In-Person” tasks, in order to remove trust
from the equation while creating an environment where tasks with multiple
contracts can be easily managed. In the case of a “Digital” task, imagine a
user wishes to drive traffic to an online petition. By posting one simple
Latium task, they can send as many people to the petition page as their
budget allows.
Now, let’s look at an example of an “In-Person” task. Imagine a user is
promoting a grand opening for a new restaurant. They post a new task with
the details of the event and then approve applicants that wish to show up for
a reward. As the applicants show up they must all scan either a printed QR
code, scan a code on the task creator’s phone or stay within a certain GPS
location for a certain amount of time in order to check-in to the event. Once
the event is complete, they will scan an additional code to release payment
for the task or auto release based on GPS. "In-Person" multi-contract tasks
can be used for marketing events such as this, or even political or
community driven projects.
The LatiumX (LATX) ERC20 token will be the established form of payment on
the platform. Payment for tasks completed on the Latium platform will be
credited in real-time using LATX, meaning the LATX tokens will have to be
purchased by employers in order to create new tasks in the system.
The Latium platform provides solutions to existing real world problems,
while also improving existing solutions for certain use cases.
1. Lack Of Real World Adoption Of Crypto Currencies
Although the world has become more aware of crypto currencies over the
last 12 months, there is still a very real issue of global adoption. We believe
this is directly related to a substantial barrier to entry in acquiring crypto
currencies and the lack of acceptance as a viable method of tender.
The Latium platform solves these issues by creating an easy to use market
place where anyone willing to complete a task is rewarded with LATX tokens.
LATX can also be used for task creation, meaning that anyone needing a task
completed can now use LATX to pay for the labor. This provides an
opportunity for everyone to join the crypto sphere by simply paying for work
or working for pay.
2. Lack Of Transparent Global Labor Market
Currently labor markets are divided into pools based on Local, Regional and
National regulations. These segmented pools of labor liquidity hurt both
employees and employers alike. As an employee it could be hard to find
work and a livable wage depending on your jurisdiction. As an employer it
can be difficult, or impossible, to find the right employee with the required
skill set in your local labor market.
Now you can apply for any task globally, determine what you are willing to
complete the task for and have transparency in to every facet prior to
acceptance. As an employer you can award the task to the tasker of your
choice and know that if the task is not completed to your standards that you
don’t have to pay.
3. Lack Of Global Reputation System For Global Labor Force
Employers and employees both have had to share a substantial pain point in
the hiring/applying process. Neither party really knows if they are a good fit
for each other prior to working on a task together. Employers can check
references from previous employers, run background checks, etc., while
prospective employees take to internet forums to read posts from previous
employees in order to gain some insight into whether or not this relationship
would be a good fit for them.
By implementing a global reputation system, the Latium platform makes
the employer-employee relationship more transparent from the beginning.
Market Need
03
4. Lack Of Fast Payment System For Global Labor Force
There are many payment systems used around the globe, but most
payments made for completing a task are not even remotely close to
real-time. Some users might wait weeks after a task is completed in order to
receive payment.
The Latium platform issues all payments via LATX tokens, thus creating a
real-time payment network within the platform itself. These tokens can be
withdrawn as soon as the task maker marks the job complete. Task makers
are incentivized to release the payment quickly as it is part of their global
5. True Market Demand For Crypto Currencies
Currently, using a crypto currency as tender is still quite limited. There is a
great desire among crypto enthusiasts to see mass adoption of crypto as a
general payment method. It has become clear however, that in order for this
to occur these tokens must power systems that have real world value for
people.
Latium addresses this issue by creating a real economy for LATX. LATX is the
fuel required by the platform to operate. The activity of buying or selling
tokens should be closely correlated to the platform use and not based on
market speculation.

taskers and task makers have a reputation score. This allows both parties to

impacts a user’s score positively or negatively. Users gain long term
reputations making them more attractive while discouraging the creation of
new user profiles and spam.

Client Facing Applications for iOS, Android and web including:
Features
Clients will be given the ability to create tasks, select the desired applicant and verify the
task is completed to their standards. A nominal service fee will be charged after a task is
completed.
Whether you use amazon.com, Freelancer or Twitter user/product ratings are a big part of
our day to day life. The issue with most rating systems is they require a lot of additional
work to debunk what is true and what is not. Users have to figure out if a reviewer can be
trusted. This takes time and effort. Even after this process you have to question if the
review is truly legitimate, due to the large amount of fake users and pay for review systems
on the net.
A study published by CNBC revealed at least 48 million twitter accounts were fake/bots
(https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/10/nearly-48-million-twitter-accounts-could-be-bots-says
-study.html). We believe the problem is actually much larger than the stated amount and
the issue is certainly not limited to just Twitter. Paid reviews are a big business and has
incentivized the growth of huge review farms around the world. Users are catching on to
this trend that nothing can be trusted and now have to research the reviewer. The
problem is all this extra due diligence creates extra work for the end user.
Latium’s proprietary reputation system takes human opinion out of the equation by
creating a concise and automated system. User scores range from 0-1000 and are based
on many different data points that are systematic, not opinion based. These include, but
are not limited to, amount of jobs completed, hire rate, payment time, task value, and
worker/employer diversity.
The goal is to provide users a simple single number, so they can evaluate quickly without
additional research. This system will start as a proprietary algorithm and over time be
totally AI driven. The best example of this is the US FICO credit score system. Users scores
will change based on actions and also lack of action. Ultimately the AI will create new rule
sets to mitigate risks before they even present themselves, thus creating a reputation
Posting Tasks
Reputation System
Clients can apply for tasks, upload task related documents and files, mark tasks
completed and request payment.
Performing Tasks
Latium’s proprietary physical task locator is designed to make it both fun and easy to
locate paying tasks. The platform presents a map to users with available local tasks which
they complete. By walking or driving around, completing tasks and collecting LATX, the
Latium platform provides a level of gamification (think Pokemon Go, but instead of
finding Pokemon you are collecting LATX). We will also provide standard search filters and
list view for those who want a more business like appearance. Tasks can be confirmed by
scanning QR codes or by staying within defined GPS coordinates for a certain amount of
time. This depends on the task and the settings selected by the task creator.
Physical Task System
05
Latium will include two payment transfer options. One will be an internal system that is
real time and does not require confirmations from miners and will be 100% free.
The other will be blockchain based and require miner confirmation. We are still evaluating
if we will use a state chain for these transfers to help mitigate the gas cost of transacting
on chain.
This feature allows users to work together for a common goal. Group projects could be
something as small as two or three users working together or something very large
requiring hundreds of users to work together.
Group Projects can be used for one to many, many to one and many to many
relationships. This makes the system flexible and able to handle any task required.
Latium Transfer System
Group Projects
User will have editable profiles with avatars, bios and additional information. This allows
both task makers and task doers to get a view into who they are potentially working with.
Profile Management
Both a general chat and task related chat will be made available to all clients.
Chat System
Referrers will make a commission off of referred users. They will also have access to
metrics and reporting. All commissions will be paid in LATX.
Referral Program
The Task Search System provides users the opportunity to find specific tasks which
coincide with their abilities.
Task Search System
The Latium system will be maintained by a nominal per-task fee. These fees will be paid by
the task creator at the time of acceptance. The system will be feeless for a promotional
period until the management team feels market penetration has been achieved.
Revenue created by the fee system will be used for operation expenses and eventually to
incentivize task validators (miners) on our own blockchain. The sole method for payment
of fees will always be LATX.

Future Developments
Due to the current limitations of blockchain technology (mainly latency and query issues)
Latium is being built using a hybrid of distributed, dedicated multi datacenter servers and
blockchain technology. We believe this is currently the only way to deliver an enterprise
class application with a competitive end user experience.
Once the hybrid system is in production, our focus will change to migrating system by
system into the blockchain, with the goal being for Latium to be 100% dependent on
blockchain technology. This task is no small feat, but in doing this we pave the way for
other enterprise applications to be 100% blockchain dependent. Through this process
other revenue models, such as licensing proprietary Blockchain DB, file storage, CDN and
hosting technologies, will present themselves. All of these will add another layer of value
for LATX holders.
Migration To A Full Blockchain System
Once the platform is in production and stable, part of the team will focus on incorporating
other methods of payment outside of just LATX, including fiat and other dominant crypto.
Fees will always be required in LATX, similar to how Ethereum Gas functions, no matter
what other currencies we accept.
Introduction Of Other Crypto Currencies And Fiat Into The
Latium System
08
Ease of access to LATX and other currencies is imperative for mass adoption. Users require
easy access to buy and/or sell LATX. The platform will allow for easy exchange via API
connections with existing exchanges and/or using Shapeshift.io. The goal is to allow
purchases via credit cards and in real-time making it easy to participate in the system.
Allowing users to withdraw profits in fiat will also facilitate usability. Users can hold their
earnings in LATX or convert on the fly and receive funds via PayPal.
On-The-Fly Conversion Functions
09
Funding Breakdown
Minimum project funding was achieved in the presale phase. A total of 100,730,550 LATX
was sold in the presale. Presale rate was fixed at 10,000 LATX per Ether.
Presale
The general sale will open on November 28th, 2017. The general sale will be comprised of a
tiering structure until the end of the sale. Tiers will end on certain dates unless the allocation sells out before the end date. The general sale rate will be priced in USD and will
increase as each tier ends. The tiers are priced in USD and the first tier is priced at $0.08 per
LATX. The total max cap of ETH raised from the Whitelist Sale and the General Sale is $15
Million USD. The general sale will end on or before March 1st, 2018. Any token sale supply
not sold during the general sale will be burned.
General Sale
General Sale Tier Structure
The whitelist sale opened on November 15th, 2017 and closed on November 28th, 2017.
Rates were static during this period at 9,000 LATX per Ether. The whitelist was a limited
sale open to users whose applications were accepted by the team. Anyone could apply,
but only a select number of applicants were chosen to participate in this sale. The amount
of tokens sold in this phase will be released at the close of the entire sale. The goal of the
whitelisting process was to ensure diverse token distribution and help mitigate market risk
imposed by single large token holders.

Funds raised during the token sale will be used for the development and maintenance of
the Latium system. Although much of the planning and a decent amount of the
development work has already been done to prove the proof of concept at the
shareholders expense, we understand the task laid before us to get mass adoption of the
Latium platform requires greater funding than we currently have. Funds will be allocated
to allow for an 18 month runway in a less volatile currency such as USD, EUR, GBP or CHF.
This helps protect the project from massive market swings and ensures this project is
brought to production as soon as possible without market risk.

These funds will be allocated to both the existing core team and also to recruit new
developers to help bring the Latium system to market. The stakeholders plan to allocate
no less than 25% of these funds to a recruitment process open to the community. This will
allow the community to have a say in who is added to the team. This system will be
available at Latium.org shortly after the end of the token sale.
30% Marketing
We acknowledge that in order for the Latium system to get mass adoption we need to
place a large focus on market exposure. With this is mind, we have allocated a large
portion of funds received towards marketing. Marketing strategies will include, but are not
limited to, affiliate marketing, online campaigns, CPA campaigns and gorilla marketing.
10% Operations
Day to Day operations will consist of admin, HR and operations staff. These funds will be
used to ensure a smooth operation and as growth starts that we have the required
manpower to keep up with demand.
15% Security
The stakeholders acknowledge that security is paramount for any crypto based product.
We plan to use this portion of funds to reward bug bounties, host a hackathon and to
secure outside security audits.
5% Legal
These funds will be used for legal review of all service agreements, terms and privacy
policies. We also use a portion of these funds for any potential jurisdictional reviews
required.

Overview Of Token Structure
180,000,000 LATX tokens (60% of total Supply) available during all phases of the token sale.
Any tokens not sold during this period will be burned.
Token Allocation
12
Platform Adoption Incentives
60,000,000 LATX tokens (20% of total supply) will be used for promotion once the
Latium platform is in production. These tokens will provide incentives to sign up
and use the Latium platform during the ramp up of production. New users will be
allocated a certain amount of tokens to use within the Latium Ecosystem (cannot
be withdrawn but can be spent on task creation). These 60 million tokens will be
held in a lockup contract and released, according to the schedule below, for use in
the system.
After release, these funds will be held in a single contract. The only function of this
contract will be to release tokens to platform users and will be made available for
public inspection prior to the first token release in order to ensure transparency.
The below schedule is the maximum that can be withdrawn on a given date. The
amount of the withdrawal will be determined at the time of release up to the
maximum allowed by the lockup contract. The amount withdrawn will be solely up
to the management team and based on project requirements at the time of
release. This contract has been made available on Github for public review and

contract for 12 months releasing on November 1st 2018. These funds will be used to
expand the management team after production release in key areas and founder’s
equity. This amount is the maximum amount that can be withdrawn from the
Lockup contract. The amounts actually withdrawn will be left up to the founders to
decide up to the maximum allowed by the contract. This contract has been made
available on Github for public review.
Bounty Program
15,000,000 LATX (5% of total supply) will be allocated for bounty programs. The
following programs are included in this allocation Wings (1% of total supply),
General Affiliate System (up to 2.6% of total supply), General Bounty (1% of total
supply) for bitcointalk members, Marketing Bounty (0.4% of total supply), such as
promotional programs, Banner ads for 3rd party sites. The Marketing Bounty is an
additional bounty campaign, not a guaranteed distribution and will be up to the
management team who can receive this bounty. To apply for the Marketing
bounty campaign, please, contact support@latium.org
All purchases of LATX should be for the sole purpose of use within the platform. This is not an offer for investment or a
security. If you are looking to purchase the LATX token with a purpose other than usage within the platform you should
reconsider your purchase.

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR LEGAL, FINANCIAL, TAX,
OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISOR BEFORE TAKING ANY ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
TOKEN SALE
Participation in a token sale can be highly speculative and could involve a risk of loss.
Prospective token purchasers should not construe this Website or White Paper or any disclosures or
disclaimers contained therein as a source of legal or tax advice. The White Paper currently contains a fair
summary of Latium Network Inc.'s vision and the operation and utility of its token, and is subject to changes as
the matters or relevant importance evolve. Further, this Website or White Paper does not constitute the
offering of a security.
We have consulted and continue to work with legal counsel to assess the possible regulatory treatment by the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission in light of the developing regulatory guidance. Presently,
the primary method for determining whether a particular instrument should be characterized as a security
under United States securities laws was promulgated by the United States Supreme Court in SEC v. W.J.
Howey, 328 U.S. 293 (1946), providing for what has become known as a Howey test. According to the Howey
test, an instrument is a security if the following four factors are satisfied: (1) an investment of money, (2) in
common enterprise, (3) with an expectation of profits, (4) solely from the efforts of others.
The SEC did not take the position as to whether virtual currencies, or interests in such currencies, are
themselves securities, instead indicating that it will apply the same framework that the SEC and courts have
applied thus far. On July 25, 2017, the SEC Division of Enforcement issued an investigative report involving
tokens issued by The DAO, a virtual organization. The biggest takeaway from this investigative report is that
tokens that function like investment contracts under the Howey test will be treated as securities. Although the
courts in the United States have not yet directly applied the Howey test to any digital currency or blockchain
token, Latium Network Inc. and its counsel have conducted an analysis under the Howey test, and continues
to do so, with the conclusion that, in all likelihood, Latium does not pose a significant risk of implicating federal
securities laws. In light of this, and absent any contrary conclusions or findings, Latium tokens have not and will
not be registered or filed under the securities laws or regulations of the United States.
Notwithstanding the conducted research, analysis, and due diligence, the regulatory status of cryptographic
tokens, digital assets and blockchain technology is a young industry, varies significantly among jurisdictions,
and is thus subject to significant uncertainty. Due to this uncertainty and the general nature of the rapidly
changing regulatory landscape, there is always a risk that Latium tokens may not be exempt from securities
registration requirements in the United States. Latium Network Inc.'s representations and securities
assessments are not a guarantee that the SEC or any other regulatory authority will not determine the tokens
to be securities subject to registration. It is possible that certain jurisdictions, whether state or federal, domestic
or foreign, may adopt laws, regulations, policies or rules affecting the Ethereum network, through which
Latium operates, or restricting the right to acquire, own, hold, sell, convert, trade, or use Latium tokens. To
