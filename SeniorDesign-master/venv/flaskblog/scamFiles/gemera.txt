Introduction
Investing  in  Colombian  emeralds  is  becoming  more  popular  due  to  their  unique
characteristics, beauty, and scarcity. There are Colombian emeralds worth more than
USD 10 billion in the market. Currently, 5 to 10% of the yearly production is used for
investment purposes, and it is expected to grow up to 50% in the coming years.
Figure 1. Uses of Emeralds
Colombian emerald production is a multimillion dollar industry, thanks to the outstanding
quality of these gemstones and their international fame. For instance, in the scale of
tonality,  Colombian  emeralds,  according  to  experts  and  gemologists,  are  the  most
balanced, which means they are not very dark nor very light; in other words, they have a
perfect saturation. Also, they stand out for their deep clarity and often extraordinary size.
All these attributes make Colombian emeralds a desired precious gemstone, whose
demand has been growing day by day and whose value has not decreased in the latest
years. Plus, there are very few mines; new ones have not been discovered in a long time,
which  means  they  are  a  scarce  asset,  with  unique  qualities,  which  make  them  an
attractive and profitable investment.
However, investing in emeralds is a difficult decision, due to several factors: a standard
investment involves a transaction of thousands of dollars, the investor must have a
specialized knowledge of the characteristics of the emeralds and their value in the market
to be sure on paying a fair price, discounts are only possible with large investments and
there is uncertainty about  the  origin  of  the gemstones,  as  well as  about the legal,
environmental and labor practices during the production.
On the other hand, there are too many intermediaries all along the emerald production
chain,  from  the  mines  where  the  gemstones  are  extracted  to  the  final  customers.
3




Besides, these intermediaries do not give any added value to the product. Without these
intermediaries, it would be possible that final customer pays less for the investment and
the producer earns more for the emeralds.
GEMERA will help to transform that traditional investment model into a modern, fairer,
transparent and democratic ecosystem, by connecting investors and emerald producers
directly with a blockchain based platform, that contains a crypto-token 100% backed by
Colombian emeralds and a marketplace with all the decentralized information about each
one of these gemstones.
GEMERA Project
GEMERA is a crypto-token backed by Colombian emeralds that provides a mixture of
secure digital assets managed by blockchain and physical Colombian emeralds stored
in security vaults of safe deposit box companies.
The Project offers an innovative and modern investment opportunity, more profitable,
accessible, democratic and transparent, by connecting producers and investors through
the advantages granted by the blockchain technology, producing in that manner win-win
benefits for these two actors.
The project  will  also  develop  a blockchain-based marketplace platform to store  the
information of the emeralds that back the GEMERA tokens in a decentralized way.
As GEMERA works hand in hand with emerald producers, it is also part of its politics to
partner  only  with companies  with good  environmental practices in  the  extraction of
gemstones and with corporate social responsibility standards that seek for the integrity
of their workers and the communities nearby, helping them and other stakeholders to
improve their quality of life and to open their path towards sustainable development. The
project uses part of the project funds to achieve this purpose.

Problems
There is a long process that an emerald goes through the value chain, from its discovery
in Colombian mines to the final holder, which generates several problems for both the
investors and the producers, as specified below:
Problems on the Investor’s Side:
•   High prices.
•   Investing  in  emeralds  can  be  complicated  and  risky  without  adequate
knowledge about them.
•   Partial and small investments are not possible.
•   Lack of trust in the emeralds origin.
Problems on the Producer’s Side:
•   Receive  less  than  35%  of  the  final  customer  retail  price  due  to  many
intermediaries.
•   Difficulty in expanding into new markets.
Investor                                                                                   Jewelry

GEMERA’s Solutions
GEMERA’s purpose is to create an innovative and modern investment opportunity that
at the same time solves problems in the Colombian emerald’s value chain, through the
creation of crypto-tokens 100% backed by this asset, that can be redeemed for the very
gemstones they represent, and even used as a store of value or as a trading token.
Hence, by holding GEMERA tokens, investors hold at the same time the value of the
emeralds that come directly from Colombian emerald producers and are stored in secure
vaults. In that way, no intermediaries are needed, which translates into benefits for both,
investor and producer: the first one gets incentives of around 20% of bonuses during the
Token Generation Events (TGE), available also for small investments, and the producer
receives up to 15% more, based on the retail price.
GEMERA has focused its efforts on the early stage of the project to create a model, along
with gemologists and experts in fine Colombian emeralds, with all the necessary criteria
to assess and determine the quality of the emeralds, in a clear and transparent manner.
That way an investor does not need to be a great connoisseur in the emeralds field or
hire expensive specialists when wanting to make an investment decision. In other words,
GEMERA has a reliable method to guarantee the quality of the gemstones, as well as
the adequate price according to the established criteria.
The  information  about  the  characteristics,  certification,  pictures,  and  video  of  the
emeralds is exhibited in detail on GEMERA’s marketplace, including audit results and the
safe deposit box company location where they are stored.                                           The emerald characteristics
information  will be stored in the blockchain using Ethereum main network, and the
certification  and  audit  records  will  be  stored  in  a  decentralized  manner,  using  the
InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
In general, GEMERA is offering a set of modern solutions for the producer to expand to
new markets and to final customers to invest in emeralds in a much easier way, besides
the enormous advantage of counting on an online platform, based on blockchain, to do
so,  an  alternative  that  was  not  available  in  the  emerald  industry  or  in  the  crypto
community until now.

Colombian Emeralds
Emeralds are excellent as a store of value due to a set of different factors: physical
attributes, scarcity, and even the historical background. The most famous come from
Colombia, which has dominated the international trade for almost five centuries. Although
there are other lead producers, such as Zambia and Brazil, the unique characteristics of
the Colombian emeralds are an important differentiation, which makes them the most
desired in the world.
The secret resides in the millenary recipe of elements, including aluminum, silicate oxide,
chromium, iron, and vanadium, which initiated the eons-long formation process of the
emeralds  starting  30-38  million  years  ago,  during  the  development  of  the  Andean
mountains.
But the process also depends on how intensively the elements act during formation. In
the case of Colombian emeralds, the shining chromium, combined with the leveled
vanadium and iron in lower quantities give the unique tone to the beryl before it is turned
into an emerald. If the gemstone had a higher level of iron, its green color would be
opaque. If the vanadium were the distinct element, the stone would obtain a yellowish
hue.  So,  it  is  the  balanced  combination  of  these  elements  what  gives  Colombian
emeralds a rich, vivid and intense green color, unreachable even for Zambian or Brazilian
emeralds.
On the other hand, Colombia hosts inside its mountains the oldest and most important
emerald mining areas in the world, Muzo, Coscuez, Maripí and Chivor, where the best,
rarest and most expensive emeralds are produced. Although there are slight differences
in the color of the emeralds these mines produce, the perfect saturation and vividness
are a common characteristic among them, and this is precisely one of the main factors
that make them more desired.
Even before the Spaniard conquest, in the XV century, emeralds were mined in that
region by indigenous tribes, and, of course, they became desired and started to be traded
widely during the conquest, as part of the treasures collected in the so-called New World.
That gives these precious gemstones another added value, attractive to buyers and
investors worldwide: a historical, mythical and enigmatic background.

Colombian Emerald Market
Colombia  has  been  the  main  provider  of  high-quality  emeralds  for  more  than  five
centuries and has become a reference and standard of quality for traders, producers,
and investors. Nowadays, more than 70% of the world’s market supplies of emeralds
come from this country, and they are the most expensive per carat. The total amount of
cut emeralds exported from Colombia in 2017 is close to USD 126 million, according to
the National Federation of Colombian Emeralds -Fedesmeraldas’s Management Report
(see Figure 3).
USD 140.325.328
USD 134.812.894
USD 142.599.909
USD 116.324.250
USD 125.302.767
USD 122.391.480
Figure 3. Export of Cut Colombian Emeralds (USD)

But also, the emeralds in general and the Colombian in particular are becoming the most
appreciated and valuable of all precious gemstones. For instance, according to Gemval
(an organization of value reference and appraisal of gems), with figures of 1 February
2018, the price of rough emeralds has increased 135% since 2013.
In the case of Colombian emeralds, they have fetched the range of USD 5.000 to USD
15.000 per carat, depending of course on the size, color, clarity, and enhancement type.
But even a Colombian emerald with the best quality could reach a price of around USD
120.000 per carat, a high contrast when making the comparison with an emerald of
similar quality from other parts of the world, where the price could reach USD 80.000 per
carat.

With these numbers, it would not be inaccurate to say that a fine emerald’s price could
be higher than that of a fine diamond. Even experts and traders agree on the fact that
emeralds could become a more appreciated gemstone than diamonds; it is said that the
first could exceed the latter in the market share by 20% in the next two decades, taking
into account the growing tendency of emeralds in the latest years, according to the
Diamonds  International  Manufacturers  Association.  This  is  also  due  to  their  rarity:
emeralds are 20 times scarcer than diamonds, thanks to all the special elements and
conditions required on their formation, mentioned above.
This  growing  tendency  of  emeralds  in  the  gemstone  industry  is  of  course  led  by
Colombia, and traders, producers, and experts coincide that it will continue to be in the
forefront, in the following years, adding the fact that emeralds are projected to increase
its use for investment in the upcoming years, even equaling the percentage of its current
use for jewelry.
Another advantage is the processes and methods applied to emeralds in Colombia after
the extraction, such as cutting, enhancement, assessment and certification, which meet
international standards, both in the scientific and technological areas. This industry is
also known for its good environmental and working practices, and for being an important
source of social progress for the communities around the mines where the emeralds are
extracted. Therefore, besides profit, Colombian emeralds are a responsible, ethical and
integral asset.
In conclusion, Colombian emeralds are a promising and stable industry, full of history
and enchantment, which is destined to reach more and more markets worldwide and an
excellent investment decision.
Highlights
o  Emeralds produced in Colombia are well known internationally for their beauty and
quality.
o  Colombian emeralds stand out for their perfect saturation, unique shine, and vivid
color.
o  For more than five centuries, Colombia has been the world’s biggest producer of
emeralds.
o  Colombian emeralds have reached almost every part of the  world. The main
purchasers in 2016 were the United States, Hong Kong, Thailand, India, Israel,
Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and Japan, among others.
10




o  Colombian emeralds were formed from hydrothermal deposits; that is, seabeds
that are now mountains. This gives them unique characteristics that define their
value.
o  The environmental footprint of emerald mining is lower in comparison to other
types of mining because it is a manual process, and no mercury or cyanide is
necessary for the extraction process.
Emerald Producers Alliance
GEMERA’s first alliance with emerald producers was with 4Cs Emeralds, a company that
produces and exports Colombian emeralds from the biggest Colombian mines, such as
Cunas, in Maripí region, and Nuevo Milenio and Las Pavas, in the Muzo region. It was
incorporated in Colombia in 2008, with a major trajectory in the market since then. In
2016 and 2017, the company exported USD 4.6 million and USD 11 million, respectively.
4Cs has the full capacity of supplying the emeralds that support the tokens issuance after
GEMERA’s Token Generation Events (TGE).

Table 2. Token Information
Each emerald has a fixed value in GEMERAs, according to its weight and quality, which
is  determined  through  the  Emerald  Assessment  Process,  a  model  developed  by
GEMERA along with gemologists and fine Colombian emerald experts to determine the
quality and price of these gemstones.
GEMERA is a token based on Ethereum ERC20 standard and has the following features:
•    GEMERAs can be traded in exchanges.
•    GEMERAs can be used as a store of value.
•    GEMERAs can be transferred to compatible wallets.
•    GEMERAs can be redeemed for physical emeralds.
Token Generation Event Process
A  Token  Generation  Event  (TGE)  is  open  during  a  period,  where  an  amount  of
GEMERAs is offered and ready to be acquired by investors. Once the TGE closes, the
project starts a process of selection, certification, assessment, transport, and storage of
emeralds  to  back  the  sold  tokens.  The  selected  emeralds  are  then  exposed  onto
GEMERA´s marketplace  (market.gemera.io). The total value of the emeralds will be
coincident with the value of the issued tokens.

Gemera  is  a  proof-of-asset  token  and  does  not  have  a  fixed  supply,  it  is  created
dynamically, and it is limited to Colombian emeralds production. This gemstone is scarcer
than diamonds; therefore, the project does not expect to issue high amounts of tokens.
This is an important factor for investors.
The project´s vision is to tokenize Colombian emeralds and having 100 million tokens
issued by 2029. (See the GEMERA Token Projection on page 20).

Marketplace
An emerald marketplace on the GEMERA Project website is available for GEMERA
holders who want to redeem their tokens for the emeralds (market.gemera.io). Each one
of  them  is  accompanied  with  precise  information:  name,  characteristics,  price  in
GEMERAs, certification, as well as photographs from different angles, and a 360° video.
The Project will use the Ethereum main network to store all the emerald information and
status and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store the audit and recertification
files.
The following is the information exhibited on the marketplace:

must consult the local tax office to see what import duties and/or VAT are required.
Also, the redeemer can collect the emeralds directly in the safe deposit box
company where they are stored. Some countries have restrictions to import loose
gemstones.
•   Disposal: The redeemed tokens are destroyed virtually, in order to keep the
balance  between  the  tokens  in  circulation  and  the  total  value  of  the  stored
emeralds.
GEMERA  charges  a  fee  of  3%  over  the  tokens  to  be  redeemed  to  process  the
redemption.

Business Model
To be a sustainable and profitable project, GEMERA has two revenue sources. The first
comes from the Token Generation Events (TGE) and the second from the redemption
process.
The early stage of the project, from the conception of the idea to the first TGE, is being
sponsored  by  Colombian  emerald  producers,  the  founders  and  angel  investors.
Currently, there is a batch of emeralds stored in Hong Kong, with a value of around USD
1 million in the retail price. This stock was supplied by the producers to initiate the project.
The founders and angel investors contributed with USD 500.000 to carry out the first
stage of the project, such as software development, legal advice, company incorporation,
team salary and marketing strategy to launch the first TGE.
TGE Funds Allocation
The funds collected during the TGEs will be distributed in the following manner:

•   Emerald  Producers:  With  GEMERA  Project,  Colombian  emerald  producers
expect to expand the global emerald market and open new ones, which translate
into more investment opportunities. Currently, producers receive less than 35% of
the final customer’s sales price. Through GEMERA, this income will increase up
to 15%. Then, as the Project’s main partners, the first 50% of the funds will be
intended for the emerald producers.
•   GEMERA Founders and Angel Investors: It is intended for the founders and
angel investors, who participated in the seed round, and whose funds were used
to  finance  the  early  stage  of  the  project.  They  are  currently  GEMERA´s
shareholders.
•   Marketing: It is used to carry out the project’s marketing strategies, such as
presence  in  roadshows,  press  releases,  and  sponsored  articles,  premium
specialized listings, advertisement, and influencers. For this purpose, the funds
are allocated in the following manner:

Technology
GEMERA tokens are based on the blockchain technology, which can be compared to a
ledger or database. Each block in the chain contains data, just like a page in a traditional
ledger. But the crucial advancement over a traditional ledger is that the blockchain exists
in a  distributed  fashion.  Every  block  can only be  added to  the  previous one if  the
information  contained  within is  agreed  upon  by the consensus of  a  majority of  the
participants of the network. In the case of Ethereum, there are hundreds of thousands of
participants called nodes confirming transactions as they appear. All participants agree
to follow the rules laid out in the blockchain protocol. Once a block is agreed as correct
according to the protocol (consensus algorithm), it is added to the chain and cannot be
altered. This means that transactions cannot be reversed once confirmed.
In this way, blockchain technology enables, for the first time, a secure transaction of value
without the need for an intermediary. While credit and debit cards enable money to
change hands digitally, they still rely on a central authority, like a bank. The disadvantage
of requiring a central authority is that users are subject to high fees, especially when
transacting across borders. Blockchain technology, however, eliminates the need for
banks  by  enabling  direct  peer-to-peer  exchange,  and  because  transactions  are
distributed across servers all over the world and data is cryptographically secured, it is
nearly impossible to hack. Blockchain is then a disruptive technology, so it is important
to understand the technology behind it and how it will shape the economy of the future.
Thus, to store the emerald characteristics and status, the marketplace will use blockchain
and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) will be used to store the certification and audit
files, a decentralized file storage technology that works as a peer-to-peer protocol that
guarantees more trust, security, and speed access.
GEMERA Token
The Ethereum blockchain supports GEMERA tokens and uses a standard ERC20 smart
contract.
21




According to www.ethereum.org, "Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart
contracts:  applications  that  run  exactly  as  programmed  without  any  possibility  of
downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. These apps run on a custom
built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move
value around and represent the ownership of property."
Ethereum is one of the most reputable, used, established, safe and proven platforms for
smart contracts. For these reasons, the  GEMERA Project chose this technology to
support the GEMERA tokens.
ERC20 based token smart contract and sale smart contract will be developed using unit
tests. Functional tests are based on:
-   Ethereum Private Blockchain at the development stage.
-   Ethereum  Rinkeby  Testnet                                                                (staging)  with  the  help  of  web  front-end
developed.
The following security best practices will be used:
-   http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-considerations.html
-   https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices
-   https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/onward-with-ethereum-smart-contract-
security-97a827e47702
Smart Contract Features
•   Number of Tokens: Dynamically mintable. Limited to emerald production.
•   Freeze Tokens Feature: NO
Tokens cannot be frozen at any given time.
•   Burn Tokens Feature: YES
The tokens used on the redemption periods are destroyed, thereby reducing the total
amount of released tokens and keeping the balance between the tokens offered and
the value of the emeralds in the marketplace. This feature can only be called by
permitted 50 Ethereum addresses specified by GEMERA.
•   Total Amount of Tokens to Be Sold: is specified by GEMERA for each TGE.
22




•   Token Price (Rate): is specified by GEMERA for each TGE.
•   Bonuses:  GEMERA  specifies  the  amount  of  the  bonus  for  customers  (as  a
percentage of the purchase) for each TGE.
•   Withdrawal Terms: Tokens withdrawal will happen in the end of the TGE.
•   End Terms: TGE automatically ends if any of the following terms is met:
-   The specified duration of TGE is expired.
-   The specified total amounts of tokens during this TGE are sold.
Marketplace
GEMERA’s marketplace uses a mixture of traditional technologies, blockchain, and IPFS.
The current technology used for each layer is described below:
InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)
Ethereum Main Net

The INFURA API provides secure, reliable, and scalable access to Ethereum and IPFS.
This solution eliminates the need to configure and maintain the infrastructure required to
access  these  networks.  INFURA  is  used  for  important  projects  in  the  market  like
Metamask, Digix, and Oraclize, among others.
All the information in the details tab (see Figure 12), besides the price in GEMERAs of
the emeralds, will be stored on the Ethereum network.

Emerald Assessment Process
GEMERA created a model along with gemologists and experts to determine the quality
of emeralds and set up a price for them in tokens.
Emerald Quality Parameters
Evaluating the quality of an emerald is not an easy task since there are different factors
to take into consideration; for instance, it is possible to find emeralds of the same carat
and cut with a significant difference in price.
That is why an analysis, as well as a clear and transparent methodology, is necessary to
determine the quality of the emeralds and therefore establish the price in GEMERA
tokens. Thus, to accomplish this, the project designed a model along with a team of
specialists in fine Colombian emeralds and followed the parameters of the Gemological
Institute  of  America                                                                        (GIA)  for  assessing  some  of  the  characteristics  of  these
gemstones.
Furthermore, to analyze the quality of an emerald, the GEMERA Project takes into
account the color, clarity, enhancement and cut parameters, which are used by gemstone
traders  to  determine  the  value  of  emeralds.  Their  support  has  been  paramount  in
designing the present model.
The description of each one of these parameters and how the GEMERA Project links
them in its model is given below:
Color
It is considered the most important feature in the price estimation of emeralds, and it is
divided into three categories: hue, tone, and saturation, according to the GIA.
The GEMERA Project considers only the tone of the emeralds, classified in intense,
medium and light to make the first quality classification. This is a subjective process.
25




Clarity
Emeralds usually have certain spots within that affect their clarity and transparency.
These spots are known as inclusions. They are divided into three types: crystals, fluids
(prints left during the formation of the stone) and fissures. These inclusions are very
common and natural, and they are found even in high-quality emeralds, so they are
accepted in the jewelry industry; 99% of emeralds have them. Actually, when an emerald
is not included, it might mean the stone is not authentic. However, the fewer inclusions
an emerald has, it is considered cleaner, so its price rises.
The GEMERA Project considers the Clarity Type III of the GIA. The stones analyzed in
this category are almost always included and show eye-visible inclusions. They are
classified according to the following clarity grades:
-                                                                                             Eye-Clean: the emerald appears clean to the unaided eye.
-                                                                                             Slightly Included: noticeable inclusions apparent to the unaided eye.
-                                                                                             Moderately Included: obvious inclusions very apparent to the unaided eye.
-                                                                                             Heavily  Included:  prominent  inclusions  that  have  a  negative  effect  on
                                                                                              appearance and durability on the emerald.
-                                                                                             Severely  Included:  prominent  inclusions  that  have  a  severe  effect  on
                                                                                              appearance, durability, or both.
Enhancement
Emeralds undergo an enhancement process with essential oils, resins or wax in fissures
and cavities to improve the clarity of the stone. Fissures are defined as small fractures
within the stone that do not compromise the beauty of emeralds significantly. However,
when a stone has a large number of fissures, it is common for it to be treated to reduce
their visibility and therefore enhance the beauty and durability of the gem. Cavities, on
the other hand, are wide fractures present on the surface of some emeralds, which can
affect the durability of the stone significantly. These cavities always have to be treated.
In that order, the price of an emerald changes depending on the amount of enhancement
and whether it is applied to fissures or cavities (in cases where the analyzed gemstones
have them).
26




To assess the enhancement level, the GEMERA Project uses the basis of the category
scale designed by the Laboratory Manual Harmonisation Committee (LMHC), which
gathers the best laboratories in the world and whose purpose is to “create a general
philosophy for proper nomenclature and disclosure for laboratories as well to initiate and
suggest  ‘preferable’  language  to  be  used  in  the  trade,”  and  the  World  Jewelry
Confederation (CIBJO), whose mission is “to represent the interest of all individuals,
organisations and companies earning their livelihoods from jewelry, gemstones and
precious metals, and to encourage harmonisation, promote international cooperation in
the jewelry industry, and to consider issues which concern the trade worldwide”.

As cavities require a major enhancement process, the emeralds with these conditions
will  receive  a  reduction  in  the  estimated  price,  as  can  be  seen  in  the  Emerald
Assessment Process.
Cut
This  refers  to  the  various  forms  the  emerald  is  cut  into,  based  on  its  original
characteristics and the desired piece of jewelry that is to be made. The cut gives the
shape to the stone, such as round, princess, cushion, emerald, oval, radiant, asscher,
marquise,  heart  or  pear,  among  others.  Emerald,  cushion,  and  pear  are  the  most
appreciated shapes in the market, in the mentioned order.
Cabochon is the name of the emeralds with a round and convex form. Taking into account
that these stones are polished and not cut into facets, they are less appreciated. The
project will reduce the price of the stones of this type.
Carat Weight
Although the weight of an emerald might be decisive to set up a price, it is not the main
factor that determines the quality of the emerald. However, the larger an emerald is, the
higher its price per carat is.
Therefore, GEMERA Project uses the carat weight to establish the price of the emeralds,
according to the Tone Range, along with the Clarity and Enhancement Classification,
as specified in the Emerald Assessment Process.

Marketing
Asia-Pacific  is  the  market  that  shows  more  interest  in  Colombian  emeralds  as  an
attractive asset for investment, according to GEMERA’s research about the emerald
industry. So, added to the fact that this region also plays an outstanding role in the crypto
community, it becomes an important target audience for GEMERA’s marketing strategy.
However, other regions will also be included in the planning, such as Europe, who has
been an important actor in the crypto community, and Latin America, who has big growth
potential in this matter.
The marketing strategy will be divided in the following manner:
-                                                                                               Press Releases and Sponsored  Articles: Press releases  and sponsored
articles will be released in important media outlets about crypto economy and
blockchain, social media and the GEMERA community.

Operations
Beside the daily operation of GEMERA, other processes take place in different periods,
related with the management of the emeralds once the TGEs are close, when they are
supplied by the producers, such as storage and insurance of the gemstones, or when
they are already stored, such as the audit process.
These stages make part of the transparency policy of GEMERA, reason why a rigorous
analysis and processes are necessary and have to be informed adequately, including
information through press releases to the token holders and the rest of the GEMERA’s
community.
Storage and Insurance
Before the storage stage, trusted providers insure the emeralds. The GEMERA Project
also has a rigorous protocol for introducing new emeralds to the secure vault of safe
deposit box companies in countries with the security standards for gemstone storage or
withdrawing the ones to be redeemed.
To select a new deposit box company, the Project studies the city and country conditions
where it is located, in issues as economic situation, security indices, political stability and
strategic location according to GEMERA´s target markets, among other factors.
Audit
To reinforce the transparency of the process, a yearly audit to verify the authenticity and
quality of the emeralds is developed by a trusted company, which carries out the following
process:

Reinstatement Process
When any of the emeralds audited factors is not successful, a process to reinstate the
emeralds initiates. In the case the inventory of the emeralds does not correspond to the
emeralds exhibited in the marketplace, it must be established whose responsibility it is.
If it is a GEMERA´s error, the company would make an internal analysis and respond
with its own funds to reinstate the missed stone, which must have the same price. If it is
a responsibility of the storage provider, the emerald insurance will be effective.
In the case the recertification does not match with the initial certification, GEMERA must
incorporate  an  emerald  with  the  same  price  and  characteristics  and  start  a  new
certification and assessment process, as seen in Figure 15.

Legal Aspects
GEMERA operates through a separate and distinct issuer company and operating entity.
The first, GEMERA Ltd., is incorporated in  the British Virgin Islands  (BVI), and the
second, Emera Ltd., in Hong Kong.
Therefore, the company is under the rules of law and legislation, including taxes, AML
and KYC laws, from the BVI.
4Cs  Emeralds  Colombia  Ltd.  exports  the  emeralds  and  delivers  them  to  GEMERA
Project in Hong Kong with all the legal requirements.

Environmental and Social Responsibility
Good  environmental  practices  in  the  emerald  production  and  social  responsibility
standards are a transcendental issue in GEMERA’s politics. For that reason, as part of
its fund’s allocation, 3% of the whole revenues will be destined to carry out social and
environmental projects in the emerald production and the communities of the emerald
mining areas.
This type of initiatives will be executed by the Colombian Emerald Producers Association
(Aprecol), that has a major role in the emerald industry influence zone and has been
developing activities such as infrastructure enhancement of educational facilities, food
subsidy,  capacitation  for  workforce  and  planning  of  the  waste  management  in  the
emeralds productive chain, among many other strategies.
The environmental footprint for emerald mining, in general, is by definition lower than
other types of mining. This is because it is a manual process and no polluting substances
such as mercury or cyanide are required.
When it comes to the exploitation of emeralds in Colombia specifically, the industry has
been progressive in its acceptance of social responsibility. In addition to adhering to
international standards for the protection of the environment, Colombian emerald mines
have been proactive in protecting workers rights. Excavation tunnels are constructed with
specialized  machinery  to  the  highest  safety  standards                                     (for  example  with  steel
reinforcement and oxygenation).
Workplace safety training, transportation methods, and personal protection for workers
meet or even exceed international standards. Additionally, Colombian emerald mines
support local communities through endowments for scholarships and funding for cultural
and sports activities. In other words, emerald mining in Colombia is not an isolated activity
which consists only of extracting gemstones to satisfy the necessity of the market, but it
is also a way to advance and improve the lifestyle of local communities.

FAQ
Why is GEMERA a revolutionary project?
GEMERA is one step ahead of the new tendency of tokenization of assets, as it is
a project that provides a token backed by a scarce and a desired asset, that can
also be used for trading and that can be redeemed for the very emeralds they
represent. Also, the whole project will transform the distribution chain of emeralds,
connecting producers, and final customers, through a crypto-token that can be
traded or used as a store of value.
Why should an investor consider participating in GEMERA?
Through the tokenization of Colombian emeralds, GEMERA wants to help the
market expand significantly, and increase the demand worldwide, making it a more
democratic, transparent and accessible investment. However, as the supply of
emeralds is limited, their price is expected to rise.
Also, as part of the philosophy and purpose of GEMERA is to carry out social and
environmental initiatives with part of the project funds, investors will have the
opportunity  to  indirectly  contribute  to  the  sustainable  development  of  the
communities near the gemstone mines.
How long does GEMERA take to store the emeralds that back the tokens?
GEMERA project takes approximately three months after every Token Generation
Event (TGE) ends to store the emeralds that back the tokens in a secure vault of
a safe deposit box company.
Where are the emeralds stored?
Emeralds will be stored in secure vaults of safe deposit box companies that meet
the security standards of storing this type of asset. The first batch of these stones
is stored in secure vaults of a trusted safe deposit box company in Hong Kong.
37




What is the marketplace?
It is a website (market.gemera.io) with the information of each one of the emeralds
stored in a secure vault of safe deposit box companies worldwide and ready to be
redeemed  with  GEMERAs.  The  information  of  the  emeralds  includes  name,
characteristics, price in GEMERAs, and certification, as well as a  360° video,
photographs from different angles and traceability decentralized records from the
origin of the gemstones.
How is the value of the emeralds in GEMERAs determined?
GEMERA has along with gemologists and experts in fine Colombian emeralds
developed an Emerald Assessment Process, a model that considers color, clarity,
carat, enhancement, weight and cut to determine the quality of the emeralds and
set up the price.
Are my GEMERA tokens directly linked to a specific emerald?
No. Whenever the GEMERA holders want to redeem their tokens for emeralds,
they can visit the marketplace (market.gemera.io) to find the ones they want to
acquire in accordance to the number of GEMERAs they would like to redeem.
How can I be sure the emeralds are stored in a safe deposit box company?
The GEMERA Project focuses on the transparency of the process throughout its
value chain: the origin, the selection of the emeralds, the certification every stone
must have, the storage, how the emeralds’ quality and its value in GEMERA tokens
are determined, and how the holders can redeem them, among other aspects of
equal importance.
Therefore,  each  gemstone  is  exhibited  in  GEMERA  Project’s  marketplace
(market.gemera.io), along with the name of the safe deposit box company it is
stored at. An audit process will take place to guarantee the existence, origin, and
characteristics of the emeralds.

Conclusion
Blockchain technology is a revolutionary new way for people to make different sorts of
transactions, in a democratic, secure, decentralized, and transparent way. This allows
GEMERA to accomplish its purpose of connecting emerald producers and investors and
to create an easily accessible channel for investing in this asset.
Through this technology, the GEMERA Project wants to offer investors crypto-tokens that
can be used as a store of value, along with a guarantee that the tokens are based on
real emeralds which can also be purchased by investors with their GEMERA tokens,
during the redemption periods.
Therefore, investors will have the chance to invest in a profitable asset and at the same
time will hold tokens that will likely increase its value.
The  GEMERA  Project  focuses  on  the  transparency  of  the  process,  from  the  initial
selection of the gemstones, through obtaining the certification every stone must have,
the storage, how the stone’s quality and its price in GEMERA tokens are determined,
and finally to how the holders can use them, among other features of equal importance.
The partnership with gemstone producers also creates the circumstances for GEMERA
to contribute to carrying out social and environmental activities in the communities where
the gemstones are extracted and produced.
Hence, a part of the project funds will be used to execute strategies that help these
influence zones to achieve the so-called sustainable development. This means GEMERA
holders are also contributing to this praiseworthy cause by supporting this project.
