TECHNICAL NOTES
Seesaw Reward
Balance System
Whitepaper
aka the
‘Purplepaper’
Revision 0.8a March 23 2017 Pivx.org




These technical notes are intended to formally
document and describe the features and
concepts of the Private Instant Verified
Transaction cryptocurrency. This specific
document will thoroughly explain in detail the
technical details of the Seesaw Reward Balance
System along with its intended benefits.




INTRODUCTION
The majority of crypto currencies that make use of masternodes,
split their block reward per block equally between the mining
and masternode distribution mechanisms. The intended fairness
of this reward distribution can be subverted by the growth of
masternodes held by large investors without limits leading to
potential centralization of the budgeting system much like having
a majority shareholder in a company. The additional benefits of
masternodes can lead to less number of users conducting Proof of
Stake (PoS) mining activities and thus lowering the security of the
PoS network.
Masternodes do provide a valuable service and should be
rewarded for that service, but our aim here is not to reward them
way beyond the extra value they provide. For we believe that doing
so disproportionately benefits masternode owners above and
beyond other users of the system and ultimately leads to a greater
degree of centralization.

TECHNICAL NOTES   - Seesaw Reward Balance System
To  overcome  this  problem,  the
feature outlined in this paper was
developed and implemented with
the sole intention of ensuring the
security of the PoS network. This is
achieved by creating an incentive
to   stake,   which   subsequently
promotes  liquidity  in  exchanges
and controls the growth rate and
count of the masternode network.

PIVX OVERVIEW
Private Instant Verified Transaction, PIVX, is a privacy focused
decentralized open source cryptocurrency launched in Feb 1 2016
under the name of Darknet (DNET) before it was professionally
re-branded to PIVX. Initial Proof of Work (PoW) distribution phase
ended August 2016 when DNET transitioned to the current Proof
of Stake (PoS) phase.
PIVX runs on Blackcoin PoS 2.0[1] protocol and is based on Bitcoin
core 0.10.x code base. It utilizes a network of masternodes[2] for an
openly visible decentralized governance and increased transaction
privacy.
The main goal of PIVX is to achieve near instant private
transactions and a governance that helps sustain the network for
the benefit of all of the users involved. While we are well on our
way to achieving this, some of the features are under development
and should appear in the near future.

PIVX OVERVIEW cont...
PIVX has an open task and development environment and a
highly accessible development team utilizing multiple social
networking channels, including social media. The development
team is welcoming of anyone and everyone to join its cause,
regardless of technical expertise. We encourage people to just go
ahead and do things rather than having lots of gatekeepers or
a hierarchical structure where permissions are required to move
forward.

PROOF OF STAKE 2.0 OVERVIEW
To achieve consensus; Proof of Stake 2.0 (PoS) requires nodes
running a wallet software proving that it has coins in the
blockchain in order to verify a block of transactions. The
participating nodes receive an amount of blocks proportional to
their stake per set period as a form of reward.
This means that with lots of participating nodes (with roughly even
amounts of coins) the network becomes very secure due to the
increased difficulty of owning a majority of coins in the network.
MASTERNODES OVERVIEW
Masternodes are nodes running the same wallet software on the
same blockchain to provide extra services to the network. These
services include coin mixing for increased privacy of transactions,
instant transactions and a decentralized governance that provides
a decentralized budgeting system with immutable proposal and
voting systems.
For providing such services, masternodes are also paid a certain
portion of reward for each block. This can serve as a passive
income to the masternode owners minus their running cost.

TECHNICAL NOTES   - Seesaw Reward Balance System
MAIN FEATURE OVERVIEW
To promote an even ratio between staking nodes and
masternodes in the network, the PIVX team has developed a
variable Seesaw Reward Balance System that dynamically adjusts
its block reward size between masternodes and staking nodes.
Each PIVX PoS block reward is split with 10% dedicated to the
budgeting system and 90% dedicated to both the masternodes
and stake mining reward. The reward portion is further split
dynamically via the Seesaw Reward Balance System between
masternodes and staking nodes.
The logic is simple in its roots. The higher the masternode count,
the smaller the reward portion of each PoS block that will be
paid out to the masternodes and the larger the reward portion
for staking nodes. Conversely, when the masternode count falls,
the masternode reward portion is increased and the staking node
reward portion decreased.
The PoS block reward starts with a ratio of 9 to 1 towards
masternodes when the amount of coins locked to masternodes is
lower than 1% of the total coin supply.
But as the number of coins locked to masternodes go above 41.5%
of the total PIVX coin supply, the block reward amount will shift
with more than 50% of the block reward going to staking nodes.

This has the effect of making it less attractive to provision more
masternodes as it has the potential to significantly lower its
profitability compared to staking that has less upkeep cost.
This threshold was selected as it would allow a strong network
of profitable masternodes while creating incentive for approx.
60% of the total coin supply to be available for staking to
secure the network and to maintain liquidity.
Another intended benefit and goal of the Seesaw Reward
Balance System is to ensure that it is more profitable for users
running masternodes than it would be to stake the equal
number of coins, under the normal circumstances of being
below the equilibrium threshold. The reason behind this is due
to the extra cost, risk and time associated with maintaining the
masternodes are greater than staking alone.

SEE SAW EFFECT
Following graph shows the block reward amount (Y axis) for
the masternodes (RED) and staking nodes (BLUE) against the
percentage of total coin supply locked by masternodes (X axis)
starting from block 648,000 (mid-May 2017) where each block
rewards is fixed at 5 PIV.
Following graph shows the their theoretical annual percentage
return starting from block 648,000 where each block is fixed at 5
PIV with an interval of 60 seconds. (1440 blocks a day)

The RED line represents the return of masternodes when there is
zero upkeep cost per masternode and GREEN line is the logical
masternode return curve on a hypothetical scenario where there is
an annual upkeep cost of $300 per masternode with the price of
each PIV at $1 USD.

CODE LOGIC WALKTHROUGH
The logic is intended to be simple as possible while being effective.
This is to ensure its stability and to be able to easily determine its
outcome and improve its logic if the need arises.
if  (mNodeCoins  <=  (nMoneySupply  *  .01) && mNodeCoins  >  0)  {
ret  = blockValue  *  .90;
}
The blockValue is the total number of coins per block. This value is
multiplied by the variable ratio that is determined by the percentage
of the masternode coins, (mNodeCoins) in relation to the total coin
supply (nMoneySupply). The result ret value is the number of coins for
the masternodes portion of the reward.
Above example shows the very first logic used to determine the
highest masternode portion payout. You can see that if mNodecoins
is less than or equal to 1% of the coin supply (nMoneySupply) and also
greater than 0, the return block reward value for the masternode will
be 90% of the PoS block (ret = blockValue * .90).
This logic continues for each increase in set percentages all the way
until mNodeCoins is less than or equal to 99% of the coin supply.
else if  (mNodeCoins  <=  (nMoneySupply  *  .99)
&& mNodeCoins  >  (nMoneySupply  *.987))  {
ret  = blockValue  *  .05;
}
10




Any mNodeCoins value that is beyond 99% of the total coin
supply will return a fixed value equal to 1% of the blockValue. The
expectation is that it should never come to this point but the logic
is complete to cover all possible outcome.
else  {
ret                                                                    = blockValue  *   .01;
}
This Seesaw Reward Balance System algorithm initially started out
with only 16 percentage steps; it has since been improved and now
implements a total of 105 percentage steps to the variable seesaw
algorithm that allows for a far more granular   step amount.

TECHNICAL NOTES   - Seesaw Reward Balance System
SUMMARY
The Seesaw Reward Balance System that PIVX utilizes, provides
numerous benefits over reward split methods used by the majority of
masternode featuring Proof of Stake crypto-currencies.
1. It can indirectly affect the total count of masternodes in the
network by varying its reward size to alter its profitability versus
staking.
2. Promotes staking by increasing its reward payment portion when
masternode count is high and thus maintaining a high level of
network security.
3. Profitability of masternode is kept higher than staking as long as
the masternode count remains below the equilibrium threshold.
(Approx. 40% of coin supply)
4. Allows all coins owners to get rewarded for holding coins rather
than just the masternode owners, hence resulting in a fairer and less
centralized system.

FUTURE PLANS
As the Seesaw Reward Balance System is still relatively new (only 5
months old at the time of writing this document); fine tuning may be
required as the network grows and if better thresholds are deemed
more effective.
But even within the first 5 months of PoS with over 1400
masternodes that make up over 30% of the current coin supply; the
algorithm has been proven to work seamlessly as designed.
