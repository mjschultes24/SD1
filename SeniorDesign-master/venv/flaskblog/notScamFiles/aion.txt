Release v1.0.0, July 31, 2017
Abstract
Mainstream adoption of blockchain systems has been limited due to unsolved questions
of scalability, privacy, and interoperability. In this paper, we will outline a proposed design
for the Aion Network; a 3rd generation multi-tier blockchain system designed to address
these challenges. Core to our hypothesis is the idea that many blockchains will be created
to solve unique business challenges, within unique industries. As such, the Aion Network
is designed to support custom blockchain architectures, while providing a trustless mech-
anism for cross-chain interoperability.  At the root of this system is the world’s first dedi-
cated public enterprise blockchain, Aion-1; a state of the art blockchain that introduces a
new paradigm of security, and fair, representative crypto-economic incentives.
Roadmap
This paper is intended as a technical introduction, and will be followed by additional re-
search and design considerations.  As such, over the coming months, the Aion team will
publish a series of research papers that more thoroughly explain the concepts of the pro-
posed consensus algorithm, the virtual machine and scripting language, the bridge and
inter-chain transaction functionality, and the economic system underpinning the network.
In addition, following this introductory paper, Aion will release its fundraising strategy and
timeline for your consideration. We look forward to your feedback as we share our ideas
with you.

Mainstream adoption of blockchains has been limited because of scalability, privacy, and interoperability challenges.  Aion is the first
multi-tier blockchain network designed to address these challenges.
Core to our hypothesis is the idea that many blockchains will be created to solve unique business challenges within unique industries.
As such, the Aion network is designed to support custom blockchain architectures while providing a trustless mechanism for cross-chain
interoperability. At the root of the Aion network is the first dedicated, public, enterprise blockchain: Aion-1.
Aion-1 is a state-of-the-art, third-generation blockchain that introduces a new paradigm of security and fair, representative, cryptoeco-
nomic incentives.
This paper:
•  Introduces and explains the Aion network—the next generation of blockchain technology and first multi-tier blockchain network—
and its necessary infrastructures and protocols.
•  Details the vision and technical concepts of Aion-1, a purpose-built, public, third-generation blockchain and a component within
the Aion network.
•  Provides a roadmap for future implementations of Aion-1 and the Aion network.
These concepts are a work in progress and this paper is intended to establish intent and be exploratory in nature, not declarative. Join
the Aion network mailing list to get alerts about more detailed white papers related to specific aspects of Aion as they become available.

The landscape of digital currencies and related blockchain technologies has changed significantly since Bitcoin was first introduced in
2008.
2.1                                                                                                                                          First-generation blockchain
Bitcoin [1] led the way in the creation of numerous alternative currency platforms as the first generation of blockchain technology. These
first-generation blockchains provided a solution to conventional transaction limitations by implementing cryptographically-secure, peer-
to-peer, digital transactions that are verified by a decentralized global network and recorded into an immutable public ledger. Resulting
in a platform that leverages the advantages of being digital, while preserving the economics of scarcity.
2.2                                                                                                                                          Second-generation blockchain
With the second generation of blockchain, Ethereum introduced the ability to build application-specific logic upon a blockchain network
[2]. This enabled new capabilities beyond transactions to incorporate state, business logic, and multi-party contracts to be stored and
executed on a blockchain and written to an immutable ledger.  These concepts have been incorporated into other distributed ledger
technologies and have led to the distinction of building a blockchain and building upon a blockchain.
The emersion of blockchain-based applications is positive for the industry. Applications with novel use cases further demonstrate, and
validate, the technology’s ability to evolve beyond just a means of transferring value. However, these separate networks are becoming
disparate as they are isolated and able only to transfer data off chain or transfer value through centralized exchanges. In a sense, tiny
kingdoms with borders between economies and industries are being cemented. As the number of networks grow, the more disconnected
and sparse the industry becomes.
Just as in the early days of the internet, disparate blockchains networks have yet to truly realize the benefits of being connected. While
specialized blockchain networks will and should be developed, being able to communicate on chain to other networks offers significant
benefits, particularly if privacy and scalability can be maintained. A mechanism for joining disparate networks will unlock enormous value
for every participating network.

2.3                                                                                                                                            Aion: the third-generation blockchain
In the future, blockchains will federate data and value in a hub and spoke model similar to the internet.  The future of mainstream
blockchain adoption will be achieved by the development of a networked, federated blockchain to integrate these separate spokes. That
integrated blockchain network is Aion.
Aion is a third-generation blockchain network that will enable any private or public sector organization to:
•  Federate: Send data and value between any Aion-compliant blockchain and Ethereum.
•  Scale: Provide fast transaction processing and increased data capacity to all Aion blockchains.
•  Spoke: Allow the creation of customized public or private blockchains that maintain interoperability with other blockchains, but
allow publishers to choose governance, consensus mechanisms, issuance, and participation.
At the root of the Aion network is a purpose-built, public, third-generation blockchain called Aion-1. Designed to connect other blockchains
and manage its own robust applications, Aion-1 also provides the economic system that incentivizes interoperability in the ecosystem.
AION tokens are the fuel used to create new blockchains, monetize inter-chain bridges, and secure the overall network.

The Aion multi-tier blockchain network is like a computer network, providing a protocol and standard for dissimilar systems to com-
municate. However, in addition to information, the Aion network will pass logic and value among participating blockchains to create a
contiguous value chain where every transaction occurs on-chain, with logic and value passing among chains as freely as liquid assets.

These infrastructures, protocols, and concepts will work together to guarantee transmission from an origin to its destination through
interchain communication. The value of these technologies is that they enable one blockchain to transact with another blockchain, as
well as one blockchain to transact with every connected blockchain.

network. Connecting networks and interchain transactions provide a universal interface that enables blockchain developers and users
to route messages from one network to another. Specifically, a connecting network should provide the following core functionalities:
•  Route messages between different blockchain networks through a common bridging protocol that involves translation and prop-
agation of the message, which must be considered final.
•  Provide decentralized accountability.
•  Provide a bridging protocol.
Aion network protocols specify standards for the external components. While the actual functionality and internal components of each
connecting network might vary by vendor and intended purpose, these core functionalities should be implemented.
Point-to-point connections such as inter-blockchain relays or purpose-specific networks such as BTC Relay exist as central hubs. Such
protocols, while simple and efficient, often result in complicated state channels that can give rise to contentious situations and are often
at the mercy of one or a select group of individuals that run the relaying networks.
A connecting network instead uses bridges and a trust-free blockchain network to validate and ensure the correctness of flowing transac-
tions. By introducing a third party that routes messages from point A to point B, the networks themselves do not have to manage difficult
or unclear situations.
3.2                                                                                                                                             Interchain transaction
An interchain transaction is a trust-free message between blockchain networks, a critical infrastructure component powering interchain
communication. Interchain transactions allow any connected blockchain networks to exchange information, like computers on the inter-
net.
Interchain transactions are initially created on a source blockchain and then processed and forwarded by bridges and connecting net-
works before finally reaching the target blockchain. As stated previously, the creator of an interchain transaction must pay a transaction
fee for the communication cost using AION tokens, thereby incentivizing all the participants in each junction of the route.
Interchain transactions are designed to be somewhat analogous to packets by specifying the hops they should perform from the source
to target network, which potentially means passing through numerous connecting networks.
3.2.1                                                                                                                                           Format
Ideally, the interchain transaction format would include three parts:
•  Payload data that is specific to the creator and is typically regular transaction data, but potentially could be extended to arbitrary
data, at the discretion of the creator and the source network.
•  Metadata about the interchain transaction that contains routing information and fees.
•  Merkle proof that is only used when the sender wants to bypass the bridge.
The bridge and connecting network validators shall not interpret the data, but do check the integrity of the transaction as a whole. Privacy-
sensitive information applications could choose to encrypt the data if necessary.

The routing of interchain transactions is a multi-phase process. In each phase, the validators verify the transaction and reach consensus
on whether the transaction should be forwarded or rejected. If a transaction gets rejected at any point, any state change as a result of
the interchain transaction will be reverted, at least in the connecting network.
The routing path can be divided into two subpaths: the forward path and backward path. In the forward path, an interchain transaction
flows from the source chain all the way to the target chain. In the backward path, a confirmation of the interchain transaction is passed
back.

Figure 3: Depiction of an ICT lifecycle, beginning with emission from chain A, and ending with confirmation
If a bridge refuses to broadcast an interchain transaction for any reason, the sender may choose to pass the interchain transaction,
including proof, directly to the connecting network. The connecting network will validate the interchain transaction based on its knowledge
of a merkle hash chain of the participating network and broadcast it if valid.
The design of the interchain transaction is still under consideration and a detailed paper on the workings of interchain transactions will
be published as the project progresses.

to received.
•  If over two thirds of the bridge validators vote yes for the interchain transaction, the connecting network will change the state of
the interchain transaction to on hold, which will trigger an event where a corresponding connecting network token will be locked
until the transaction is processed.
•  If less than two thirds of the bridge validators vote yes for the interchain transaction, the state changes to rejected.

A bridge is a communication protocol that facilitates communication between the participating network and the connecting network. A
bridge is composed of its own distinct network of validators that assures translation of protocols and accountability between networks.
Bridges are directional; the source blockchain is the chain where transactions are emitted and the target blockchain is the chain where
the transactions are forwarded.
A bridge has two main responsibilities:
•  Signing and broadcasting an interchain transaction only if they have been sealed in the source blockchain and an interchain trans-
action forwarding fee has been paid.
•  Informing the connecting network of the merkle hash updates of the participating network.
Bridge validators will use a lightweight BFT-based algorithm to reach consensus. Transactions get approved only after receiving over two
thirds of the total votes (weighted).

Connecting networks are responsible for registering their directly-connected bridges. For each bridge, a dedicated table of validators will
be maintained on the blockchain, sorted by stake. Anyone can join a publicly-available bridge by pledging stake towards it. Specifically,
there is a contract or protocol whose purpose is to maintain a global bridge registration, which is updated dynamically as nodes join or
leave bridging networks.
For a bridge to be considered valid, a minimum total stake is required.  Only the topvalidators will be allowed to participate in bridge
consensus.

Multiple bridges may be generated when multiple groups of validators register for the same blockchain network using different identifiers.
From the perspective of the connecting network, these bridges are distinct, although they propagate and receive messages towards the
same network.
It is then the user’s responsibility to determine which bridge to use by specifying the target network identification. Here, the intent is to
drive an open market by incentivizing different bridging networks to compete in terms of stability, reputation, and pricing, with the goal
of an optimal fee value driven by market demands.

Bridge validators reach consensus by following a lightweight, BFT-based protocol where transactions are processed by one round instead
of multiple rounds. Each validator evaluates a transaction based on their view of the previous blockchain. An interchain transaction is
deemed valid if two thirds or more of validators voted yes, at which point the next blockchain considers the transaction valid.
Beginning at the start state, a bridge validator is required to wait until an interchain transaction is received and then verifies the validity
of signature and transaction fees. Based on the validity of the transaction, it is either dropped (not signed) by the validator, or signed and
propagated to the connecting or target network.

Bridge validators are rewarded from interchain transaction fees and potentially a portion of block rewards. The fee distribution aim is a
fair distribution policy.
Internally, all fees that go to a bridge are distributed to the bridge validators. This could be done either proportionally to the stake each
validator has put on the bridge or equally regardless of staking.
Externally, bridges share interchain transaction fees with other bridges on the routing path and with the connecting network validators.
There are two possible distribution models for external fees:
•  The sender of an interchain transaction specifies how the fees are distributed between bridges and the connecting network. The
advantage of this approach is that users have the option to optimize the fees based on the bridge load and minimum rates. The
drawback is that users need a basic understanding of the routing path and fee requirements of each bridge before sending the
transaction.
•  The sender only specifies the total fee and the bridge and connecting network shares this fee based on agreements or hard-coded
protocol. This approach has the advantage of being simpler for the user. The drawback of this approach is that changing the ratio
between bridge and connecting network is slow, if not hard.

One of the core concepts in the Aion network design is that it is dedicated to the federation of compatible blockchains or blockchain-
related networks. These can be purpose-specific blockchains, private networks, or consortium blockchains representing collections of
entities. Regardless of the context, the interconnectedness and the ability to interoperate in an efficient, secure, and transparent manner
increases the value of each network individually and also provides stability to the blockchain ecosystem in general.
A participating network is any network that has successfully implemented requirements to integrate with the connecting network. Par-
ticipating networks should be blockchains, but are not necessarily limited to such. Some useful participants could be oracles, cryptlets
[3], or database clusters in need of verifiable information. The only limitation is the flexibility of the participating network to integrate
with the connecting network. Once integrated with the Aion network, participating networks gain access to the communication protocol
(interchain transaction) specified earlier, enabling numerous possible use cases.
Participating networks have the full flexibility to customize different modules of their blockchain infrastructure including the consensus
algorithm, hashing algorithm, virtual machine (VM), and scripting languages.

Aion-compliant blockchains refer to the participating blockchains that comply with the Aion protocol and on which bridges can be estab-
lished easily to forward interchain transactions through Aion-1.
To be Aion-compliant, a blockchain must meet certain requirements including:
•  Be decentralized in some fashion and support procedures commonly found in blockchains such as atomic broadcast and transac-
tions. The exact implementation is left to the discretion of the bridging protocol and the network itself.
•  Be able to recognize interchain transactions as distinct from regular transactions.
•  Be aware of the consensus protocol used by the bridge and store a transaction deemed valid.
•  Implement locktime or a similar feature that allows tokens to be held by the network for a period of time.
Blockchain vendors will be able to adapt their offerings to be Aion-compliant. The Nuco blockchain infrastructure will be among the first
Aion-compliant networks.
More specific details on the requirements will be published as the project progresses.

Unlike Aion-compliant blockchains, existing blockchains are not designed to be interoperable. To enable interchain transaction routing
between the Aion network and existing blockchains, additional assumptions and/or compromises are required. In this section, we discuss
the possibility of connecting the Ethereum blockchain to the Aion network.
3.4.2.1                                                                                                                                         AION to Ethereum
As part of the bridge protocol, a lightweight BFT-based consensus algorithm is used by the bridge validators. In Aion connecting networks,
these BFT votes are natively aggregated and processed by the blockchain validators. The Ethereum blockchain does not have this built-in
functionality, so it needs an interchain transaction contract.
In this model, the interchain transaction contract will synchronize the public keys of bridge validators periodically, depending on the Aion
network specification. When an interchain transaction is requested, the bridge validators sign for it with their private key and send the
signature to the interchain transaction contract. The interchain transaction contract will collect all the votes (signatures) and provide a
provable record of the event that contains the interchain transaction data and voting information.  If at least two thirds of votes have
been received, the bridge validators will use the record as evidence when confirming the interchain transaction.
Because the computation cost of multi-signature verification is high in the Ethereum blockchain (3,000 gas for a single ECDSA), a higher
bridge fee is expected. To reduce this cost, a blockchain with full BFT functionality may be used in the bridge and only the outcome of
voting will be stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

Sending interchain transactions from the Ethereum blockchain to the Aion network is easier because of Ethereum’s programmable trans-
action size. Transactions intended for other blockchains will need to incorporate routing information in the data field.
There are two possible scenarios that can occur from an Ethereum interchain transaction (interchain transaction from the Ethereum
blockchain to the Aion network), depending on the receiving address. If the transaction is sent to an externally-owned account, the data
field can be used without modification. If the transaction is sent to a contract account, a workaround will be needed as the data is also
interpreted by the Ethereum VM. One approach for this would be appending the interchain transaction magic tag and routing information
to original call data, as long as the contract logic does not rely on the CALLDATASIZE op code.
To ensure transaction finality, the bridge may require additional block confirmations; typically major exchanges use 120 (half an hour) for
transaction confidence.

The Aion-1 blockchain is the genesis implementation of the connecting network. It is designed to be a fair, distributed, open blockchain ar-
chitecture that is capable of fulfilling the requirements specified in the multi-tier blockchain network architecture. As an open blockchain,
Aion-1 was designed with the following goals:
•  Connecting blockchains and external services (e.g., oracles and databases) together through the contiguous network and providing
accountable communication maintained through a decentralized network.
•  Providing the necessary infrastructure to develop high-performance, decentralized, inter-blockchain applications.
•  Creating a maintainable network through a robust and sustainable economic model.
Users will be able to deploy adjacent participating networks suitable for their own use cases and communicate with other networks
through an accountable routing architecture. Users ranging from large enterprises hosting consortium networks to community-oriented
open networks are all welcome to participate. In the future, decentralized applications could sit on top of the connecting network with
logic driven by integrating data from a multitude of blockchain networks.
In addition, the Aion-1 blockchain is equipped with a full-functioning economic system intended to drive the continued maintenance and
integrity of the network.

In this proposal, Aion-1 refers to the genesis, or first, implementation of a connecting network. The Aion-1 implementation also serves as a
fully-functioning blockchain architecture, comparable to state-of-the-art implementations found in today’s market. We envision Aion-1 to
be a standardized template that provides building blocks for future network implementations. Key components of the Aion-1 blockchain
include:
•  Consensus will be used to implement the proposed architecture of connecting two or more blockchains. Two variations of the BFT
protocol will be designed to reach consensus on the bridge and the connecting network:
-  Bridge consensus is a lightweight variation to reach consensus quickly on the bridge.
-  Connecting Network Consensus is a consensus protocol focused on providing stability at scale.
•  Aion virtual machine (AVM) is a custom-built, lightweight, performant, and stable VM that leverages key characteristics of the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM), providing concurrency and robustness within a blockchain-specific context. The AVM is responsible for
running applications on top of Aion-1. The AVM will include its own scripting language (further described below)

(BFT) algorithm combined with a hybrid protocol that aims for a fair representation of both parties in backing—partly through a token
system and partly through a novel verification algorithm based on concepts used in modern neural networks called proof-of-intelligence.
To meet operational scale and enable wide participation in the network validation process, Aion-1 will employ a representative validation
model similar to the delegated model explored by the BitShares team [4] and Lisk [5].  This validation model will allow Aion network
participants to back validators who actively participate in the consensus process, enabling a drastic increase of participation beyond what
conventional BFT algorithms would technically allow for. The specifics of the BFT-based protocol have not been finalized, but guarantee
the standard properties of liveness and safety. These assumptions are complemented by the representative selection approach in that the
network should be incentivized to select optimal and correct validators. Some implementations that we are investigating are HoneyBadger
[6], Tangaroa [7], and Stellar [8], with special interest in the proposal behaviour within HoneyBadger and the election protocols within
Stellar and Tangaroa protocols.
The conceptual design behind a representative network validation scheme is similar to that of a representative democracy in which can-
didates register themselves and are elected based on the votes they receive from their constituents. However, in this system, validators
must be supported by backers and each backer receives a share of the reward.  The rationale behind such a design is a belief in the
self-governance of the network where collective action of the network directly impacts the security of the network through proper voting.
To summarize, the consensus protocol being proposed is that every node in the network can submit themselves as a candidate and
pledge backing towards a candidate. At the start of every term, the highest-backed set of candidates are selected to be the validators for
this term. These validators contribute to the block generation process through a BFT-based protocol and are granted a distribution of
the block rewards for doing so. This is continued until the term ends and the next term begins, which restarts the process.

To provide context for the various aspects of representative consensus, refer to the following set of definitions that are used consistently
throughout the rest of the paper:
•  Nomination is the process by which a node can register to become a validator to participate in representative consensus on Aion-1.
Nomination must be completed before any other users in the network are able to pledge backing towards them.
•  Ranking is used to determine the nominated validators with the highest backing. This ranked list becomes the active set, which
means that the valiator node can contribute a vote towards the consensus process.
•  Active set is the tiered list of active validators. The number of validators in the active set.

backed validators. In the event of malicious behaviour or inactivity, the network looks towards this set for replacement validators.

directly impacts the ranking of validators on the active set. Additionally, backers are proportionally rewarded based on the rewards
of their validators. Backers consists of two distinct groups: stakers and solvers.

a static set of validators validates new blocks. At the end of every term, the active set is frozen to generate a new static set based
on changes in stake.

Any node can self-nominate and register to become a validator, but they require sufficient backing to actively validate on Aion-1. The
network maintains and refreshes between terms a network-wide repository of candidate validators, the nomination contract.
Validators become active through a continuous backing process by the network. The members of the active set are always the highest-
backed candidates. To facilitate this continuous backing process, there are two copies of the nomination contract at any point in time.
The live set is updated as network users back or withdraw their backing from the candidates and the static set exists only for the duration
of the term. The consensus protocol derives its active set from the static set. At the end of every term, the static set is overwritten with
the live set for the duration of the next term.
The validators will be able to set how their backers are compensated. So, the validator proposes the terms of its backing and, if those
terms are agreeable, backers will commit resources to that validator. This creates a balance of influence as the ranking (and subsequent

reward) for an active validator is based on the amount of backing it has compared to other validators.
There is also a reputation mechanism for validator nodes. Candidate validators can offer their reputation as a way to attract initial backing.
The exact features of reputation are being considered, but they will be quantitative, measurable, and well-defined. The intention is to
encourage all participants to consider becoming candidate validators, in addition to using the Aion-1 network for its inherent utility.

All users are required to present a certain amount of stake towards the network to be considered a candidate validator. However, the
rewards of a validator are not necessarily proportional to their stake. Instead, the ratio of rewards going to validator and backers are
proposed by the validator at the time of proposal to the nomination contract. The idea is for backers and candidate validators to arrive
at some market value that both parties agree on.
4.2.4                                                                                                                                            Tiered active set
Within the active set, the validators will be organized in a tiered structure. The tiered structure is ranked based on backing, in descending
order, from the highest-backed validator to the lowest. Each tier further incentivizes virtuous behaviour by providing a higher reward as
compensation. The idea is to encourage decentralization by introducing a cost-benefit equilibrium point for centralized backing, thereby
incentivizing backers to diversify.
The belief is this design will incentivize optimization and virtuous actions through interaction between participants. Validators will com-
pete to receive higher backing, and backers will benefit from backing validators, but only up until they are better compensated through
diversifying their backing, including backing inactive validators. One potential reward distribution scheme is as follows.

Referring to the reward scheme depicted in the Table 1, rewards are divided equally among the tiers (25%), then distributed to all validators
in those tiers. Validators in higher tiers have higher proportional rewards because of restricted tier sizes. A predefined reward introduces
an economic model for backers to evaluate the opportunity cost of backing validators, thereby incentivizing backers to distribute their
stakes amongst multiple validators (decentralization), or even nominate themselves as validators. The exact incentive model and structure
will undergo rigorous simulation testing.
4.2.5                                                                                                                                           Backing
Backing refers to either staking tokens or proof-of-intelligence towards a particular validator.  The network is designed to be a hybrid
network that emphasizes a duality of parties to properly distribute power and monetary value evenly across the network.  The belief
is that a purely staking-based network (proof of stake) creates a centralization of monetary value within a select group of individuals.
Therefore, an opportunity for another class of users, a class who do not possess the monetary value to participate in staking to contribute
to the network, are emphasized.
The backing algorithm is broken into two distinct categories:
•  Backing by staking
•  Backing by solving
These two factors combine to generate backing, a conceptual intermediate value used to determine the rank of a validator, as well as the
proportion of rewards given to a backer. In the following sections, each algorithm is discussed and the correlation between these three
variables is investigated.
4.2.5.1                                                                                                                                         By Staking
Backing through tokens is done through staking the tokens towards a particular validator. During the term ԉ։ , a user is able to stake
towards a certain validator Ԁ within ԉ։+1 . The implication of this is that the tokens are escrowed by the network until the end of ԉ։+1 ,
at which point the tokens are returned to the user (provided no malicious actions have occurred). Before that, a user can send another
message indicating that they would like the tokens to remain staked towards the same validator Ԁ .
Renewing the stake refers to the backer keeping the stakes with the validator. The concept of coinage could be a useful mechanism here
where the stakes have a half life. This would encourage liquidity and maintain competition between validators. In return for staking, the
backer receives a portion of the validators reward. The reward is proportional to the amount staked, as well as the current tier of the
staked validator.
4.2.5.2                                                                                                                                         By Solving
Another form of backing is done through solving a cryptographic puzzle, the exact details of which are explained in the proof of intelligence
section. A unique puzzle is generated per request and the puzzle must be solved through the proof-of-intelligence algorithm to generate
a proof of intelligence. The proof is then submitted to the network as proof of an amount of backing for a particular validator. Solvers
are also rewarded proportionally to the amount backed.

To incentivize a hybrid network, a certain distribution of stakes and proof-of-intelligence is needed.  This ratio is currently arbitrarily
designed to be 60/40 for stakes and proof-of-computes.  The total amount of stake and solutions is accumulated per term and the
backing ratio for the network is adjusted until it is consistent with the expected ratio. Therefore, having a greater proportion than the
expected ratio results in lower backing per stakes/proof of intelligence, and having a lesser proportion than expected results in a greater
amount of backing.
4.2.6                                                                                                                                          Incentives
The proposed system is designed to discourage bad actors or actions. However, some events may occur. In such events, the validator
will be demoted tiers or removed from the active set, preventing participation in consensus and any rewards for themselves and their
backers.
To discourage malicious backers, repercussions are dealt with by their method of backing. The consequences imposed by the network are
designed to eliminate opportunities for reward, rather than punishment by removal or redistribution of stakes among other validators. In
summary, this mechanism removes the zero-sum gain where one’s loss is another’s gain. Instead, it aligns motivations, and encourages
positive collective actions. The belief is that, with this system in place, the individual understands the consequences of their actions and
is incentivized to act in a virtuous manner and align with other virtuous actors. Bad actors will be identified by the network, and through
the validator’s decrease in reputation and backing, they receive feedback immediately and make corrective actions or are removed from
the active set.

•  Duplicitous Actions are punished by locking all stakes submitted by the validator for a period of time and immediately removing
the validator from consensus. The backers of the validator are punished depending on the method in which they supported the
validator.  Stakers are punished by locking their stakes for an extended duration.  Solvers are punished by the removal of the
validator from consensus, thereby rendering their proof-of-intelligence solutions invalidated.
•  Inactivity by a validator over a period of time is punished by demoting validators in the tier system. If the inactive validator is at
the lowest tier level, they are immediately dropped from consensus.
Replacement validators (the next highest ranked) are available and would immediately be shifted into the consensus process until the
end of the term.

Representative consensus leaves the responsibility of selecting the optimal validator nodes to the network. This process is difficult to
achieve unless there is a mechanism for the network to observe past behaviour of candidates and active validators. One option would
be to rely on external statistics to select the optimal candidate. However, there would be incentive to manipulate this data. Therefore,
a reputation system needs to be built within the network where past actions and statistics of a node are a part of the network protocol,
providing trust-less data to allow users to select their appropriate candidates. Some features that could be included in node reputation
include:

•  Uptime is the amount of time a node has been active on the network and is important when determining the age (and therefore
reliability) of a node.
•  Total backing is the total or aggregate amount of backing received up until that point in time and is summed up per end of term
(as stakes are locked in for that duration of time) and can indicate past performance for the node.
•  Centrality is used within the same context as it would be within a social network, would indicate which nodes are the most well
connected within the network, and could be a good indicator of reliability and performance.
•  Transaction origin refers to the first instance of a transaction appearing on the network (that was accepted into the blockchain)
and can easily be calculated with a requirement that nodes sign transactions they emit.
•  Network trust is a global network value for a particular peer that indicates the satisfactory behaviour of the peer from the per-
spective of the network. This was originally designed for P2P file-sharing systems [9], and has an algorithm that can be adapted to
consider parameters relevant to our use case.
These statistics are freely available to the user and an effort will be made for these statistics to be easily accessible through the internet.
This creates a knowledgeable user base that is necessary to form the basis of a democratic network.
Lastly, the reputation system is a mechanism that illustrates a node’s investment into the network. This investment is subject to conse-
quences of a node’s virtuous or malicious actions and is effective in assessing backing risk.

Proof of intelligence is an economic measure to deter denial of service attacks by requiring participants, solvers in Aion-1, to perform
artificial intelligence (AI) computation. The intent is to motivate the creation of AI-specific or specialized hardware that could be used for
machine learning and neural network training in the future.

The proof of intelligence works by requiring participants to train a predefined neural network so that it will output similar results to the
proposed ground truth (e.g., the hash of current block given the hashes of previous ԃ blocks as input). The parameters of the trained
neural network will serve as a proof that computation took place and is easy to verify by inputting the parameter and confirming the
results.

The validation of a proof is fast compared to the training process and is done in the following steps:
1.  Load the neural network as defined by the provided parameter vector.
2.  Feed the neural network with the hashes of previous ԃ blocks.
3.  Run and collect the outputs.
The validation process is being researched and developed.

The pooling of proof of intelligence is achieved by separating the parameter space into subspaces.  Similar to the pooling concept in
proof of work where each miner works on a range of the nonce space, proof-of-intelligence solvers work independently on a parameter
subspace. They share the proof and block reward.
4.3                                                                                                                                             Aion virtual machine (AVM)
The AVM architecture is designed to be a blockchain-specific solution with an emphasis on performance, determinism, and robustness.
The AVM is a customized lightweight JVM implementation tailored towards executing chain logic (application logic) within distributed
networks and hardened against scenarios that arise in such an environment.
The AVM provides the infrastructure for one of the primary functionalities of the connecting network, allowing the abstraction between
the blockchain and application-specific logic and paving the way to powerful interchain applications. The rationales of this design choice
and other considerations are expanded on in the upcoming sections.
4.3.1                                                                                                                                           Implementation
At the core of the AVM architecture is a lightweight, machine-friendly, blockchain-specific bytecode interpreter, after careful consideration
of practical and technical objectives. Implementation requires:
•  Performance that is close to native by using a set of machine-friendly instructions.
•  Stability of the AVM, achieved by using an isolated VM sandbox environment and carefully measuring the computation and re-
source usage.  New VM features will go through a formalized feature request and specification procedure, meaning that new
features are well-documented and tested before moving to the production environment.
•  Determinism for the AVM, guaranteed through a full-featured blockchain development kit as a replacement to any conventional
SDK. The proposed blockchain runtime environment would be built from the ground up with determinism as the major goal.
This is introduced in conjunction with the Aion VM, which only supports functionality built on top of the Aion blockchain runtime
environment within the native and bytecode context.
•  Compatibility will aim to be backwards, meaning that chain logic will always be valid and executable as the VM infrastructure
evolves.
•  Tooling from existing bytecode analysis can also be adapted to AVM bytecode. Leveraging this interoperability allows tooling that
would be suitable for mission-critical code such as chain logic.
The AVM leverages of significant existing research and development efforts. Additionally, using machine-friendly bytecode makes chain-
logic execution very efficient.
Customized means that the lightweight VM is configured for purposes of consumption metering (explained in the subsequent section)
and isolation from the host machine (network, file I/O, unfiltered system data). The isolated environment would ensure that no mean-
ingful information about the host machine and no unfiltered (non-oracle) communication takes place within chain logic. This is critical to
ensuring the safety of the host machine and the determinism of chain logic.
Users wishing to implement the program must submit a transaction with the necessary data (defined by some binary interface). Upon
receiving a message, the chain actor calls start() to initiate a boot-up sequence and accepts the data through accept(data). The logic then
processes the data, modifies its state, returns a response to the network, and calls stop() to initiate the shutdown sequence.

One of the key issues in a VM running on top of a publicly-accessible environment is the potential for misbehaviour through malicious
logic execution. In the presence of a turing-complete language, an expendable budget must be set so that the executing logic cannot
run indefinitely or behave in a fashion that may damage the host machine or disrupt the consensus mechanism through faulty timing
behaviours. Specifically, we define the budget mechanism as the limited consumption, which is a mechanism where an allotted value is
specified by usage, space, and bandwidth consumption of the executing logic.

Effectively, the logic execution would take place in an isolated or sandboxed environment. Within our context, usage refers to the CPU
usage allotted for this particular chain logic.  Space refers to the memory allocation initiated by the executing logic.  This prevents the
execution of code that uses a large quantity of memory. Bandwidth refers to the input and output consumption of the VM. With these
mechanisms in place, users executing logic would effectively rent the VM.
The protocols specify that using this mechanism requires the user to specify exactly the amount of resources given to the VM. From here,
one of two things may occur (both of which produce a response):
•  Successful logic execution and subsequent response
•  An exception in logic execution, either through exceeding the proposed resource bounds or through the logic itself
In the event of an exception in logic execution, the AVM will inform the network of the event through an ERROR response.
4.3.3                                                                                                                                         Chain-oriented concurrency model
Blockchain networks are classically considered very serial in usage; state changes and transactions occur in serial to provide the deter-
minism necessary for consensus. However, this creates a bottleneck in the amount of transactions that can be processed at any time
period. The solution to this lies in the idea of transaction parallelism. In particular, transactions must be implemented such that context
is given to the information about the state that they require. If this definition is formalized, a transaction scheduler can be implemented
that allows for deterministic parallel transaction execution.
From the perspective of the AVM, support for program-level concurrency, the parallel processing of multiple chain-logic programs, is
required. Towards this goal, the AVM is envisioned to be scalable, automatically clustering multiple VMs and scheduling contracts to be
processed by each in a deterministic manner.
4.4                                                                                                                                           Scripting Language
The Aion scripting language is used for writing chain logic that runs on Aion-1 and potentially any connecting/participating network. The
Aion language is compiled into AVM bytecode and executed by the AVM.
The Aion language provides the following features:
•  Defensive programming
•  Blockchain runtime environment
•  Blockchain context injection
•  Security
4.4.1                                                                                                                                         Specifications
The Aion language complies with a subset of the Java language specifications and is targeted for blockchain logic.  To accomplish this,
existing bytecode will be reviewed and possibly refactored to fit within the given context.
Additionally, the Aion language specifications include a blockchain runtime/development kit (BRE/BDK). The intent is to provide the de-
veloper with highly-optimized development libraries that implement blockchain-specific functionalities. These include but are not limited
to sending transactions, emitting events, retrieving blockchain related data, and communication between chain-logic applications. This
runtime environment is used to replace conventional development kits found in general compute purpose environments.  In general,
users of this language should expect the same syntactic structure, but a completely unique development kit.
4.4.2                                                                                                                                         Defensive programming
Defensive programming will be supported by the Aion language. According to past research [10], mistakes made by chain-logic developers
result from unexpected input data, runtime exceptions, and unexpected state change after reentrance. The Aion language will provide
mechanisms to decrease the possibility of these common errors. The mechanisms include:
•  Aion verifies the input data before passing it to a chain logic and validates the output data after the execution.

•  The scripting language introduces precondition, postcondition, and assertion to help programmers clearly organize their thoughts
into a defensive pattern.
•  Try/catch exceptions are fully supported by chain logic, emphasizing the handling of application state post exception rather than
state rollbacks
•  Bounds of array access are checked at runtime.
The addition of tooling provides the means of guiding the developer towards these mindsets, perhaps adding warnings and best practices
in areas where unprotected code is found. Other features will also be considered in the future.
4.4.3                                                                                                                                           Blockchain runtime environment
The blockchain runtime environment facilitates chain-logic execution by providing a deterministic library. This library is carefully tailored
to meet the determinism requirements of chain logic. Time access will be limited, using block time instead of current system time. Object
allocation will be implemented in a deterministic way so that memory address-based functions will continue to work (e.g., the default
hashCode() function). In addition, common utilities and algorithms will be carefully examined and included in the blockchain runtime
environment.
4.4.4                                                                                                                                           Blockchain context injection
Dependency injection is a technique whereby one object supplies the dependencies of another object. It allows a client, such as chain
logic in blockchain context, the flexibility to be configurable and hides the details of how the dependencies are provided.
Within the Aion scripting language, blockchain context and runtime information are considered dependencies. Any chain logic that re-
quires this information can declare the requirements through the use of annotations. As Aion develops, more resources will be added
to the injectable objects.
4.4.5                                                                                                                                           Security
The security of the Aion language is derived from the defensive nature of the language and the AVM where time, space, and resource
usage are strictly gauged and constrained. Additionally, security should be emphasized through the tooling provided for the scripting
language. For example, the logical correctness of Aion chain code can be provided by existing bytecode analysis, verification, and model
checking tools. Other examples include Java Pathfinder [12], FindBugs [13], and PMD [14].

The objectives laid out in this white paper are both ambitious and experimental. To approach this issue in a pragmatic manner, Aion-1
will be rolled out in an iterative manner, starting from existing technologies and gradually moving towards the intended objectives.
Aion-1 will be executed in three separate phases, with each phase focusing on different aspects of the technology and assembling the
building blocks while progressing towards the finalization of the network (phase 3). The exact deadlines for each phase and plans are
subject to change as options for each phase are investigated more thoroughly.
5.0.1                                                                                                                                           Phase 1
The focus of the first phase in the Aion release schedule is the interchain communication and bridging infrastructure. With this in mind,
phase 1 functionality will include:
•  Modified, high-performance EVM
•  Functioning bridging and interchain communication
•  Modified proof-of-work consensus algorithm

5.0.2                                                                                                                                          Phase 2
The second phase of the Aion release plan is targeted towards the migration from our modified EVM architecture towards the proposed
AVM architecture. Development priorities of this phase include:
•  Aion Virtual Machine
•  The Aion scripting language
•  EVM legacy codebase continued support
5.0.3                                                                                                                                          Phase 3
The third phase finalizes the envisioned network infrastructure, providing infrastructure for fast, efficient interchain communication and
interchain applications. In addition to the interchain functionalities from Phase 1, and the VM implementation from Phase 2, this phase
will introduce our representative consensus including the representative consensus algorithm.

The proposed solutions articulated in this paper are the result of several years of implementation and experimentation in the blockchain
industry.  The team behind Aion has been particularly close to several large-scale enterprise projects, where the challenges outlined
previously are significantly pronounced.  The Aion network is designed to overcome these challenges, and to propose a solution that
will enable blockchain applications to achieve their full intended potential. In our research and development of Aion to date, we were
fortunate to come across incredible findings and experiments from leading thinkers and researchers working on complementary concepts.
We’ve done our best to capture this and give credit in the references below.
As we continue on our journey to make Aion a reality, and to connect an ever-growing fragmented ecosystem of blockchains, we look
forward to engaging with you, and getting you involved.
