Legal disclaimer
Please note that we are in the process of undertaking a legal and regulatory analysis of our token
sale model and the intended utility of tokens and Holo fuel on the underlying platform. Following
the conclusion of this analysis, we may decide to amend the intended utility of tokens and/or
Holo fuel in order to ensure compliance with any legal or regulatory requirements to which we
are subject. To the extent that we make any such changes, we shall update the Green Paper and
publish a notice on our website together with the latest version of the Green Paper. It is your
responsibility to regularly check our website for any such notices and updates.
This green paper is for information purposes only and may be subject to change. We cannot
guarantee the accuracy of the statements made or conclusions reached in this green paper and we
expressly disclaim all representations and warranties (whether express or implied by statute or
otherwise) whatsoever, including but not limited to:

This green paper may contain references to third party data and industry publications. As far as we
are aware, the information reproduced in this green paper is accurate and that the estimates and
assumptions contained herein are reasonable. However, we offer no assurances as to the accuracy
or completeness of this data. Although information and data reproduced in this green paper are
believed to have been obtained from reliable sources, we have not independently verified any of the
information or data from third party sources referred to in this green paper or ascertained the
underlying assumptions relied upon by such sources.
As of the date of publication of this green paper, Holo’s ERC20 Tokens have no known or intended
future use (other than the anticipated conversion on Holo’s application in the form of Holo fuel).
No promises of future performance or value are or will be made with respect to Holo’s ERC20
Tokens, including no promise of inherent value, no promise of continuing payments, and no
guarantee that Holo’s ERC20 Tokens will hold any particular value. Unless prospective participants
fully understand and accept the nature of Holo’s business and the potential risks associated with the
acquisition, storing and transfer of Holo’s ERC20 Tokens, they should not participate in the Holo
ERC20 Token Sale. Holo’s ERC20 Tokens are not being structured or sold as securities. Holo’s ERC20
Tokens hold no rights and confer no interests in the equity of Holo. Holo’s ERC20 Tokens are sold
with an intended future functionality on the Holo application and all proceeds received during the
Token Sale (referred to as an Initial Community Offer in the green paper) may be spent freely by Holo
on the development of its business and the underlying technological infrastructure.

This green paper does not constitute a prospectus or disclosure document and is not an offer to sell,
nor the solicitation of any offer to buy any investment or financial instrument in any jurisdiction. Holo’s
ERC20 Tokens should not be acquired for speculative or investment purposes with the expectation
of making an investment return.
No regulatory authority has examined or approved any of the information set out in this green paper.
No such action has or will be taken under the laws, regulatory requirements or rules of any
jurisdiction. The publication, distribution or dissemination of this green paper does not imply that
applicable laws or regulatory requirements have been complied with.
Participation in Holo’s ERC20 Token Sale carries substantial risk and may involve special risks that
could lead to a loss of all or a substantial portion of your contribution. Further information about the
risks of participating in the Token Sale are set out in the Token Sale T&Cs. Please ensure that you
have read, understood and are prepared to accept the risks of participating in the Token Sale before
sending a contribution to us.
The Token Sale and/or Holo Tokens could be impacted by regulatory action, including potential
restrictions on the ownership, use, or possession of such tokens. Regulators or other competent
authorities may demand that we revise the mechanics of the Token Sale and/or the functionality of
Holo Tokens in order to comply with regulatory requirements or other governmental or business
obligations. Nevertheless, we believe we are taking commercially reasonable steps to ensure that
the Token Sale mechanics and issue of Holo Tokens do not violate applicable laws and regulations.
CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This green paper contains forward-looking statements or information (collectively “forward-looking
statements”) that relate to our current expectations of future events. In some cases, these
forward-looking statements can be identified by words or phrases such as “may”, “will”, “expect”,
“anticipate”, “aim”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “seek”, “believe”, “potential”, “continue”, “is/are likely to”
or the negative of these terms, or other similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking
statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on current projections about future
events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations,
business strategy, financial needs, or the results of the Token Sale.
In addition to statements relating to the matters set out here, this green paper contains
forward-looking statements related to Holo’s proposed operating model. The model speaks to our
objectives only, and is not a forecast, projection or prediction of future results of operations.
Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analysis made by Holo in light of
its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future
developments and other factors it believes are appropriate, and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Although the forward-looking statements contained in this green paper are based upon what we
believe are reasonable assumptions, there are risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors
which could cause Holo’s actual results, performances, achievements and/or experiences to differ
materially from the expectations expressed, implied, or perceived in forward-looking statements.
Given such risks, prospective participants in the Token Sale should not place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements.

Context: Bridging Crypto to Mainstream
Holo is a bridge to link our advanced crypto technology, Holochain, and everyday users. This
document explains how Holo works and the business model and funding that support it. Holochain
delivers on the dreams of making decentralized computing easy and real. It provides the underlying
cryptographic fabric to maintain data integrity across unlimited peers without requiring consensus.
Integrity without consensus means:
●   immediate and efficient processing,
●   no proof-of-work,
●   no proof-of-stake,
●   no energy wasted on mining,
●   no bottlenecks nor global delays.
In fact, Holochain is so efficient that you can run over 50 full nodes on a cell phone or a $35
Raspberry Pi computer. Holochain even enables scalable crypto-accounting to build new
generations of asset-backed and value-stable cryptocurrencies.
Programmers can leverage our RAD tools (Rapid Application Development) to quickly build fully P2P
web applications designed to operate on the scale of Twitter or Facebook with no centralized data
centers or infrastructure. Each user just brings their own device to share a small amount of
computing and storage.
Holochain meets the demands of people who want to:
●   own their own data,
●   control their identity,
●   have automatic backups,
●   customize their user experience,
●   choose how to connect their applications,
●   decide with whom to share their private information,
●   and transact without dependence on banks or governments.
Despite all these benefits, people don't adopt technology just because it’s good. Most stick to the
convenient and comfortable. So, that's why we're launching Holo.
Only some people are ready to install and experiment with next-gen crypto software like Holochain,
but for the apps built on this vanguard to be viable, they still need to reach mainstream Internet
users. Holo lets people use their web browser and existing payment systems to interact with
decentralized crypto-apps and currencies, providing a bridge from Holochain's fully peer-to-peer
world of the future back to the semi-centralized world of today.
Early adopters can use a Holo hosting box to host their own apps and data and earn Holo fuel for
sharing extra space and computing power to host apps for others. Instead of burning computation on
mining, Holo Hosts get paid for providing hosting to mainstream users who just use their browser
instead of installing Holochain.
Most crypto projects tout the fulfillment of crypto-anarchist ideals of total decentralization and
automation of agreements, yet fail to provide an easy path for normal people to reach those ideals.

Holo is a pragmatic compromise — a bridge for people to transition toward greater and greater
decentralization and autonomy. But since Holo must interface with the centralized systems of today,
some parts of it are also centralized. So this is not a typical crypto project or paper. We've already
built a fully distributed platform in Holochain. Now we want to take it to the mainstream. Holo is the
bridge to get there.
Introduction
This paper sets out multiple interdependent innovations that work together to enable a large shift in
the landscape of crypto applications and currencies. After a brief overview to provide context for
these innovations, we explain each:
1.                                                                                                       Technological Innovations: Scalable P2P applications on Holochain,
2.                                                                                                       Technological Innovations: Hosting P2P apps for mainstream users,
3.                                                                                                       Currency Innovation: Double-Entry Crypto-Accounting system for rewarding Hosts,
4.                                                                                                       Business Model Innovation: Leveraging excess capacity using Sharing Economy principles,
5.                                                                                                       Funding Innovation: Bonding ICO with Crowdfunding to demonstrate real demand and
establish stakeholders in an ecosystem backed with real world assets.
These innovations weave together to form a coherent approach. In order to have a self-regulating
ecosystem hosting distributed applications, we need an accounting method that improves efficiency
as it scales so we can reward hosts in the sharing economy of the ecosystem which is created by
inviting all stakeholders to participate in the system through our ICO (Initial Community Offering)
which provides the right to purchase hosting services.
Overview of Holo Ecosystem
The Holo ecosystem relies on hosts that provide processing and storage for distributed applications
while earning redeemable credits.

Hosts
Holo takes hosting of sophisticated social applications out of centralized data centers to the edges of
the Internet where our devices live. It makes self-scaling infrastructure a reality through peer-to-peer
architecture, which automatically performs load-balancing and load-sharing across thousands or
even millions of peers.
Holo enables hosts to turn a consumer-grade mini-computer into a source of revenue, where they
get paid for hosting distributed applications. Hosts choose what apps to serve, and set their own
hosting prices and priorities.
Holo is where the crowd becomes the cloud.
Distributed Apps
Some of the most popular apps today are made in a way that already needs Holo. Using Holo would
mean that Wikipedia wouldn't have to keep doing fundraising, or social apps like Twitter wouldn't
have to struggle for a revenue model while pushing advertising to fund massive infrastructure.
Imagine if the more popular an app became, the more hosting power it received from new users
installing the app and sharing the load.
What if developers could build distributed applications in familiar languages like JavaScript? What if
they could use Rapid Application Development tools to orient themselves to the process, with ready
tools for testing apps for scalability and vulnerabilities? These are some of the ways we're making the
road to a distributed internet easy, while incentivizing thousands of hosts to support the process.
Credits
Hosts are paid in Holo's crypto-credits, called Holo fuel, which are efficiently designed to transact a
high volume of micro-transactions. The value of hosting credits stays stabilized because they're
backed by a valuable modern asset: computing power. As more hosts come online and share
computing power, the network becomes more valuable, giving the credits more purchasing power in
relation to the service they are designed to support.
Holo fuel functions by enabling the long-proven standardized practice of double-entry accounting
with layers of cryptographic assurance on top of it. Both parties in a transaction sign the transaction
to each other’s account chains, and these transactions are validated by peers on a shared DHT
(distributed hash table).
Holo provides a crypto-accounting infrastructure audited and notarized by the network.
Payment Flow
A common payment flow might be as follows: (See diagram below.)

                                                                                                          payment (dollars, euro, Ether, Bitcoin, etc.) remains held in a Reserve Account, which enables
                                                                                                          that account to transfer the credits to the App Provider’s account.
2.                                                                                                        Host generates signed service logs as they field requests and provide responses to people
                                                                                                          accessing the app through their web browsers.
3.                                                                                                        Host submits a Proof-of-Service invoice to the App Provider when they accumulate a chunk
of hosting in their log.
4.                                                                                                        App Provider pays the Host in hosting credits after validating the Proof-of-Service.
5.                                                                                                        Host might opt to cash out their hosting credits from the Reserve Account where the
original payment was made. Cashing out will be in cryptocurrency initially: As we grow we
will work with appropriate regulators to determine the best way to include national currency
cash out.
6.   A Host can only cash out credits earned for hosting.
In the future the micro-transaction flows for hosting payments could also undergird a general
purpose cryptocurrency payment system in a similar way that “gas” powers the Ethereum transaction
engine. The Holo organization will take a tiny portion of each transaction, detailed in the revenue
model section on page 20. Initially this will be for hosting transactions only. We will work with local
authorities before opening up general transactions to the Holo community.

1. Tech Innovations: Scalable Applications
Scalable dApps
Holochain provides the underlying cryptographic fabric with data sharing and validation protocols
that enable massive peer-to-peer applications. The agent-centric approach to computation 1removes
the need for consensus, eliminating synchronization bottlenecks.
Rather than thinking of Holochain like blockchain, it may be better to think of it like git repositories for
each agent which can be published, shared, synchronized or merged via a BitTorrent-like DHT
(Distributed Hash Table). The provenance of all shared data is strictly enforced and the structure,
content, and its compliance with shared application rules are validated by randomized peers. 2
Comparing Blockchain and Holochain
The following chart offers a comparison between several aspects of blockchain and Holochain in
terms of approach, energy usage, volume, scalability, platform and efficiency. This summary can help
a developer or community determine whether Holochain or blockchain is the right platform for their
application. The efficiency and scalability of Holochain drives the benefits of energy use and
transaction volume.

Please consult the Holochain white paper 8for a more thorough understanding of its architecture. At
the time of publication, Holochain is already in Alpha release with a number of important early
applications (such as a distributed Twitter-clone, and distributed public key infrastructure), which
have been designed to demonstrate its scalability and usability.
While Holochain is a critical innovation, we created the bridge back to the world of the web through
Holo (a technology built on top of Holochain) to reach mass market.
2. Tech Innovations: Hosting P2P Apps for Mainstream
Users
Holo extends P2P applications to the web by bridging into existing Internet architectures. Specifically
this means generating web gateways, providing DNS resolution across thousands of peers, and
virtualizing Holochain’s cryptographic fabric to operate partially on host machines and partially on
end-user’s web browsers.
Distributed application hosting is no simple task, and it only becomes possible by the unique way
that Holo weaves all of these innovations together along with the cryptocurrency incentives to drive
hosting.
Holo will be able to perform competitively with hosting of web applications outside of the crypto
space. The following chart compares Ethereum, Holo, and Amazon Web Services as an example of
centralized cloud hosting.

For hosting, AWS has many strengths, specifically efficiency, price, and risk reduction. Holo, while
competitive, differentiates itself primarily through distributing hosting services throughout the
network. This approach avoids the increasing concerns with issues of centralization:
●   Network agents’ interactions are mediated by third parties.
●   Centralized data storage and proprietary permissions make user data an easy target for
government audits; security breaches; surveillance by privileged actors; and undisclosed
sales, distribution, and manipulation.
●   Ownership of user and network data is held by web platforms.
●   Unreliable for zero-latency requirements where local synchronizing data is needed, e.g. IOT,
self-driving cars.
With Holo, those challenges are addressed by distribution, rather than centralization, of storage and
processing across the network. However current approaches to distributed services bring their own
challenges:
●   Consistency, Availability, and Partitioning
●   Approaches using unified data sets creates two major inefficiencies:
○   High computational overhead for data-centric consensus.
○   Creates the additional challenge of having to manufacture universal time sequence
across disparate clocks and network delays.
Holochain addresses these challenges by providing an agent-centric, relativistic frame to establish
underlying data integrity such that applications can resolve the occasional collision of rival data sets
by means appropriate to the social context of that app.

3. Currency Innovation: Double-Entry
Crypto-Accounting
Designing a currency to support the Holo ecosystem required us to meet several challenging criteria.
These criteria demanded an efficiency far beyond current cryptocurrency and at a micro-scale that
traditional transaction fees prohibit. These were the design constraints for Holo’s currency system9:
●   Must cost less in computing cycles and in fees than the original computing and funds being
counted.
●   Must support millions of transactions per second and account for service provision in
batches, surpassing financial exchange backbones like the Visa network, which has a
maximum estimated capacity of 56,000 transactions per second.
●   Must optimize market value of its units in relation to cost of hosting, for a steady and stable
trajectory, preferably growing in value over time.
We solved these issues through crypto-accounting where credits are backed by a real-world asset:
hosting as well as through selective automation, our approach to smart contracts (described further
on page 18). The solution requires abandoning tokens altogether 1 and focusing on accounting. While 0
double-entry accounting is ancient, bringing it forward into cryptocurrency is an innovation that
solves the design constraints needed for Holo to responsibly handle a massive transaction volume at
scale.

Crypto-Accounting rather than Cryptocurrency
Holo fuel is not a crypto-token or cryptocoin, but a mutual credit accounting system where every
transaction is countersigned on the local chains of both counterparties. This allows us to design the
crypto-credits to forge new patterns of social and market behaviors that have not previously been
utilized for cryptocurrencies.
In particular, we are optimizing Holo fuel to function as a medium of exchange currency, rather than
a store of value currency. To build a thriving crypto-economy, credits need to circulate rather than be
12
retained as a speculative investment.
There are several important characteristics of Holo fuel:
●   It is asset-backed.
●   It does not use tokens or coins.
●   Transactions are counter-signed by both parties.
This enables a currency supply that breathes, so it can be value-stable without being value-static.
Asset Backed
Tokens are issued by fiat: they come from nothing, and can really only be spent. A currency is
backed by something when it can be redeemed for that thing.
Technically "redemption" is different than "spending." If you have a local currency backed by dollars,
when you redeem it for dollars, the currency you redeem has left circulation, and the reserve of
dollars has been diminished, and the reserve must be expanded again to issue more of the local
currency.
Holo has a huge negative balance when this system starts because funds raised in the ICO are
credited from the Holo Infrastructure Provider account. Also the Reserve Accounts (all initially
managed by Holo) are always negative because these accounts are debited for the credits people
purchase (with outside funds now held on reserve).
There are two ways Holo gets paid for hosting:
1.                                                                                                        For hosting provided directly from Holo's servers (minimal), Holo is paid credits. These come
from someone's positive balance reducing Holo's negative balance, hence taking those
credits out of circulation in exchange for hosting.
2.                                                                                                        For hosting provided indirectly by the network of hosts, it is paid in outside currencies
(reserved for hosts). When a host redeems their Proof-of-Service credits, they spend from

positive balance, reducing a Reserve Account's negative balance, taking those credits out of
circulation.
Since the credit limits on the system are directly connected to providing hosting power (whether
extended to hosts or Holo), and then redeemed against those negative balances, the system is
backed by that asset.
No tokens. No coins.
Instead of being token-centric, which requires computational overhead invested in establishing
consensus, Holo is agent-centric. In an economic context, this upgrade leverages traditional
double-entry accounting by using cryptographic signatures committed to immutable chains as
accounts. In this method, instead of managing a global ledger of coins, each agent (or user, or
account) manages its own local chain of transactions. This means that each person’s balance is
encoded on their own chain, so when two people transact, they only need to audit their counterpart’s
history to be sure they have the credits they’re spending. One party’s balance goes up, and the other
party’s balance goes down, in equal measure. Every credit has an offsetting debit. They need
neither permission nor consensus from anyone who is not party to the transaction.
Countersigned Transactions
The counterpart’s signature locks the record from being edited afterwards, which also effectively
makes all prior content in the chain immutable. This immutable history enables anyone to quickly
calculate someone’s balance and audit their history by replaying their transactions to confirm
signatures and changes in balance.
As an example, Alice agrees to sell hosting to Bob for some Holo fuel. They communicate with each
other via node-to-node messaging to build a transaction for a two-phase commit process. Each entry
in someone's local chain is connected by signed headers.
One party initiates the transaction, leaving blank the fields the counterparty must complete. Each
agent exchanges the data required to validate the other’s state. This involves each retrieving and
auditing the other’s chain to confirm that they are in a valid state to complete the transaction (for
example, the buyer has the credits they’re spending). The person receiving funds indicates their
approval by building a pre-flight header for their chain and sending it to the buyer. When the sender
responds with their header, they both commit it to their own source chains with the record of the
counterpart’s signature in the header they provided.
Note that BOTH parties actively participate in the transaction and must sign it to their chains. This is
not the spending of a coin by a single keyholder, but a mutually agreed-upon transaction with the
opportunity to validate the other party’s state before transacting with them. All nodes have the same
validation rules, so if Alice can’t validate that Bob can spend the credits he’s wanting to spend, then
her app will reject the transaction. It doesn’t matter if others before her colluded with Bob. Every
non-colluding actor will reject illegal operations. Bad actors, in this sense, can have no effect on
legitimate users nor on the currency or its supply.
14




Breathing Currency Supply
Since all valid transactions are double-entry accounting entries, Holo’s internal crypto-accounting
functions just like a balance sheet 1where every transaction keeps the sheet in balance. Every credit 3
has an offsetting debit. Nobody ever gets to create something from nothing. There is no minting,
mining, or burning of coins. This means the sum of all the positive balances is always equal to the
sum of all the negative balances.
When no coins exist, and a matching debit for every credit is always required, managing the currency
supply is fundamentally different. The simple reason for this is that the net currency supply is always
ZERO.
There are two primary ways the currency supply breathes:
1.                                                                                                         Through the many small credit limits (explained further, later in the document) of accounts
providing the assets (hosting power, app development, app provision) which back the value
of the credits, and
2.                                                                                                         Through a few larger credit limits of Reserve Accounts and the Infrastructure Provider.
Think of operating a value-stable cryptocurrency a bit like building and maintaining a bridge.
●   The Reserve Accounts are the stanchions initially suspending the weight of perceived value.
●   The Infrastructure Provider are the engineers and construction crew, they need capital for the
materials and ongoing revenue for the maintenance.
●   The key players in the app ecosystem (hosts, app providers, and developers) are the road
with their credit limits being the expansion joints in the sections of concrete.
You don’t achieve stability without all these parts working together — and without flexibility designed
into the right places, the whole thing is too brittle and it collapses. To achieve value stability of a
currency you must establish feedback loops which keep supply and demand in dynamic balance.
Value Stable — Not Value Static
The most critical component in the value stability of Holo fuel is the fact that it is backed by a vital
modern asset: computing power. Estimated 2017 revenue for cloud hosting is $264 billion dollars 14
Holo’s credits are not cryptographic tokens divorced from any specific value, they are integral to the
operation of a large-scale computing infrastructure.
Holo fuel is priced in computing units: processing time, bandwidth, and storage. It is available for
purchase from Holo as well as the whole community of hosts. It is also redeemable across that
whole community for computing power. Even though credits can also be used for general financial
transactions, as the number of hosts grows, that mass of their computing power stabilizes valuation.
Hosts set their own prices for their computing power which will tend toward stability when averaged
across a large ecosystem of servers distributed across the planet.
Another feedback loop stabilizing the price is the fact that Holo hosting is feasible on commodity
hardware. 1If the price of Holo fuel rises significantly, people are incentivized to connect more 5

computing power to the network. And since trades on exchanges are not likely to deviate wildly from
the prices for which people can buy computing power, this incentivization structure places a
decentralized throttle on massive price pumps. This grounding in the delivery of a real world asset
with practical value provides a substantial center of gravity for the price of Holo fuel.
Value-stable does not mean static — there is no external value reference to fix a price to. External
currencies fluctuate in value too much for credits to be pegged to any one thing. Also, the value of
credits is still dependent on real world factors like the cost of electricity, computing hardware, and
Internet connectivity. Variations of account balances moving closer and further from their credit limits
enable small changes in the supply to strengthen immunity to wild fluctuations and
16
pump-and-dump manipulations.
Participating with Holo fuel
Hosting System — Roles and Responsibilities
Holo fuel is designed to power distributed applications operated by a network of hosts who provide
computing power. Therefore, specific roles and responsibilities are defined within this system. Most
of these roles can be stacked such that an agent (a node with private/public keys and the ability to
interact with Holo and its hosted applications) may hold multiple roles. The exceptions to this rule are
Reserve Accounts and the Holo organization, which acts as an Infrastructure Provider.
End-User Participant
An end-user accesses crowd-hosted applications via standard web browsers, so their defining
characteristic is that they have not installed Holochain. Holo is designed to help such end-users
reach their applications, keep their data out of centralized services, and make it safe and easy to do
crypto-transactions. Like all user roles, major rights and responsibilities involve following the rules
encoded in the Holo app DNA, which may include payment of transaction fees when they
accumulate to the payment threshold. End-users are constrained in using credits in several ways:
●   End-users cannot have a negative balance.
●   End-users can participate without credits if hosts or app providers do not require credits or
the end-user provides enough hosting for their own.
●   Should the application require credits from an end-user they would acquire credits through
the Reserve Account, or other non-affiliated sources. End-users can only spend credits which
are part of their positive balance.
●   End-users spend credits as described previously.
Host
Hosts can set their own priorities and filters by app categories, price brackets, and usage demands. If
a Host doesn’t have much time or interest in such choices, they can enable an app selection
autopilot. Autopilot is a good way for Hosts to increase their revenue by bringing capacities online as
needed. Hosts who don’t want to pay much attention to pricing can also configure an auto-pricing
16 Described by the SEC here.
16




app. They can set basic priorities such as trying to serve the greatest demand, seeking the highest
payers, or adjusting toward a middle-of-market zone to get hosting volume that is optimal instead of
overwhelming. Hosts can also set their own prices. Some may opt to host certain applications for free
— if, for example, a Host is passionate about a public-interest project, like a P2P Wikipedia, SETI, or
Genome Mapping project. Some people may choose higher thresholds than others, depending on
their sensibilities for profit, risk, philanthropy, etc.
Once a Host has three months of hosting records they will receive a credit limit proportional to their
hosting revenue. The credit algorithm includes anti-gaming mechanisms to deter faking transactions
intended to inflate one’s credit limit. A Host’s credit may not be identical to their hosting revenue, but
it will be quite close. The credit limit is expanded based on the notion that earned hosting revenue
indicates future capacity to repay a negative balance.
●   Hosts acquire credits in exchange for their processing and storage services, by buying them
from the Reserve Account, or by providing non-affiliated services.
●   Hosts are the only actors on the network able to redeem credits through the Reserve
Account. Their ability to redeem is specific to credits earned through processing and storage
services for the Holo network, and is not available for credits acquired through other means.
Application Provider
App Providers are responsible for the maintenance and security of apps they publish on Holo. They
also agree to timely payment of Proof-of-Service invoices. Since unpaid invoices are visible to all, it is
easy enough for a Host to demonstrate a failure to pay. No central authority needs to intervene, and
no smart-contract needs to enforce payment.
If an App Developer sets up subscription, product, or service payments to be received in Holo, they
will have access to a variant of the credit algorithm used by Hosts. Many apps may take payments in
traditional currencies, and would not qualify for credit from such activity, but they can use that cash
to purchase hosting credits from Holo Reserve Accounts, which would then be held on reserve for
redemption by Hosts. Application Providers are constrained in using credits as follows:
●   They acquire credits by purchasing them from Holo Reserve Accounts.
●   The Application Provider cannot redeem credits, only spend them for services on the
network.
Application Developer
Developers can complete development bounties offered in Holo, giving them access to a variant of
the credit algorithm offered to Hosts. This will likely be only a small portion of the ecosystem.
●   Application Developers also acquire credits by purchasing them from Holo Reserve
Accounts.
●   Credits received for application development cannot be redeemed, only spent for services
on the network.
Infrastructure Provider
17




The Holo organization itself runs the Holo Application Delivery Network to manage bridging from the
web to Holochain. With the support of Reserve Accounts, it also runs the asset-backed, mutual-credit
currency and manages value flows between various parties (including allowing Hosts to convert
Holo fuel to other currencies).
●   The Infrastructure Provider acquires credits through fees of no more than 1% taken from all
Holo fuel transactions.
Reserve Accounts
The Holo organization is also a special class of user with an initial credit limit large enough to credit
all the pre-sale purchases from their account. That limit is calculated from a valuation algorithm for
the infrastructure services based on actual growth and demand (numbers of hosts, applications,
users, etc.). Transaction fees should cover most of the costs of operation and maintenance, so this
line of credit is to capitalize system improvements. Therefore, any significant expansions of supply
would also be correlated to enhancing the value and capacity of the network.
Holo holds Host earned credits under reserve so that there is liquidity to exit Holo fuel. Initially Holo
will be the only Reserve Account. To perform its role adequately the Reserve Account must be
transparent and demonstrate proof of funds and ongoing receipt and disbursal of funds.
General Purpose Transfers and Transactions
Initially Holo will only support hosting services and so support hosting transactions only. Eventually
Holo needs to be able to support general purpose transfers and transactions that are not just hosting
transactions. Here are some basic examples of why:
●   An App Provider has a few apps hosted on Holo. To maintain clear accounting records they
maintain separate accounts for each app. App X is their main breadwinner which brings in lots
of subscription revenue in Holo fuel. They make periodic transfers from App X to the
accounts of App Y and App Z to cover the hosting fees.
●   A host has multiple devices with each one earning credits in that device’s account. They
would like to pool their credits into one account to make a large purchase.
●   An App Provider needs to pay an App Developer for services.
●   An App Developer needs to pay a subcontractor for development services.
We will work with local regulators to make sure   we are operating in accordance with local laws
before making the general purpose transactions possible. These transactions, as described above,
are required for the hosting ecosystem to run smoothly.
Selective Automation: Holo Governance
Holo provides the informational feedback loops needed for good decision-making rather than
replacing people’s freedom to choose. Automating things in a Holo application is easy, and blending
18




automation with better information for making decisions is more resilient. Holo provides information
to facilitate the following in its internal hosting market:
●   Hosts can be selected by Application Providers based on quality information in their
performance records. 17
●   Hosts can accept or reject Application Providers based on reputation for payment.
●   Application Providers receive good information about the service provided by Hosts.
The most fundamental “terms and conditions” of the system are the code written into the Holo app
DNA. However, Holo is also a hosted commons with expected standards of behavior. The full
complement of social agreements simply cannot be encoded into smart contracts. Instead, it can
facilitate better collective intelligence and healthy feedback loops that enhance people’s ability to
choose who they trust, while detecting unexpected or unpredictable cheating and fraud.
All types of users are incentivized not to defraud others on the system with the understanding that
when they are caught all privileges on Holo may be revoked. Keep in mind that EVERY
communication and data element is signed by its author to their immutable chain, or it cannot
propagate. If someone acted badly, their actions would be published on a non-repudiable record of
their actions, meaning that their digital fingerprints are all over the scene of the crime and their chain
would be rejected in the next transaction.
This enables the Holo ecosystem to have a high-functioning “immune system,” because any node
can create a “warrant” which flags fraudulent behaviors and provides the original signed records of
the fraudster as proof. As new types of fraud are identified and able to be detected, it is easy to
determine who has already done those things, then spread warrants as proof of fraud, so other nodes
can opt to blacklist them.
Another agreement for all Holo users is to not generate wasteful, automated, or artificial traffic (to
boost one’s own or a conspirator’s hosting fees). If a developer needs to test app scalability they
must do that on Holochain or on a distinct Holo testing network where test nodes (likely supplied by
app providers and developers) agree to provide each other free computing space purely for the
purposes of testing their apps for vulnerabilities and scalability.
For a complex ecosystem of relationships, it is far superior to have safe settings for default behaviors,
and then enable people to choose to replace those settings with their own thresholds or make their
own special exceptions. Because of the scale of the system (both micro-transactions and large
volume), automating certain functions is crucial. Thus there is a small set of roles and processes for
interactions. The Currency White Paper provides elaborations of the types and operations of
automatable processes: pre-authorization credits, Proof-of-Service invoices, and transaction fees (a
special instance of the structure used for pre-authorization).
17 Peers on the DHT keep statistics about their neighbors so they know how to manage the neighborhood. The
activity from the gossip protocols, to identify percent uptime, latency, and bandwidth/sync speeds. Holoquery
also reports sustained failures of a host to service Holo requests so they can be lowered in the DNS rotation.
App providers do statistical analysis on service logs If a node is generating fraudulent billing or artificially
inflating their charges, the app provider will flag this as a trust incident, and likely block that host (for that app
only). Being blocked/flagged on apps could be an indicator a node may not be able to be trusted.

4. Business Model Innovation: Leveraging Excess
Capacity Using Sharing Economy Principles
In much the same way that Airbnb leap-frogged hotel chains with minimal capital requirements by
leveraging spare space in people’s homes, Holo can compete with existing cloud hosting companies
without significant physical infrastructure or capital investment. In the crypto space, when it comes to
actually scaling distributed applications or reaching mainstream users with them, there is almost no
competition yet.
The Larger Value Proposition
Holochain is a generalized crypto application engine. This means we can fulfill on the promises of
many other major crypto projects. Between built-in functionality, applications already built, and
applications that are in progress for near-term completion, we solve many of the most pressing
problems in the crypto space including decentralized storage, scalable decentralized applications,
and secure decentralized identity.
We believe that to efficiently deliver on these promises, at scale, a radical rethink is required. Our
solution to this is Holochain and Holo powered by the five innovations in this paper. Over $5 billion
has gone toward other projects to provide largely a subset of the functionality we have already built
or we expect to bring online in the 2018.

By keeping the focus on the security and scaling of a cryptographic application engine, Holochain
can foster a massive ecosystem of distributed application projects much larger than anything seen in
this space so far. When you add to that the ability of Holo to make these applications available to
mainstream users in their web browser, that creates an even greater multiplier on the reach and
value for the whole ecosystem.
The Revenue Model for Holo
To have a thriving crypto-economy on Holo, the credits need to be actively circulating, not parked
with everyone hoping for future market cap increase. Therefore, the revenue is tied to transaction
fees, rather than outside trading value of a token. This incentivizes us to attract lots of applications,
many hosts, and to maintain a value stable currency to encourage the use of Holo fuel above and
beyond hosting.
Here are a few basic scenarios showing how this may play out:
1.                                                                                                          Something better beats us to market and none of this gets traction. While possible, this
seems unlikely since we’re already to Alpha on Holochain. In some domains, there are claims
that certain functionality is impossible, yet we already have it working.
2.                                                                                                          We make it first to market, but have some critical bug/failure that negatively impacts the
Holochain brand and so we lose critical time and credibility while fixing the bugs. We believe,
just like with DAO and Ethereum, as long as we are transparent and diligent in working
towards a world where Holochain and Holo exist we can overcome critical bugs/failures.
3.                                                                                                          We fail to deliver on the promises of the crowdfund or ICO due to delays in boxes, not
enough hackathon demand, or not enough demand for Holo and so Holochain apps don’t
reach the mainstream.
4.                                                                                                          Holo makes it to market, but users are actually afraid to jump from centralized to fast and
scalable dApps. This also seems unlikely as blockchain has primed the market for these
solutions, but has not been able to scale. In this scenario, Holo starves from inadequate
transaction revenue and needs to restructure to generate other revenue sources.
5.                                                                                                          Holo grows a thriving dApp ecosystem. In this scenario we look toward the revenues and
profitability of cloud hosting — rapid growth, a market in the hundreds of billions. Given how
easy it is to build crypto apps in our framework to solve significant challenges (see
comparison chart of over $5B put into solving problems we already solve), this seems to be a
viable path. Participants in our ecosystem are well rewarded for their work: Holo transaction
21




revenue on a small corner of this market will be more than adequate for infrastructure
maintenance, innovation, and growth, plus small trading volume on Holo fuel as a general
use currency when it becomes open for this use.
6.   Holo explodes into a massive crypto ecosystem for dApps and asset-backed currencies.
Not app hosting or general trading, but more asset-backed currencies on the Holo model
start operating on Holochain and running app extensions on Holo to reach mainstream users.
Holo is widely used as a general purpose trading currency (akin to current Ethereum levels at
$300M/day). We will work with local authorities before extending the capability of Holo fuel,
and then our challenge will be what to do with too much transaction revenue, and how to
best invest it for the health of the ecosystem. We will certainly use crowd direction of funds
and may cap transaction fees.
We are Growing an Ecosystem
Within Holo we are creating shared incentives for efficiency instead of inefficiency. Holo fuel grows
in value the more efficient the network gets. We are developing Holochain, building Holo, building an
app development community and building a host network at the same time so we can build a
thriving ecosystem.
Why would application developers build and run on Holo? Because Holo offers:
●   RAD tools (Rapid Application Development) to get them started.
●   Use of familiar programing languages (like JavaScript) for their apps.
●   Their app leverages user assets, and they realize their users may still want to keep a copy
(like social media, Wikipedia, blogging platforms, etc.).
●   Interoperability with other crypto apps in the ecosystem.
●   Side channels and off-chain computing for Ethereum that is still decentralized.
●   Core modules and services they don’t have to rebuild (Distributed PKI, key revocation and
management, sovereign identity, indexing and search, content addressability, app store for
distributing your app, backups, file sharing, etc.).
●   Use of a hosting infrastructure which automatically scales as the user base grows, and where
a significant portion of your users may self-host.
By combining technical, currency, and dApp development into one ecosystem we are able to create
a business that:
●   Has a small central footprint (not many employees necessary) and lightweight infrastructure;
●   Creates value (reputation, money) for hosts, developers, and users rather than the network
owner;
●   Keeps hosting fees and transaction fees to a small portion of all Holo fuel transacted;
●   Allows for governance power to reside within the ecosystem, diminishing the need for out of
touch boards and management teams to exert central control;
●   Has agile boundaries between jobs for employees, contractors, and community;
●   Ensures that fees go into future features and infrastructure expansion rather than profit
taking.

Cloud Hosting Size and Growth
Holo brings sharing, through this innovative business model, to hosting. Initially, Holo is a hosting
business which can continue to grow its capacities with negligible capital investment (like Airbnb
became the biggest hotelier). We believe there is enormous opportunity within the cloud hosting
industry to benefit from predicted industry size and growth rates.

The cloud computing industry has one dominant player with a large number of smaller players. It is a
market where customers are looking for solutions outside those Amazon Web Services provide, so
there are opportunities to enter with a solution that meets currently unmet needs.
Amazon Web Services is growing revenue and profit quarter on quarter. We expect this to continue
for the next two years.

5. Funding Innovation: Bonding ICO with Crowdfunding
We are taking an innovative approach to funding Holo, running separate crowdfunding and ICO
campaigns.
Our ICO is a presale of hosting credits. The hosting will be provided by the boxes sold in our
crowdfunding campaign. We need the crowd as stakeholders in the whole project and its future.
People participating in the crowdfunding primarily as hosts and developers become stakeholders
along with pre-sale credit purchasers through the ICO. This is critical to creating a thriving ecosystem.
We intend to run a sale that is as inclusive as possible, meaning future Holo hosts and users will not
be pushed out by a few rich people buying all available credits within minutes. We also intend to act
responsibly by having a meaningful cap on the amount of credits we allow ourselves to sell, instead
of just raising as much as possible.
In December 2017 and January 2018, Holo will establish its infrastructure and services through a sale
of hardware hosting nodes, developer training, application development support, data hosting, and
data processing. This process will take place through a tripartite strategy aimed at reaching a broad
number of users and hosts, all the while ensuring access to the funds needed to deliver these
products.

Crowdfunding Campaign
Holo will offer training for building Holochain applications (through hackathons) and the necessary
hardware to run the Holochain protocol through a crowdsale on the IndieGoGo platform. The
crowdsale will fund the manufacture of hardware nodes required for hosting and processing data on
the Holo network by pre-selling these devices to future hosts. Purchasers of these nodes will be able
to earn Holo network credits for performing the service of hosting sharded data from distributed
apps once the network launches. In addition to hardware nodes, the crowdfund will offer in-person
training services for Holochain development, application design consultation, and tool kits for
jump-starting the app development process.
Private Sale
Hosting Credits Exclusive to Hosts and Developers — Not Transferable
Before Launch of Holo
Team members, friends, family, and Holo users who have already established themselves as
application developers or Holo hosts will have access to a limited pre-purchase of up to $1,000 per
person of hosting credits. They will receive a non-transferable digital receipt for their purchase, which
will be credited to their account when Holo launches in 2018. These sales are limited to $1M.
Qualified Investors
There will be an opportunity for qualified investors to have access to a limited pre-purchase of
hosting credits. They will receive a non-transferable digital receipt for their purchase, which will be
credited to their account when Holo launches in 2018.
ICO — Initial Community Offering
Transferable ERC20 Token Sale (Outside Restricted Countries)
Shortly after the launch of the Crowdfund. Holo will offer a pre-sale of its services in the form of
transferable ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum public blockchain. When the Holo network goes live,
these tokens can be exchanged for the corresponding credit balance on the Holo network and
destroyed upon exchange. The supply of tokens is set in relation to the demand proven by people’s
purchases from the crowdfund and of non-transferrable Holo fuel.
The initial token sale will open with a €2.5M supply that expands daily according to an equation that
translates the amount of demonstrated demand from the crowdfund and private sales into a
correspondingly increased ERC20 token supply. We only want to raise the capital needed to support
the expected demand — so this is our gauge to predict how many people will need tech support,
developer tools and trainings. This increased supply of new tokens will be released each day based
on the cumulative total of the crowdfund and private sale activity. Participants in the transferable
ERC20 token sale will pay in Ether and have access to their tokens within a week of the close of the
ICO, far in advance of the launch of Holo.

The design of this strategy is meant to establish a Holo user base through multiple avenues, bring in
the money needed to build and launch Holo, and raise only the resources necessary to support
expected demand.
Design of Solidity Smart Contracts
●   We take a strategy of splitting the contracts into small-as-possible logical units and leverage
code already written and tested by others.
●   Contract addresses are injected after creation so that if single contracts are updated, others
can be reconfigured to communicate to new contracts as needed.
●   All our contracts are based on the zeppelin-solidity library. Where modifications were
needed, we copy-pasted the zeppelin code and then made minor changes.
●   We use SafeMath for all mathematical functions.
●   All code is tested.
●   The contracts have roles that allow certain actions (i.e. updater, minter, owner) that are
usually updatable by the owner.
●   We attend closely to the gas usage of our code and optimize where possible.
Sale Mechanics
Sales from the crowdfunding serve as predictive indicators of the first year demand for participation
in Holo.
●   Each day’s sales of hosting boxes and developer events expand the supply of tokens
according to a fixed formula which means the token supply is not a predetermined number.
Once per day, the newly released amount of credits will be written to the blockchain
enabling further credit/token sales. If all tokens are sold out, nobody can buy tokens until the
next update releases more (which of course can be expanded by purchasing from the
crowdfunding campaign).
●   We don’t allow any single wallet to buy more than 10% of the credit supply of each day.
●   We log the amount of available credits and sold credits for each day of the sale period and
will make these statistics visible on our credit sale webpage.
●   After the sale period ends, we mint tokens for the team such that the team gets 25% of the
total number of tokens in existence. Thus, during the sale only 75% of credits, calculated
based on crowdfunding statistics, is made available for sale. The aim is to avoid artificially
increasing the supply with tokens minted for the team.
ERC20 Token Distribution
If we raise less than €1M we will return the ETH to all participants and will fulfill the project through
other funding strategies. Since 25% of the tokens are reserved for the organization, including
founders, team, and prior investors, we will mint €3.3M worth of tokens on day one, in order to make
€2.5M worth available for sale.
                                                                                                            Role   Allocation

Community                                                                                              75%
Daily Distribution
The fact that people will buy a token to speculate with does not mean there is a demand for the
product or service. We are leveraging our crowdfunding campaign as an indicator of demand for our
product and to gauge the size of our initial community of developers, hosts, and users. Based on the
sale of boxes and developer tools, new tokens are released by an algorithm connected to that
project demand.
We chose to start with €2.5M because we see that as the base cost to build the software and initial
infrastructure. However, the greater the demand, the more funds we will need to service that
demand and support the community. We are targeting our ICO raise to cover the needs of our first
year to support the community, the application developers, the end-user volume, the infrastructure,
and the liquidity reserves behind credits. The larger that demand, the more capital we need to
service it until transaction fees can cover operational costs.
The Future

Why Holo’s Strategy Will Work
Holo takes us beyond the limitations of blockchain
Holo fuel takes an agent-centric approach to cryptocurrency design rather than a data-centric
approach. In doing so, the Holo crypto-accounting system surpasses the efficiency limitations of
similar systems built using blockchain or other consensus-based distributed computing strategies. It
is a tokenless crypto-accounting engine. Eliminating tokens makes crypto-accounting substantially
28




more efficient. It frees massive amounts of computing power and network traffic from consensus and
synchronization of a global ledger of tokens.
We leverage principles from game theory and living systems feedback loops to establish an
equilibrium for the value stability of currency units being accounted for. This approach, using
Holochain, transforms the computational efficiency from blockchains O(n) to O(log n), and also
addresses common security issues for blockchain-based currencies.
Holo is a decentralised hosting ecosystem designed to work for you
Holo provides normal, everyday web users access to decentralized applications without needing to
install additional software. This new form of hosting blends small consumer grade devices with other
hosting assets to provide an efficient, dynamic, and inclusive hosting ecosystem.
Holo is an ecosystem designed by currency experts not token designers
The Holo team has vast experience over the last 15 years building alternative currencies. We have
designed monetary currencies, reputation currencies, and cryptocurrencies, and alternate value
flows to make communities work as intended. We are bringing this experience to build a Holo
currency that facilitates an active economy, and we think crypto-accounting is the way to do this
rather than crypto tokens.
Asset-Backed Crypto Economy
If Holo fuel starts getting used as a more general purpose currency, hosting will become a smaller
portion of the economy. This enables more asset-backed currencies for electricity, food,
transportation, lodging, and so on.
Holo is driven by a team determined to make decentralized,
community-powered applications work in many sectors
Holo has been developed by the team that is developing Holochain as part of its larger commitment
to realize, on a broad scale, the innovations of the Metacurrency project. The team views Holo as the
first of many projects that will combine the ground-breaking Holochain technology, pre-existing
physical infrastructure (in this case broadband internet), and transformative design principles for
currency, governance, and agent-centric marketplaces. Our team believes in the power of
large-scale, community-powered applications to change the world for the better, beginning with our
alternative to cloud computing — crowd computing. We are building both community and
technology. Our fundraising efforts along these lines aim to develop Holo, bootstrap the Holo
community, and enhance the functionality of Holochain.
Holo gives enormous upside for early adopters if we achieve our bold ambitions
The ERC20 token we are selling in the ICO is a credit for Holo. It will be convertible into Holo fuel at
launch.
Holo fuel is a currency for purchasing computing (processing, bandwidth, and storage), and thus can
be thought of as denominated in compute power.
To establish the initial pricing of that compute power, i.e. the amount of computing you will get for
one Holo, we begin by establishing a benchmark of a known system, Ethereum. We will use a suite of
real world compute tasks, both ones that others have run, and ones we run, on the Ethereum
29




blockchain, and use the observed cost in gas to denominate 1 compute unit. These tests will all be
visible on the Ethereum blockchain for public reference, and the code shared for anyone to run
themselves, if they wish.
The opening price of Holo when the network goes live, will be 1/10,000 that price because we know
that running similar computations on Holochain is at least that much more efficient, if not more so.
So if you send us 1 ETH, we will give the amount of credits that represents the efficiency multiple
between ETH and Holo credit established in our baseline tests. If our efficiency multiple when going
live is better than the baseline results, then the compute power you can buy with your Holo fuel will
be greater.
We currently project that the cost of computation will stabilize closer to 10 million times the
efficiency of Ethereum today.

Appendix: Criticisms and Objections
“You obviously don’t understand ‘Trustless’ currencies.”
Many in the crypto project space will probably perceive transaction fees being paid to an
Infrastructure-provider as centralizing too much authority in one entity. However, paying
maintenance fees to Holo, doesn’t give it a lot of extra power. It primarily enables responsible funding
so we don’t need to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to get off the ground. It also enables us to
create value stability by having an asset-backed currency.
The main power Holo has, in this context, is to update the software — the same centralized power
that exists in most crypto projects. When a small group of people can launch a hard fork of Ethereum
or Bitcoin, it is not really decentralized. 20We already have both pluggable governance for versioning
of applications and protocols, as well as individual autonomy to fork to versions of your own
choosing. Just because Holo launches an update, doesn’t mean you have to update, maybe you
want to convince some people to run Holo Classic!
In actuality, Holo is less centralized. For example, Holo doesn’t even hold a record of all transactions.
The transactions can all be found on nodes in the DHT, but they are sharded across many Hosts.
Hosts set their hosting prices, buyers and sellers on exchanges still set their prices, we have some
influence in setting prices for which Reserve Accounts sell hosting. But this is significantly less

influence than can be exerted by the 95% of Bitcoin mined by only a handful of pools, and 95% of
coins held by a handful of groups of accounts.
For the purists who are not satisfied by pluggable governance and a fully P2P underlying
architecture that is much less centralized than mining class nodes, we say: “Great! Use Holochain
without Holo. It is completely P2P with zero centralization and no currency needed.” Just don’t expect
it to provide DNS services to mainstream users to reach your applications.
“But you have to use consensus!”
What we must do is provide cryptographically-ensured data integrity on a distributed platform. For
that we must also operate with Byzantine Fault Tolerance, which we do. Holochain has means for
addressing corrupted communications, corrupted storage, masquerading, lost messages,
mis-ordered messages, corrupt nodes, malicious nodes, etc.
There is a kind of implicit consensus built into Holochain which is when an entry is “put” to the DHT
has saturated its destination neighborhood. If someone tries to put the same data to the DHT later,
there will be a collision. Collisions don’t have to be a problem, sometimes it means we’re just storing
copies of the same thing, so we can just attach an additional source with signatures to the entry.
However, in the small number of cases when it is rival data, like a username or a cryptocoin, then we
need to resolve the conflict. If the neighborhood is already saturated, that’s easy, first one wins, but
what happens when people try to “put” the same thing at almost the same time producing a collision
before either could saturate? Well, one could hard-code a system of analyzing gossip of peers to
determine an absolute timeline21, but because this is a space for generalized apps, we let the app
decide.
How about an auction to the highest bidder? Or the one with higher seniority? Or a better citizenship
rating? Or you have them work it out with each other? Or whatever other approach you want to use to
solve conflict in the context of the community using your application.
For the small percentage of times you are dealing with collisions of rival data, why would you want to
adopt the computational overhead of consensus. Well, the answer would be if you only run one very
simple app, and it is a data-centric view on tracking coins. Blockchain was designed for that one app.
Holochain is designed for all the others.
Appendix: More on Holochain
Holochain is an application development framework that provides cryptographically secured data
integrity for decentralised peer-to-peer applications without using consensus. We refer to a user of
a Holochain application as an agent.
Holochain ensures data integrity for distributed applications through establishing provenance of data
published from each agent’s local, immutable chain. Public entries are then shared to a content
21 http://www.swirlds.com/downloads/SWIRLDS-TR-2016-02.pdf
31




addressable distributed hash table (DHT), with cryptographic signatures, and enforcement of data
schemas, and application logic 22by randomly selected peers.
Therefore, Holochain establishes an agent-centric pattern for data production, sharing, and
23
management, rather than a data-centric absolutist frame                                                      (for which consensus is required). Once a
developer learns to do this kind of inversion in their thinking (from data-centric to agent-centric), then
building a distributed application on Holochain becomes much easier and many orders of magnitude
more computationally efficient than applications built for scale on blockchain.
Please consult the Holochain white paper 24for a more thorough understanding of its architecture. At
the time of publication, Holochain is already in Alpha release with a number of important early
applications (such as a distributed Twitter-clone, and distributed public key infrastructure), which
have been designed to demonstrate its scalability and usability. The delivery roadmap and upgrades
required to deliver Holo are shown below.

Appendix: Holochain Upgrades
Holochain currently provides most of the underlying componentry that we need for Holo, but there
are still some modifications and improvements needed in Holochain’s core code before Holo goes
live.
Source Chain Segmentation
Separating the ability to author and sign new source chain entries to a chain from the ability to
respond to other peers as a steward of someone’s source chain is critical. Hosts will never have
end-users’ private keys, so any changes will need to be signed by a user to create new entries on
their source chain. However, source chain headers and “public” entries will need to be stored with at
least some hosts in order to validate them when they are shared to the DHT.
Deeper Segmentation for Source Chain Privacy
22 Holochain White Paper or github repo
23 Brock, Arthur: The Two Main Fallacies of Distributed Computing and Blockchain
24 http://holochain.org/white-paper
32




Once private keys and source chain services are performing adequately we have outlined some
deeper layers for segmenting source chains. These involve breaking entries into parts, which no
single host holds, and are only reassembled en route to authorized requests.
Reputation Upgrades
Holochain already has basic infrastructure for nodes to reject data as fraudulent, and to report
fraudulent behavior to the neighboring peers of a bad actor. Evidence is provided in the form of a
“warrant” that includes the original fraudulent data signed by its author. The native immune system of
Holochain can use the accumulation of these warrants as the basis for blacklisting corrupted nodes.
Additional enhancements are planned for collecting better performance metrics of your
neighborhood peers, and enabling the possibility of defining node service classes.
Pluggable Governance
Pluggable Governance modules that enable applications to manage forking of their DNA are planned
for Holochain’s Alpha 1 release. This will be helpful for application providers when managing new
releases of their distributed software, enabling easy upgrades for their users. Within this governance
process, upgraded apps can write a closing entry onto a user’s old source chain that points to their
new source chain in the updated app. The new source chain in the updated app will also have
opening entries that point back to the old source chain. This provides continuity of function and
identity with clean versioning of code and protocols.
Scalability, Security, and Optimization
Holochain will undergo increasingly stringent scalability testing, security vetting, and performance
optimizations that will continue to mature the platform and ensure its reliability for mission critical
applications.

Holo is not natively optimized for anonymity. Continuity of accountability is included by design — not
a bug, but a feature. As such, the currency is not optimized for illegal, black market, or underground
activities. Holo fuel is optimized to build a consistently reliable, peered network of hosting providers.
Holochain enables continuity of identity across application contexts with its DPKI app, 25which can
interface with decentralized identity service providers of your choosing.
Hosts will be required to register if they want to redeem credits for outside currencies through
reserve accounts.
Consensus Attacks
25 See https://github.com/Holochain/dpki
33




Since Holo’s currency is not based on consensus as to what coins exist, but on individual
accountability for one’s transaction history, nobody ever needs to trust a consensus lottery. You can
always audit your counterpart’s chain to validate their state and know that they have the credits
they’re spending. You need trust nobody but yourself and your installation of the software. Therefore,
attacks on consensus are not vulnerabilities for Holo. This includes Majority (or 51%) Attacks, most
Sybil Attacks, Attacker with High Computing Power, High Energy Consumption (for Proof-of-Work),
Selective Dropping of Transactions, etc.
Attacks on Absolutism
Blockchain is a strategy for managing consensus on a single authoritative reality about data, and
manufacturing a single authoritative reality about time. 26On Holo there are no coins to double-spend,
and no absolute time-sequence to hack with clock drift, only the local sequence and immutable
history of each agent’s chain. Thus, Holo is not vulnerable to attacks on a single authoritative data set
nor attacks on a universal time sequence. This eliminates vulnerabilities to Double-Spend, Clock Drift,
and most Segmentation and Scalability attacks.
The Finney Attack
An attempt to execute a fraudulent high value transaction with low confirmation is a special
double-spending case called the Finney Attack. This attack merits more thorough coverage, because
there is a potential Holo variant, and we provide a detailed consideration in our white paper.
Malicious Nodes and Rival Code
If an agent hacks their code, anomalous outputs produced that fail to validate with random DHT
peers storing those outputs will be flagged as fraudulent and won’t propagate. Bad transactions can’t
spread and will result in a blacklisting of the committing agent by peers. This is similar to committing
bad blocks on a blockchain that won’t validate, except in Holochain a node only succeeds in forking
itself into their own reality where nobody else acknowledges the validity of their chain. Holo operates
in a strong Nash Equilibrium 27with all players incentivized to keep playing by the rules.
If you hack the code on your node, you could write invalid transactions to your local chain. But as
soon as that data tries to propagate to the DHT in the shared public space, then the DHT peers will
detect any invalid data that breaks the shared rules coded into the DNA.
If you could get some peers to collude with you and control your hash production to manage to have
data land with selected peers (already pretty difficult and likely detectable), then when you try to
transact with someone later who is not a corrupted node, they would still detect your corruption in
auditing your chain. There's no consensus needed because you can check for yourself.
Spamming Transactions
A node cannot generate transactions with itself, the parties in a transaction have to be distinct
identities. Two parties (or one person controlling two accounts) could rapidly transact back and forth,
while paying transaction fees on each transfer. This pattern of behavior would mostly just bog down
the two transacting nodes. Others would not be prevented from performing transactions, but this

would create a flurry of gossip traffic in the neighborhoods of those peers. This could result in
getting, at least, temporarily blacklisted if their peers detected the behavior as a Denial-of-Service
attack.
An example is a user trying to inflate their credit limit by making it look like they have a high trading
volume, but Holochain’s anti-gaming algorithms already detect this, so it won't work.
Illegal Content
Since Holo fuel is optimized for high volumes of micro-transactions, it does not carry much payload.
So content (that it is illegal to be in possession of) cannot be stuffed into a transaction that you would
be forced to hold. However, applications could certainly be built to hold such content, so hosts
should take care in the selection of applications they choose to run.
Some of the Same Issues as Blockchain
Holo has not introduced a new breakthrough in cryptography nor figured out how to prevent
network congestion and human errors, so we are still subject to some of the same basic
vulnerabilities as blockchain.
Breaking the Cryptography
SHA-256 does not seem to be in any imminent danger of being cracked28, but the crypto algorithms
are configurable and can be replaced with new ones in later versions. We have not focused on
Quantum-proof designs yet, and are happy to consider that for later releases as our community of
cryptographers and developers grows.
DDOS
Holochain has implemented some initial mechanisms to reduce gossip storms and to blacklist
Denial-of-Service attackers, but many of these optimizations will need to improve over time. A
Distributed Denial-of-Service attack is still a challenge to detect and block if there are enough
attackers. A DDOS attack would not likely bring down entire applications or the Holo network as a
whole, but if it targeted individual nodes on the network it could certainly disrupt their network
services at least temporarily.
Human Error
People will still lose their keys, use weak passwords, get computer viruses, and sometimes they will
abandon communities or even die, leaving inactive accounts behind. This is no different than things
that happen with existing cryptocurrencies. Holochain’s core DPKI app (Distributed Public Key
Infrastructure) can provide assistance in managing keys, managing revocation methods, and
reclaiming control of applications when keys or devices have become compromised.

Ceptr                                                                        Redesigning for social organisms.
Humanity is poised on the edge of a quantum leap in evolution, not at
the level of individuals, but at the level of our collective social
organisms like corporations, institutions and governments. In order to
make this leap, we need the same kind of architectures of
intelligence that make it possible for trillions of cells to work together
in an organism.
Large-scale collective intelligence requires communication to be
virtually instantaneous (electronic), peered, decentralized, semantic
and designed to evolve in response to rapidly changing needs.
Effective collaboration on such a scale would obviate most of the
power structures that underpin the social barriers to change and
could make formerly intractable problems (such as climate change,
species extinction, resource depletion, or poverty) quite readily
solvable.
Ceptr is designed to provide the building blocks of the kind of expressive
capacity which embodies nature’s architectures of intelligence and
enables an explosion of new patterns of collective intelligence on
every scale.

Computing units                                                              The measures of value for Holo fuel in terms of the hosting services they
provide: CPU clock cycles of processing, bandwidth of data transfer,
and megabyte months of storage.
Credit limits                                                                In a mutual credit currency, since the net supply is always zero, the
negative balances enabled by credit limits are what enables
accounts to have positive balances of credits. In Holo fuel there are
two main types of credit limits which are only available for providing
the asset-backing of the currency.
1.                                                                           Large: Reserve Accounts and Infrastructure Provider have special
algorithms for backing credits with outside currencies and
capitalizing the infrastructure maintenance and growth.
2.                                                                           Small: Hosting providers based on recent past months of hosting
earnings.
Crypto-accounting                                                            To secure transactions of digital assets through the keeping of financial
records.
Decentralized                                                                Decentralized computing is the allocation of resources, both hardware
computing                                                                    and software, to each individual space or office location. In contrast,
centralized computing exists when the majority of functions are
carried out, or obtained from a remote centralized location.

Ecosystem
Holochain                                                                          Provides the underlying cryptographic fabric with data sharing and validation
protocols that enable massive peer-to-peer applications. The agent-centric
approach to computation 29removes the need for consensus, eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks.
Rather than thinking of Holochain like blockchain, it may be better to think of
it like git repositories for each agent which can be published, shared,
synchronized or merged via a BitTorrent-like DHT (Distributed Hash Table).
The provenance of all shared data is strictly enforced and the structure,
content, and its compliance with shared application rules are validated by
30
randomized peers.
Holo fuel                                                                          The unit of account in Holo using value-stable double-entry accounting. The

Nodes                                                                              Common term for a peer or machine on a distributed system. Nodes
comprise the network, running the code, storing the data, and
communicating with each other.
If the network in question is a distributed system, the nodes are clients,
servers or peers. A peer may sometimes serve as client, sometimes server. In
a peer-to-peer or overlay network, nodes that actively route data for the
other networked devices as well as themselves are called supernodes.
RAD tools                                                                          RAD tools (Rapid Application Development)
Rapid Application                                                                  More than an SDK which gives devs access, it also includes quick scaffolding
Framework                                                                          tools that generate the framework for your application. There is some
validation and application logic you need to put in, but we build all the
directory structures and files for you. Most people don't know how to start
building a decentralised application, we give you the whole framework.
Reserve accounts                                                                   Reserve Accounts are bound to outside currencies (such as dollars, euro,

Bitcoin, or Ether) with corresponding credit limits in Holo for the deposits
held in reserve. These enable people to purchase hosting in Holo fuel and
enable hosts to redeem the credits they earn for providing that hosting for
the outside currencies.
Validation Process                                                             All data published to the shared space (DHT) is validated by checking it is
by Peers on DHT                                                                signed to the originating chain, and is produced according to the rules of the
application. The validating nodes are neutral parties, selected by the
randomization of the hashing process. This ensures all peers continue
playing by the shared rules encoded in the application and that the DHT
retains data integrity since only valid data can propagate.
