Challenges
Payment                                                                                                              Fraud
It is estimated that for every legitimate virtual purchase made, there are 7.5 virtual items lost
to fraud5,6 . Assets stored and managed online can be open to manipulation or chargebacks.
Merchants have to deal with extra burdens, and scammers damage the game's reputation.
High Fees and Slow Transactions
Game publishers and                                                                                                  communities rely on   third-party                                               platforms to process virtual goods
transactions. Gamers encounter                                                                                                             slowness, opaque fund flow, and high transaction fees7.
Lack of True Ownership                                                                                               & Rarity
Virtual items are, in-essence, licensed to the gamer and are often only available for use on
their proprietary platforms. At times they can be manipulated, lost, or taken back with little
recourse for the user. Genuine transparency is missing.
Locked in and                                                                                                        Centralized
Digital items and currencies are usually locked to a single game and not transferable.
Trading items outside of the game environment is cumbersome and difficult. If a player gets
banned, they can lose all of their items and currency.
No open standards
There are currently no widely-accepted standards for decentralized currencies and assets in
games. The user experience is often an afterthought, so users don't know what to expect.
Expensive & time-consuming
Developing a platform for managing virtual goods is
time-consuming and costly. The complexity of
managing a virtual economy on proprietary
infrastructure delays time to market. Security
concerns introduce a further set of difficulties.
Lack of value gamification
Value based gamification features are lacking in
content management systems and forum software.
Users do not get rewarded in real world value for
participation or contribution.

Initial Target Audience
Minecraft is one of the most popular video games in the world, with over 55 million monthly
10
players                                                                                                                  . Enjin is in a unique position because of our large existing Minecraft user-base.
The Unity game engine has a combined 770 million users across all games, and 34% of top

1000 free mobile games are made with Unity                                                                               . This along with Unity's strong presence in
Indie games is why Enjin Coin will be developing a Unity SDK early.

Technical Considerations
Today's gamers and website users demand
fast and snappy user interfaces.
The Ethereum network is currently limited in
throughput because it has an average block
time of 17 seconds (potentially up to 30
seconds). Future updates to Ethereum aim to
18
improve block times to 3 seconds                                                                           (Casper)
19
and allow transfers within milliseconds
(Raiden). Both of these updates are planned
for late 2017 to early 2018.
As the standard block times may impose some
delays, we will achieve a modern responsive
experience by using off-chain notifications.
Trusted Platforms will send an instant notification to the user's Smart Wallet for each
Transaction Request. When the transaction is accepted by the user and created on the
blockchain, the wallet will call the Trusted Platform API with the transaction to watch. The
game or website can then be updated immediately with a placeholder item or non-tradeable
version of the asset until enough confirmations are reached to allow full ownership of the
item. In the case of in-game currencies, the user's balance would immediately update in the
game but any unconfirmed portions would be locked from spending until the appropriate
number of confirmations are reached on the blockchain.
The Enjin Coin SDK will display confirmed and unconfirmed balances when listing ENJ and
custom assets, to make implementation easy and clear.
After Raiden and Casper updates are deployed on the Ethereum Network, these safeguard
measures will eventually become imperceptible.
Enjin will be testing the Raiden Network for lightning-fast asset confirmation speeds as
soon as the Developer and minimum viable product (MVP) releases are completed, later this
20
year

Tokens & Smart                                                                                 Contracts
We will deploy Enjin Coin and virtual assets as ERC20 tokens 21on the Ethereum network.
Ethereum is the most popular and widely supported smart contract blockchain, with a huge
development community and robust language support. We believe it has a strong future in
game development and in creating the new decentralized internet.
A collection of smart contracts will provide core functionality on the blockchain: the Mint,
Payment Gateway Contract, Smart Wallet Contract, Subscription Contract, Custom Coin
Registry, and TopList Contracts.
Public API
Enjin will host a public                                                                       Platform API using the JSON-RPC protocol with methods for
checking account balances and accessing each of the above smart contracts. This will allow
websites to display data to internet users without requiring a web3 wallet extension
installed in the web browser.
21 ERC Token standard #20 https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20

Create & Manage                                                                               Virtual   Goods
Games and communities can mint unique in-game items, currencies, and privilege tokens
using Enjin Coins as the parent currency. These assets can be converted back into Enjin
Coins by anyone holding them, at the original exchange rate which they were minted.
Minting Custom                                                                                Coins
Web, Mobile App and API-based user interfaces to the Mint smart contract will be
developed to make asset creation and management a simple process. The following
parameters define a new custom asset:
●   Name
●   Icon
●   Maximum Supply
●   Decimal Places
●   Exchange Rate
●   Access List
●   Data
Once created, a Mint smart contract will be cloned and registered in the singleton Registry
smart contract, which will allow custom assets to be recognized by all Smart Wallets.
The custom asset may now be minted by anyone in the Access List by sending Enjin Coins
to the new Mint smart contract. The Name, Icon and Access List properties may be updated
at any time by the Mint contract owner.
Whitepaper v1.10 https://enjincoin.io for latest version. ©2017, Enjin® PTE LTD




Exchanging Coins
The Mint contract stores all ENJ coins used to mint each unit of a Custom Coin.
Enjin wallets provide an interface to exchange Custom Coins back to Enjin Coins that are
contained in the Mint contract. This provides liquidity and the option of backing custom
assets with a known ENJ value.
Economically, any custom assets created with ENJ will decrease the number of ENJ in
circulation, preserving and increasing the value of the ENJ ecosystem over the long term.
Custom Coins that gain their own intrinsic value inside the gaming ecosystem will be held
and traded further by the community, while others could be traded back to regain their
original Enjin Coin value - giving all users easy liquidity.
Custom Coins as game items
The same mechanism for minting Custom Coins may be used to represent unique game
items. In this scenario, Enjin coins would be used to mint one or more Custom Coins
representing a game item that has value tied to it.
Whitepaper v1.10 https://enjincoin.io for latest version. ©2017, Enjin® PTE LTD




Unique Items
Non-fungible items may be issued at the time of minting by including unique data such as
the original player who owns the item, the date it was minted, the boss monster it was
looted from, or other irreproducible data infused into that specific unit.
Item Trading Economies
Using decentralized                                                                               assets allows gamers to trade with each other outside of the game
environment, and even trade and establish value across multiple different games. Custom
Coins will be compatible with any external exchange that supports Ethereum Tokens.
Additionally, Enjin will be developing a marketplace, wish-lists, and auction features,
directly inside of the Enjin social network and Activity Feed system to facilitate P2P trading.
The power of Custom Coins as privilege tokens
Custom Coins will be added to the existing access controls used across the Enjin CMS and
can be used as a powerful method of delegating power.
For example, a website owner may sell a limited number of "Ad" tokens that allow
uploading an ad to the news page or message board. In a game, a custom "Chest Key"
token could be required to open chests containing rare items.
Whitepaper v1.10 https://enjincoin.io for latest version. ©2017, Enjin® PTE LTD




Community Integration
Enjin Coin features will be integrated across the entire
Enjin CMS platform and natively supported by over
250,000 existing gaming websites.
Going past the Enjin CMS, Enjin will develop phpBB,
vBulletin, Xenforo and other forum and CMS
integrations as part of the open-source Platform API
that will allow even more internet communities to
easily adopt Enjin Coins into their websites and games.
Open-source PHP and NodeJS SDKs will give web
developers easy access to all Enjin Coin features and
functionality for custom website and API integrations.
Reward Automations
The existing automation system on the Enjin CMS Platform can reward coins to user
accounts based on powerful combinations of conditions and triggers. Various reward
system can be setup for user participation on the forum and other website activities.
Forum Boards
The Enjin CMS includes an incredibly feature-rich forum system, currently powering
everything from small teams to giant communities with over a million users participating on
their message boards. Forum votes and points will be extended with the ability to display
Custom Coins. Tipping will be added to the Forums so that coins can be tipped to users with
a few simple clicks (and this action would be displayed on the thread).
Donations & Group Pay
Many websites accept donations instead of using a store - especially
smaller eSports clans or guilds made up of friends. Enjin Coins will now
be a payment option in the Donation module and Stretch Goals.
Promotion & Advertising on the Enjin Platform
Enjin's extremely popular wall system will be upgraded with a Post
Promotion system which accepts Enjin Coins as the payment method.
Promoted Wall Posts can be targeted to specific games and interests within the audience of
18 million engaged gamers.

Decentralized                                                                                 Payment Gateway
The Platform SDK makes creating a complex
decentralized payment gateway a breeze. It is
designed to allow for unique new payment structures
which can reduce accounting work and increase trust
between merchants and customers.
Build your own                                                                                customized        Gateway
All backend functionality necessary to build a
PayPal-like gateway will be included in the Platform
SDK. As a provider, you can implement your own
desired features, such as carts, web invoices,
email/SMS notifications, refunds and more by building
on the open-source code and examples provided in the
SDK.
Payment Widget
Part of the JavaScript SDK release, the payment widget will allow websites to easily accept
payments in Enjin Coins and Custom Coins on any website. The widget may be connected
to any Payment Gateways built on the SDK.
Plugins will be available for major open-source and commercial carts such as Magento,
Drupal, Shopify, Volusion, Zen Cart and others.
Native Support for Custom Coins
The Gateway smart contract can be configured to accept all ENJ-based coins or a list of
specific token types. The JavaScript payment widget and shop plugins will identify and
display all supported custom coins, along with logos and associated metadata.
No Built-In Fees
Other than very small Ethereum transaction fees, complete payment gateways can be
created and no built-in fees or costs are imposed.
Multiple Payees
An exciting new feature of the payment gateway platform is multiple payees. Incoming
funds can be contractually divided up between more than one account. Payees may pull
their allocated funds from the Gateway smart contract. Consider these potential use cases:
Profit Sharing, provider Fees, charity or Prize fund.

Easy Automatic Payments
Using a novel Smart Wallet transaction mechanism, we can allow faster, easy to use
automatic payments on the Ethereum network, while maintaining the high level of security
that the blockchain allows.
The user will approve games and websites as being Trusted Platforms that can initiate a
transaction request. The user's wallet (mobile or PC) will prompt for confirmation whenever
a transfer of funds or a new subscription is requested.
In-game                                                                                       purchase scenario

The Enjin "Smart" Wallet
A key component in making everything easy
to use is the Enjin Wallet. Building on
existing light wallet design, the Enjin Wallet
streamlines the user experience further by
integrating with games and websites that
the user trusts. User accounts on each
trusted platform will be synced to the user's
Ethereum address.
We call this a "smart" wallet because of
multiple pieces of functionality that work
together to simplify the user experience:
●   The Platform API is used to correlate
verified gaming and website
accounts.
●   Transaction Requests are sent from
trusted platforms directly to the
wallet.
●   Subscriptions are confirmed and
managed by each local wallet.
●   Transaction limits and thresholds
enforced by the wallet's smart
contract.
●   Smart Contracts are used in the
background for data & displayed in a
clean UI.
●   Local rules can be set up for
accepting and automating
Transaction Requests.                                                                            UI Concept: User transaction
management
Trusted Platforms
The user can define a list of trusted APIs in the wallet settings, ranging from the Enjin API
itself, to trusted game publishers, to any third party running the Platform API. The wallet is
able to receive push notifications, receive transaction requests and sync user accounts from
each trusted platform.
A user can send ENJ coins to another user on a trusted platform by looking up their
username and the wallet will find matching contacts and their associated account address.

Transaction Requests
Instead of forcing users to copy and paste account addresses or receive risky web-injected
transaction commands, each trusted platform will send a Transaction Request to the wallet.
The user will be prompted with some useful information about the transaction and can
Accept or Deny it with a single click. This creates a clean and seamless user experience and
prevents the confusion and uncertainty typically associated with blockchain wallets.
Rules & Thresholds
Rules and thresholds can be defined to prevent undesired transactions. If a piece of game
logic creates transactions that exceed the thresholds, the wallet will display the pending
queue of transaction requests, and prompt the owner for confirmation. Rules can be defined
very narrowly, such as "Allow sending a single 20 Enjin Coin reward once daily."
Changing any of these settings will require a 24 hour safety delay and alert the user of a
pending setting update.
Mobile Wallet
The Enjin Wallet will also exist as a
Mobile (iOS/Android) application and
implement the same features
mentioned above. Many users will
prefer to accept transactions on their
phone while playing a game on their
PC. The mobile wallet can be set-up
quickly by scanning a QR code that
contains settings.
The mobile app will receive Push
notifications from Enjin and any
trusted platforms. If a transaction
request is pushed, the mobile wallet
will verify funds exist and ask the user
to Accept or Deny the coin transaction.
This will allow players in-game to
easily send coin transactions by using
their phone as the authentication
device.
UI Concept: Wallet with ENJ and custom
in-game items and currencies.

Virtual Goods Store
Create a Store in minutes
Game assets can be represented with Custom Coins, and the process of creating a shop for
in-game items or privileges is already straightforward with Enjin:
Websites hosted on Enjin Platform can associate a specific wallet containing ENJ and
Custom Coins to the website account. This would link any sellable assets to the Enjin Store
module admin panel and these could be listed for sale in-game and on the website priced in
Enjin Coins, Custom Coins, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum or Fiat currency.
DonationCraft
DonationCraft is a powerful shopping cart and ecommerce system used by tens of
thousands of Enjin communities daily and currently processing millions of dollars per
month in virtual item purchases and subscriptions. It supports a powerful API, in-game
purchases, validates game characters and allows for website automation using triggers and
purchase conditions.
Whitepaper v1.10 https://enjincoin.io for latest version. ©2017, Enjin® PTE LTD




Subscriptions
The Enjin Wallet opens up an exciting, unprecedented new feature for cryptocurrencies: the
ability to create real subscription services. Server owners and community owners will be
able to provide time-based services like power-ups, ranks, or unlock website content for
subscribed users.
Subscriptions involve 3 parties:
Merchant
An account with permissions to withdraw from the Subscription Smart Contract.
Subscriber
The customer with an Enjin Smart Wallet installed and a balance of Enjin Coins.
Trusted Platform
The API that creates subscription terms between the Merchant and Subscriber, and pushes
this as a Subscription Request to the Subscriber's wallet.
A Subscription Request containing metadata about the subscription is sent to the Smart
Wallet to be accepted. This will initiate a smart contract relationship between the Subscriber
and Merchant.
The Smart Wallet will automatically send funds to the smart contract at regular intervals,
and the Merchant will only be permitted to withdraw funds which have been accounted for,
based on elapsed time. The Subscriber may choose to cancel anytime to be refunded for the
remainder of the subscription interval.

Escrow for Virtual Items & Trading Platform
An escrow system using smart contracts allows multiple parties to trade any number of
game items and currencies safely.
Party A will initiate the contract:
●   Token(s) offered
●   One or more sets of token types accepted in trade
Party B can now check the contract and send any one of the accepted sets of tokens. The
first matching set of tokens will release the offered items to Party B.
This can be used for simple player-to-player trades, aided by the Smart Wallet in-game to
identify the correct item types and accept the trade with a tap or click.
It can also be used for an on-chain digital goods marketplace.
Party A may accept various types of tokens, for example:
●                                                                                             100 Enjin Coins
●   or.. 1 Sword
●   or.. 1 Helmet + 1 Breastplate + 2 Gloves + 2 Boots
The first buyer sending any of the accepted item sets will complete the escrow transaction.
Whitepaper v1.10 https://enjincoin.io for latest version. ©2017, Enjin® PTE LTD




Game Top Lists
TopLists allow people to rank games, servers, teams, or any other item. This is very
popular with game servers that solicit player votes or pay toplist websites to be ranked
higher.
The TopList format is being implemented as a decentralized smart contract with rules that
enable market bidding or democratic voting. The public nature of the blockchain can reduce
unfair corruption or manipulation of TopLists.
The creator of the list receives all coins spent to add items or vote. This incentivizes list
creators to promote and market their list to their audiences.
A list can be configured with a cost to add items and a cost per vote. These may be priced in
ENJ or a specific Custom Coin type.
The settings available to TopLists allow a range of ranking schemes, from simple
Democratic votes (one vote per identity), to Plutocratic votes (wealthiest voters ruling), to
somewhere in between. Democratic lists may be created using a limited set of custom coins
that are automatically sent to each long-term member of a community. This kind of
distribution is already possible using Automations in the Enjin CMS, as an example.

Game Integration & SDKs
Open-Source SDKs
●   Java
●   C#
●   C++
●   iOS Swift
●   Android C#
For the web, PHP and NodeJS SDKs will enable the creation of custom APIs and web
services used by games and websites.
Unity Plugin
Unity is a popular cross-platform game engine used by over a million developers. The Unity
C# SDK will allow creation of transaction requests, reading account balances, creation of
subscriptions, and querying toplists.
Minecraft Plugin
The Enjin Minecraft Plugin will include an Ethereum light client and communicate with the
Enjin API. New features will be added that allow servers to initiate transaction requests for
both the server and for players themselves. Spigot, Sponge, and Forge servers will be
supported since these are the most popular plugin platforms for Minecraft on the PC.
Unturned Plugin
We are developing a plugin to support Unturned, a popular multiplayer survival game with a
rich third-party plugin framework. Permissions and items will be linked to Enjin Coin assets,
and most features from the Enjin Minecraft Plugin will be ported for Unturned.
Unreal Development Kit 4
UDK4 is a powerful game engine used in many high-budget games as well as indie titles. A
C++ library will be developed with similar features to the Unity SDK above.
