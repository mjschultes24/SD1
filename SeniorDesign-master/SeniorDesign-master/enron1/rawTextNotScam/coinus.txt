1.1. Problems to Solve
01
Cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies are widely recognized as having the po-
Introduction
tential to create a new industry that would render the differences between traditional
industries meaningless in many parts of the world. Indeed, the ecosystem which takes
advantage of this potential is growing dramatically. However, there are some hurdles to
overcome if a myriad of decentralized applications based on these technologies is   to
enter the mass market. Some of these prerequisites include a technological scaling
solution that can handle a surge in transactions within a target deadline, the design of
a sophisticated economic mechanism that sustains and grows a decentralized system,
and a streamlined institutional framework that accommodates new industry innovations.
It is worth noting here that other equally important issues are not receiving due attention.
Convenience vs. Security
For the general population, a cryptocurrency wallet is the most accessible decentralized
application based on cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, and their conve-
nience and security are of the foremost importance. The problem is that the two require-
ments are often in conflict with each other. In many cases, hardware wallets like the
Ledger and the Trezor have some room for improvement in terms of user convenience
because they focus only on the safe storage of cryptocurrencies, and as a result, they
are simply used for long-term storage rather than in day-to-day life. By contrast, many
mobile wallets developed only through software-oriented solutions are bound to lag be-
hind their hardware-based counterparts in security as they focus on ease of use and
compatibility, which tends to limit their usage to low-value tokens.
We wanted to develop a solution that ensures maximum user convenience and provides
the same or higher levels of security compared to hardware wallets. The CoinUs Wallet
achieves these two goals by adopting a wallet interface that is optimized for mobile
and cryptocurrency technologies, and by adding the Keeper, a proprietary hardware
security device that offers the levels of security required by the financial industry. It also
provides significantly enhanced user convenience as it supports major currencies such
as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and EOS, ERC-20 tokens, and non-fungible tokens (NFT) like ERC-
721 through its single interface and security mechanism.
A Siloed Approach and Poor User Experience
Synergies between cryptocurrencies and the blockchain ecosystem require the paral-
lel growth of many different services. Currently, key services in the ecosystem include
centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, a host of decentralized applications,
cryptocurrency exchange/swap services, asset management, micropayments, decen-
tralized commerce, advertising, ICOs for funding projects, and airdrops for initial coin/
token distribution. As the ecosystem grows, a greater number of new services are ex-
pected to appear. The problem is that as such services enter the ecosystem in droves,
users find it very difficult to keep up with them because they have to spend a consider-
able amount of time on learning different types of interfaces and familiarizing themselves
with distinct sets of complicated processes in order to use these services efficiently. A
larger number of services means higher costs for building the user base, and the user
experience is more likely to deteriorate rather than improve. If cryptocurrencies and the
blockchain ecosystem are to grow hand in hand, an innovative improvement in user
experience is critical.

01
The CoinUs Wallet offers an integrated service environment dubbed the CoinVerse,
Introduction
which serves as a bridge that connects existing services in the ecosystem with new
ones that may appear going forward. The idea is to create an environment in which an
integrated interface allows individuals to use a single address or identity to access and
use a variety of services.
The Initial Critical Mass: A Challenge Facing Decentralized Services
Many decentralized services are built upon innovative ideas that are designed to deliver
social values such as fair distribution of wealth, but they lack adequate bootstrapping
strategies to build a minimum user base that allows them to survive and grow on their
own.
It varies from application to application, but building a minimum user base without exter-
nal input may prove to be unexpectedly costly, particularly when the market is already
dominated by existing centralized service providers. Even if decentralized eBay- or Am-
azon-type services promise greater benefits for seller and buyers, they cannot compete
without a sufficient number of sellers and buyers in the market. In addition, their econo-
mies of lesser-scale significantly limit their ability to offer competitive benefits.
The best way to address this issue of reaching the critical mass is to create a user pool
wherein a large group of services share their users as much as possible and provide
one another with incentives. The integrated service offered by the CoinVerse will play a
critical role in creating such a user-sharing environment. With its effective and sophis-
ticated incentive system to reward players who contribute to the growth of the network,
the CoinVerse will help establish a solid foundation for building a user-sharing scheme.
Selling the Keeper, a hardware security device, through the CoinVerse’s community
commerce would serve as a good example of such network growth strategies.
The                                                                                            CoinUs project began as a human-centered initiative which goes beyond technolo-
gy to prioritize usability and the characteristics of individual users, and we will leverage
the CoinVerse project, which embodies our philosophy and extended vision, to create a
blockchain ecosystem with a self-sustaining virtuous cycle.

1.2. Solutions Overview
01
The starting point of our solution is the combination of the CoinUs Wallet and the
Introduction
CoinUs Keeper, and it is the CoinVerse which completes the integrated ecosystem.
CoinUs Wallet
The key element in realizing the objective of the CoinUs project is the cryptocurrency
wallet. The CoinUs Wallet is a light client that is optimized for mobile environments and
has been designed to enable the intuitive management of various cryptocurrencies and
tokens.
It does not require complex configuration, and it uses best technological practices and
optimum security standards to offer the perfect experience, allowing users to manage
their digital assets with ease and convenience.
While providing the main benefits of blockchain-based technologies, the CoinUs Wallet
offers standards for storing, buying, selling, transferring, and exchanging digital assets
by simplifying the interaction between blockchain assets and adopting reliable method-
ologies.
Its design ensures versatility, usability, and security, and it uses best practices available
in the current blockchain ecosystem to provide interoperability and compatibility with
existing solutions and services.
CoinUs Keeper
We have adopted a technology called a transaction-signing one-time password (OTP),
which is widely used in the financial industry to offer a new and robust security solution
for cryptocurrency wallets.
For users, the solution is provided in the form of a dedicated device for the CoinUs Wal-
let. We have named this device the Keeper.
It provides the CoinUs Wallet, a type of light wallet, with robust security, which              is the
biggest strength of hardware wallets. This allows the service to remain light and maintain
its user convenience while reinforcing security at the same time. In this way, the CoinUs
Wallet works as a “hybrid wallet,” a novel concept in the crypto world.
To the Keeper, we have applied an information dispersal algorithm, an innovative meth-
odology that offers a safe way to store the wallet’s private keys, to ensure a more robust
level of security. The simple combination of the Keeper and CoinUs Wallet provides
portability, convenience, and stronger security, which will enable the service to be the
best asset management solution for users.

CoinVerse
Overview
[Picture 1] The CoinVerse Ecosystem
The CoinVerse is a comprehensive package based on a human-to-blockchain interface designed to build an inte-
grated cryptocurrency ecosystem. It represents our human-focused approach that places greater importance on
user values and experiences than on technology. It also embodies our vision to create a “human-blockchain-uni-
verse interface” And, ultimately, create a global blockchain community. We will build a scalable environment in stag-
es, wherein the CoinVerse middleware is leveraged to offer a host of services ranging from individual authentication
and DEX to asset management, cryptocurrency swaps, and community commerce.
Initial services will include ICO listing, airdrops, KYC, and preliminary community commerce using the Keeper, and
a variety of key services will be integrated into the portfolio In multiple phases according to our roadmap.
8




02
CoinUs Wallet   The CoinUs wallet focuses on creating a seamless user experience for interacting with
a blockchain.
Its light client architecture eliminates the need for the entire nodes to ensure an excellent
mobile experience, and the Keeper allows CoinUs Wallet to maintain its usability and
portability while offering more robust security.
In addition, its hierarchical deterministic wallet structure enables CoinUs Wallet to re-
main versatile without being dependent on a specific blockchain network protocol. The
Wallet will also support multiple languages, starting with Korean and English, to facilitate
consistent user experience across the globe.
The CoinUs Wallet will be launched on mobile devices first, and we plan to release a PC
version that accommodates Chrome extensions.
2.1. Versatility
A multitude of blockchain protocols may exist until the protocol competition between
public blockchains comes to an end, and a small number of protocols with clear benefits
survive in the ecosystem.
Given these circumstances, most users today invest in multiple cryptocurrencies, and
they need a versatile, protocol-agnostic cryptocurrency wallet.
Most wallets in the market leave much to be desired in meeting these needs. Creating
and managing multiple wallets to invest in different kinds of cryptocurrency is cumber-
some and poses many potential security risks.
Multi-Cryptocurrency Wallet
We offer a solution that allows users to store multiple cryptocurrencies and tokens in a
single wallet.
In the initial phases, we will support i) Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, ii) Bitcoin, iii) EOS
and EOS tokens, iv) Litecoin, v) Bitcoin cash, and vi) Stellar and NEM.
(The priority of cryptocurrencies may change depending on advances in blockchain
technology, market trends, and strategic priorities.)
9




02
In addition to these initial cryptocurrencies, we will also support many others in stages
CoinUs Wallet
in accordance with our strategic priorities. This enables users to store and manage their
multiple cryptocurrency assets in the CoinUs Wallet. The technology and experience
built through the support of different cryptocurrencies will shorten the time required to
accommodate the next cryptocurrencies and serve as the foundation for supporting
more than 20 cryptocurrencies and hundreds of ERC-20 tokens.
When the CoinVerse Ecosystem is in place, we plan to logically integrate the crypto-
currencies supported by the CoinUs Wallet so that users can treat them as a single fiat
currency.
In addition to supporting multiple cryptocurrencies, the multi-wallet feature offers en-
hanced convenience by allowing users to make portfolio investments from a single ac-
count for smart asset management.
This is made possible by our HD wallet structure, which uses a hierarchical concept
wherein relevant keys are generated from a single starting point called the seed. After
creating a wallet once, users can manage a host of additional cryptocurrencies simply
by adding them to the wallet with a single click.
Multi-Language Support
Another feature that enhances the versatility of the CoinUs Wallet is multi-language sup-
port. It is a prerequisite to a consistent user experience across the globe. Starting with
Korean and English, we will offer support in Japanese and Chinese as well.
Multi-Exchange Rate Managing
The                                                                                          CoinUs Wallet offers price information on exchanges around the world.
A simple change in configuration allows users to view the prices on multiple exchanges
and modify the exchange list at any time. Exchanges available in this feature will be ex-
panded in multiple stages according to our cryptocurrency support roadmap.
Through this feature, users have easy access to prices, transaction volumes, and price
gaps of cryptocurrencies on different exchanges. We will also add an alert feature that
pushes any change in total asset value in real time.
10




02
CoinUs Wallet   Dapp Browser
Direct access from a wallet to decentralized applications (dApps) requires a dApp brows-
er. We will make it possible to access dApps without having to install a separate module.
A limited number of applications with high commercial viability will be supported initially,
followed by an additional listing and an SDK module that will enable developers to support
applications themselves.
Blockchain Explorer
The CoinUs Wallet will be equipped with an explorer that enables direct access to re-
al-time transaction data on key blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This access
allows users to identify lags in transaction times caused by issues like a delay in block
creation and to respond effectively to such network disruptions.
Asset Portfolio Management
The CoinUs Wallet provides a single, comprehensive view of all coins and tokens and
offers their valuations expressed in fiat currency or cryptocurrency. In addition, users
can easily check the return on investment (ROI) of either a single cryptocurrency or all
of their cryptocurrencies for a certain period. We also plan to add alert features to imple-
ment our rebalancing strategies.
2.2. Usability
We leverage applications that individual users access every day to enable the broad
adoption of the blockchain ecosystem. This objective necessitates continued improve-
ments in the CoinUs Wallet’s usability, and thus we will focus our efforts on enhancing
the user experience.
Only One-Time Backup
Today, most wallets in service which store multiple cryptocurrencies require users to
perform backups individually for each cryptocurrency. This is cumbersome and is likely
to increase the number of security risks arising from user mistakes.
We address this issue by adopting Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP)—specifically,
BIP32, BIP39, and BIP44. Instead of periodically backing up each sub-wallet for differ-
ent cryptocurrencies, users can simply write down on a piece of paper the mnemonic
that is provided at the time of creating a CoinUs Wallet account and keep the paper in
a safe location.
11




02
This arrangement removes the need to create separate wallets for cryptocurrencies to
CoinUs Wallet
be added in stages and allows users to manage multiple cryptocurrencies by adding
them with a single click.
In addition to such mnemonics, users can back up their wallets with a QR code. Since
a user-defined password is required when creating such QR codes for additional en-
cryption, it is impossible to steal cryptocurrencies stored in these wallets with just the QR
code, even if it is leaked to an outside entity.
Tokens Auto Discovery
The CoinUs Wallet offers the automatic detection of ERC-20 tokens. The balances of to-
kens correlated with the wallet address automatically appear on the asset lists of users,
which allows for smarter asset management.
Since ERC-20 token transactions are stored not in the normal address but in the contract
address, the only practical way for users to check their balance is to log on to the service
in question and enter the contract address.
As the retrieval of ERC-20 token transactions require a special mechanism, most wallet
services don’t offer this feature. We have an index server in place which catalogues all
transactions related to a specific address, including the transfer of tokens, and our wallet
client queries the smart contract to give the balance, including that of tokens.
Explore Transaction History
The Ethereum blockchain stores the state of each account, so users don’t need the
transaction details concerned to know the assets of a specific address. For this reason,
most light client-based wallet services don’t provide a transaction history.
From the perspective of users, the data on token transfers is also an asset, and thus
a key piece of information. Our index server automatically detects and identifies all
transactions relevant to the address of the user to generate a transaction history on the
CoinUs Wallet.
In accordance with our strategies to support different cryptocurrencies in stages, we
provide an integrated user interface through which users can view the transaction histo-
ry of Ethereum and the cryptocurrencies supported by the CoinUs Wallet.

Security is the most important issue and is one of the foremost mandates for cryptocur-
rency wallets, as they must manage the precious assets of users safely.
In addition to the security offered by the HD wallet structure, which was adopted during
the design phase, we have two additional layers of security in place for the CoinUs Wal-
let to store our users’ cryptocurrency assets in a safe manner.
2-Factor Authentication
Two-factor authentication means the process of authenticating the user with two or more
factors. It is also referred to as multi-factor authentication.
The more factors that are involved in user authentication, the lower the risk of false au-
thentication becomes. Not everything can be used as an authentication factor, however.
There are some standardized authentication factors.
Knowledge Factors: things that the user knows
Possession Factors: things that the user owns
Inherence Factors: things that are unique to the user
Knowledge factors include passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), and pat-
terns.
Possession factors can be likened to the act of using your key to open the door to your
home, and such examples are tokens, smart cards, and credit cards. In the case of OTP
authentication, which is widely used for mobile transactions, your mobile phone is             a type
of possession factor.
Inherence factors refer to qualities that one is born with, such as fingerprints and irises.
The CoinUs Wallet offers two-factor authentication during the process of wallet creation
by requiring users to present a password or PIN along with their fingerprint. The account
password is also used in creating a backup QR code.
In addition, the Keeper terminal also serves as a possession factor.
13




02
Off-Line Signing and Trust Zone
CoinUs Wallet
With all software programs including the CoinUs Wallet, computing requires data in
memory or storage. Such data is a key piece of security information. If it falls into the
hands of a malicious attacker, important security information could be Compromised.
The CoinUs Wallet has multiple layers of security in place to make sure that the process
of handling security information remains intact. One such security arrangement is to cut
the mobile device off from outside and make it offline while important security information
is being processed, which prevents this information from being leaked online. After the
processing is over, the memory is cleared to stave off any leakage.
In addition, we will leverage the trust zone (secure world) supported by the OS kernel to
strongly protect the computing process, which could be vulnerable to security threats
because it usually takes place in the user mode (normal world).
The offline signing scheme will be applied to Android first, and then followed by iOS.
Since the trust zone requires both the hardware (CPU) and the OS (Android, iOS), we
plan to implement the scheme first in environments that meet these requirements.

2.4. Technical Approach
02
CoinUs Wallet   The CoinUs Wallet has adopted the highest technology standards, which are derived
from the best practices in the blockchain ecosystem. This is intended to ensure higher
levels of security and support the interoperability and compatibility with current block-
chain protocols, solutions, or services.
Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallet
The CoinUs Wallet is designed with the HD wallet structure, a type of hierarchical deter-
ministic wallet, to:
Support a variety of cryptocurrencies and tokens with a single account
Support multiple wallets with a single account
Make data restoration easy through a single backup
Offer a newer, stronger security solution.
[Picture 2] HD Wallet Structure
In accordance with the BIP39 standard, 12 or 24 mnemonics (a kind of hint word) called
seeds are created. It is from these seeds that wallets are derived. Wallets are originated
from such seeds by going through multiple phases in a deterministic and hierarchical
process. Instead of being created randomly from seeds, wallet addresses are comput-
ed through a pre-defined logic the moment such seeds are determined.
The CoinUs Wallet has adopted the BIP32, BIP39, and BIP44 standards to provide mul-
tiple wallets which are derived from a single set of seeds. This allows users to restore
and backup their wallets easily without having to present other information. In addition,
the HD wallet structure is compatible with the blockchain network and other services as
it is supported by a large number of blockchain protocols.

The blockchain inherently offers near-perfect security, but it could be vulnerable to hack-
ing if the user’s personal or asset information is stored on a separate physical server. A
classic example of this is a series of exchange hacking incidents that have occurred in
recent years.
To ward off these risks, user information is stored only in the CoinUs Wallet, which is a
light client, so users have full control over their information, and this prevents any chanc-
es of data leakage.
There are only two usages for our servers: We use them when we provide general infor-
mation such as app distribution, notifications, prices, and ICOs without using personal
and asset information, and we also have an indexing server in place to enable informa-
tion exchange with the CoinUs Wallet in order to provide information on ERC-20 and
EOS tokens.
The restricted data availability is strategically chosen tradeoff that enhances the wallets
usability without introducing vulnerability that can compromise the assets stored in the
wallet. The indexing server allows the CoinUs Wallet to discover tokens automatically
and explore users’ transaction histories.
To be more specific, the server i) conducts high-level analyses of all transactions on the
blockchain, ii) indexes movements to public addresses, iii) catches events concerning
token transfers, and iv) indexes token transfers.
These functions are computationally too expensive to perform directly on mobile devic-
es.
Another Approach
Today it is very hard to find a mobile light wallet that supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and
EOS all at the same time. Even if there were any such wallets, it is very unlikely that they
would offer a single seed or backup feature. Our development team is leading the indus-
try in this regard and we plan to begin supporting coins including Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin,
Stellar, and NEM in the fourth quarter of 2018.

CoinUs Keeper   We leverage the transaction-signing OTP technology employed by the financial industry
to provide a novel, robust security solution for cryptocurrency wallets. Our new security
solution, dubbed the CoinUs Keeper, is a dedicated terminal for the CoinUs Wallet.
[Picture 3] How the CoinUs Keeper works
The Keeper stores important information managed by cryptocurrency wallets in its se-
cure element to protect the cryptocurrency assets of users when they lose possession
of their wallets through loss of their phones and so on.
The Keeper is initially configured by coupling its unique device ID (UDID) and the Wal-
let’s universal unique ID (UUID), which allows communication with the coupled wallets
only. We will allow up to two CoinUs Wallet apps on smartphones to be connected to
the Keeper.

03
Protocol                                                                                         CoinUs Keeper
The Keeper device runs on batteries and does not respond to the physical push of a
button until it receives a successful transaction request. Upon receiving such a request,
the device sends just one transaction response within the first minute.
We also use the concept of a session. If there is no communication within the first five
minutes of an initial coupling or verification being completed, the session in question
will expire and a new verification process is required. All forms of communication have
a valid two-byte session ID, which is managed by the device, and a new verification is
needed when this ID is deemed invalid.
[Picture 4] The process of sending commands
A simple docking method with the CoinUs Wallet allows the Keeper to provide porta-
bility, convenience,                                                                             and more robust security, and turns the Wallet into a hybrid wallet
which offers strong security and a variety of features.
In mobile environments, the Wallet can be used to view cryptocurrency assets, transac-
tion histories, and price information only, while the device is kept in a safe location like a
cold wallet. If the user needs to make a transaction afterward, a simple connection with
the Keeper allows them to manage their assets and transfer their cryptocurrencies.
Hardware wallets carry a significant tradeoff between security and convenience, and
using a laptop as a cold wallet also has its limitations. The Keeper is an innovative alter-
native to these arrangements.

4.1. CoinVerse Overview
04
The CoinVerse is based on a human-to-blockchain interface which is designed to build
CoinVerse
an integrated cryptocurrency ecosystem which benefits all stakeholders. It represents
our human-focused approach, which places greater importance on user values and
experiences than on technology. It also embodies our vision to create a “human-block-
chain-universe interface” Which brings together individuals across the globe into a glob-
al community.
[Picture 5] CoinVerse Ecosystem Logical Model
The key components of the CoinVerse are the cross-world bridge network (CBN) and
the CoinVerse middleware, which connect Wallet users to the ecosystem. The middle-
ware will contain protocols, APIs, and SDK modules that enable connections with a vari-
ety of services. We are exploring the best technological solutions for the CBN, including
Ethereum’s Plasma chain.
It will take a significant amount of time until a complete form of the CoinVerse is created,
but we will start with services that are implementable in the currently developed Wallet,
and then expand the infrastructure in stages in accordance with our roadmap to add
more services going forward.
During this integration process, new services That are not featured on the roadmap may
be rolled out first, and the priority on the originally planned ones could be changed as
well, depending on the market situation.
19




4.2. Identity Management, KYC
04
In most cases, KYC authentication is required to participate in ICOs or increase with-
CoinVerse
drawal limits after signing up for an overseas exchange. But this is inconvenient, and it
is a hassle to upload an ID or passport photo for KYC authentication every single time.
It is for this reason that individual users find the process very difficult or cumbersome.
Based on the information given upon initial registration, we enable users to go through a
simplified KYC authentication for ICOs that require the same information. This is part of
Token Launcher, one of the CoinUs Wallet’s key services.
We will expand the existing module for the KYC authentication process into a block-
chain-based authentication service. It will then be further upgraded to offer services for
decentralized applications that require authentication and serve as an integrated iden-
tity management module for a host of additional CoinVerse services to be integrated.
4.3. Community Commerce
Many cryptocurrencies can already be used as payment on e-commerce sites, but no
project that uses a unique incentive scheme of the crypto economy has yet been suc-
cessful.
We plan to offer a community commerce service with a strong incentive structure to
encourage many communities and users to adopt the CoinUs Wallet and tokens for
e-commerce transactions so that they can contribute to the growth of the entire network.
To begin, we will sell the Keeper, our hardware security device, directly through com-
munity commerce to demonstrate the potential of this new model. We will then evaluate
and analyze the outcome of this pilot sale to create a comprehensive system so that in-
dependent sellers can offer their products and services through the CoinVerse network.
4.4. Integration with DEX
A decentralized exchange (DEX) is the most optimum form of exchange for users who
have direct control over their cryptocurrencies through a safe wallet and want to engage
in inter-cryptocurrency trading, as they can perform transactions directly through their
wallets without entrusting their cryptocurrency assets to an exchange.
We will first push for the integration of the CoinUs Wallet with Ethereum DEXs and then
explore the viability                                                                        of the connection with DEXs and Kyber networks that support 0x
protocols. The connection with EOS-based DEXs will also be pursued in stages.
The next target will be a connection with DEXs that allow transactions between different
types of cryptocurrencies through an inter-chain solution such as Cosmos and Polkadot.
20




4.5. Instant Coin Swap
04
Users may have cryptocurrencies which are not registered with a DEX, or may need
CoinVerse
to quickly exchange a small amount of registered cryptocurrencies into another type
of cryptocurrency. This is where Instant Coin Swap comes in. A desirable use case for
such transactions would be to allow users to exchange some of their assets for utility or
game tokens which are needed to access a certain application.
Services like Shapeshift already offer similar services by using APIs of centralized ex-
changes. The CoinUs Wallet will provide this instant cryptocurrency swap service by
connecting APIs to key centralized exchanges in Korea and the rest of the world. With
a new feature to be added, users don’t have to make a cryptocurrency swap request
manually when they want to exchange their assets for some other cryptocurrencies.
They can simply send their cryptocurrencies to the address of the target cryptocurren-
cies they have chosen and the system takes care of the rest. Their cryptocurrencies are
swapped automatically with the target cryptocurrencies, which are then sent back to
them.
4.6. ICO Token Launcher
The CoinUs Token Launcher simplifies and streamlines procedures involved between
users and machines (devices or servers) to ward off any potential human errors that
may take place during the course of an ICO. This paves the way for startups to grow into
innovative companies in the blockchain ecosystem and will provide wallet users with an
opportunity to make prudent investments in a safe environment. A base module for this
feature has already been integrated into the Wallet.
Through this arrangement, companies that conduct an ICO can:
Announce and promote their planned ICO immediately
Obtain KYC information verified through the CoinUs Wallet
Receive funding which is safe from hacking attacks by having an auto-generat-
ed ICO address free from forgery and fraud
CoinUs Wallet users can:
Obtain expert-verified ICO information and participate in ICOs easily and quickly
Use the one-pass KYC procedure for simpler ICO investments and more robust
protection of their personal information
Make direct investments through the CoinUs Token Launcher
21




4.7. Airdrop Management
04
Not only ICO projects but also a multitude of listed cryptocurrencies conduct different
CoinVerse
types of airdrops for marketing and promotional purposes. In conducting an airdrop,
most companies open a Telegram channel to promote their airdrops and recruit partici-
pants. They want participants to receive marketing information through this channel on a
continuing basis. With most airdrop events, however, it is impossible to know if potential
participants remain in the channel, and some even try to gain benefits by creating false
Telegram IDs or randomly creating multiple addresses, making it difficult for ICOs to
achieve the desired results.
We have turned some innovative ideas into a system which reduces these abuses sub-
stantially, and we conducted four airdrop events with our partners through our CoinUs
Airdrop System. Project A, which targeted a global audience, saw the abuse detection
rate for its airdrops increase to 82.7%, and those of other projects were able to identify
at least 30% of their participants as abusive.
[Picture 6] Abuse detection rates for airdrops by partner
CoinUs Airdrop addresses these issues by:
Screening out                                                                                                       of malicious participants
Checking in real time if participants are in the Telegram channel
Monitoring cross-border or cross-regional participants
This helps reduce marketing costs by up to 40-66% and provides a new opportunity to target real participants
in marketing activities.
This also allows ICO performers to reduce costs for planning, operations, and control, and to promote their
projects to potential customers more easily to maximize the impact of their marketing activities. We will further
upgrade our Airdrop System so that users have convenient access to airdrop events through their wallets.
22




4.8. AI based Digital Asset Management
04
In connection with an AI-based platform, we provide membership users with a global
CoinVerse
asset management service which guarantees low-risks and medium returns. This ser-
vice consists of personalized products that fit the investment preferences and asset
composition of membership users. Product portfolios may be composed of overseas
stocks, cryptocurrencies, or both.
We will include this service in our CoinUs membership package and leverage our
CoinUs Analytics to index the block information of cryptocurrency platforms other than
Ethereum. We will also analyze big data for hidden information in order to provide mem-
bership users with exclusive information that is of premium value. For this service, we
may partner with outside entities such as TrustVerse.
4.9. Micropayment & Payment Gateway
The broad use of cryptocurrencies for online payments, which includes micropayments,
requires a system which offers low fees and fast transaction speed. Most main net cryp-
tocurrencies do not meet these two requirements.
We will build a separate transaction network to process micropayments in a fast, cost-ef-
ficient manner. We consider Plasma Cash or Debit to be among the most promising
candidate solutions for this network. Tokens that remain on this payment network can
easily be transferred back to main nets.
We also plan to integrate decentralized stable coins (e.g., Dai), which are pegged to the
US dollar or the Korean won, into this payment network. This will allow us to provide a
host of e-commerce sites with gateway services by using a stable coin-based payment
system. In other words, buyers can make payments with the cryptocurrency of their
choice and sellers can get paid with fiat currency-connected tokens or other tokens that
they choose.
23




5.1. Design Rationale
05
The survival and growth of the CoinUs Wallet and the CoinVerse depends on their un-
Token Economy
derlying token economy. From our perspective, the critical issues involving its design
are as follows.
Critical Mass for a Minimum Sustainable Economy (MSE)
The operators of centralized applications take most of the value created from their net-
works, and decentralized applications have emerged in protest against this situation by
offering promises of greater benefits to network participants. However, few have been
successful because they lack effective strategies to secure a critical mass in the initial
phases. The first issue that our token economy should address is how the network’s
internal mechanism can sustain itself to create a minimum sustainable economy (MSE).
For an MSE to be created, the CoinVerse, our integrated ecosystem, should redirect ser-
vice fees and other revenues to the reward pool to compensate those who contribute to
network growth in order to maintain and grow the network without external help. Meeting
this requirement necessitates that the number of users exceeds the critical mass and
that the value gained by users from transactions in the services provided by the network
be sufficient to promote its growth on a continual basis.
Resources for Bootstrapping Reward
An MSE requires a significant number of users and a substantial reward system. As
this reward scheme should be very aggressive in the initial stages, the CoinUs token
economy needs to be able to secure sufficient resources. It is for this reason that we
have designed BNUS tokens, which are used for reward purposes in the CoinVerse
ecosystem, along with CNUS tokens that are used for service fees and payments. The
value of BNUS tokens should be high enough to motivate participants to contribute to
the growth of the network in the initial stages but should not cause the dilution of CNUS
tokens’ value. The Bancor protocol may serve as a very efficient tool in striking this bal-
ance. The terms BNUS and CNUS will refer to both singular and plural forms of each
token depending on context.
The Stability of Utility Tokens
An adequate supply of CNUS, the utility tokens for the entire CoinVerse, will greatly
help the ecosystem to run smoothly and defend their market value. If this supply in the
market is out of sync with the network’s growth and gets too large or small, not only does
the CNUS’s price volatility become excessive, but also the stability of the ecosystem,
in general, could also be undermined. A systematic approach such as supply control
is needed in order to respond to dramatic changes that have a considerable negative
impact on the ecosystem.
24




A Virtuous Circle for Continued Growth
05                                                                                             Even after a minimum critical mass for the successful operation of the CoinVerse eco-
system is reached, network participants should be properly rewarded for their contri-
Token Economy
butions so that the process of creating and redistributing value continues to spur the
growth of the network.
Preventing the Concentration of Tokens and Their Value
Long-term token holders get rewarded through the rise in prices as the network grows.
This helps to stabilize and boost token prices, which in turn contributes to network
growth. However, if this passive long-term ownership is overly rewarded, it may discour-
age participants who want to make an active contribution to the growth of the network.
A mechanism is needed to prevent the excessive concentration of token ownership and
the reward for active contributions should be increasingly larger than that of passive
ownership.
The above considerations form the basis of the CoinUs token economy, as explained
below.
5.2. Issuance and Characteristics of CNUS & BNUS
CNUS  is  a  cryptocurrency  which  serves  as  a  tool  of  economic  activity,  which  in-
cludes payments made in the CoinUs Wallet and the CoinVerse. A total of two billion
(2,000,000,000) CNUS, or 100% of the planned issuance, have already been issued. As
described in Chapter 7 of this document, they have either already been distributed or
will be distributed. The price of CNUS is determined by the demand from buyers and the
supply from sellers on exchanges.
On the other hand, BNUS are designed as a reward for contributions to the growth and
stability of the network. They are issued along with CNUS                                      as a reserve in accordance
with the Bankor protocol. More specifically, BNUS are issued by sending CNUS to a
smart contract, and the number and price of BNUS is automatically set by the contract.
One billion (1,000,000,000) CNUS out the two billion (2,000,000,000) issued have been
assigned for network rewards and marketing purposes. They will be used as a reserve
in stages, which serves as the first mechanism for BNUS issuance. In addition, all CNUS
gathered as fees in the CoinUs Wallet and the CoinVerse are converted to BNUS before
being accumulated in the reward pool. These BNUS are then distributed as a reward for
a variety of contributions to the network.
The volume of BNUS issuance changes dynamically in line with both the growth of the
entire system and the supply and demand in the market. Since an additional issuance
of BNUS requires CNUS to be used as a reserve, a rise in the number of BNUS means
a decline in the amount of CNUS in circulation.
25




5.3. Bancor Price Determination Protocol for BNUS
05
The issuance and price of BNUS is in accordance with the Bancor protocol. BNUS are
Token Economy
priced by considering the CNUS reserve rate, the volume of existing BNUS, and the
reserve balance of CNUS.
(Bancor Protocol:   https://storage.googleapis.com/website-bancor/2018/04/
01ba8253-bancor_protocol_whitepaper_en.pdf)
BNUS price = CNUS reserve balance ÷ (Total BNUS issuance × CNUS reserve rate)
For example, if the CNUS reserve rate is 5%, the volume of the first BNUS issuance is
one million, and the CNUS reserve amounts to 50,000, then the starting price of BNUS
will be in parity with the price of CNUS (1 BNUS = 1 CNUS).
The table above shows the volume of BNUS tokens issued and the pricing of CNUS
tokens when CNUS tokens go in as a reserve for BNUS issuance and when BNUS are
canceled and CNUS tokens are released from the reserve. The reserve rate and the
volume of the first issuance in the table are just examples for explanation, and the actual
figures to be used will be made public before a contract which meets the Bankor proto-
col is issued. A portion of the first BNUS issued will also be invested in the expansion of
the CoinUs Wallet and the CoinVerse ecosystem.
Individual investors can pay CNUS to have BNUS issued, in which case 10% of the
CNUS tokens become fees. When they cancel their BNUS tokens and convert them
into CNUS tokens, the same percentage of CNUS tokens must be paid as fees too. Fifty
percent of these paid CNUS tokens are distributed to BNUS owners in proportion to their
holdings, while the remaining 50% are moved to the CNUS stability fund contract, which
will be explained in further detail later.
26




05
BNUS issuance and pricing are based on the Bancor protocol for the following reasons:
Token Economy
Since CNUS tokens are used as a reserve when issuing BNUS tokens, their
circulation volumes are decreased, and this prevents their prices from declining.
A billion CNUS tokens assigned for network rewards and marketing are used as
a reserve for the BNUS issuance instead of being released to the market. This
controls the direct supply of CNUSes and helps to stabilize CNUS prices. During
this reward process, BNUS prices could go up, which translates into more ben-
efits to network contributors.
An internal automated process rather than an external market determines the
exchange rate between CNUS and BNUS. Not only is this scheme convenient,
but it also ensures transparency because it allows one to predict prices from
changes in transaction volume.
As the CoinUs network grows, the volume of fees which go to the reward pool
also rises, bringing up BNUS prices in the process. This mechanism eliminates
the need for additional reward arrangements and makes it easier to capture in-
creases in network value, which in turn benefits long-term BNUS holders.
The volume of BNUS tokens changes automatically in accordance with network
growth, removing the need for artificial interventions to control the volume.
BNUS tokens can always be converted into CNUS tokens regardless of market
liquidity, and this is because the system itself serves as a market maker even if
there is no entity that wants to buy BNUS tokens.
27




5.4. CNUS Supply Control Mechanism
05
There are benefits to using CNUS tokens as a reserve for BNUS issuance, but there is
Token Economy
also a flipside: If the network grows too fast and the demand for BNUS rises dramatical-
ly, an excessive volume of CNUS tokens could be held as a reserve, leading to a lack of
CNUS which are needed for accessing services.
If, by contrast, there is a hike in demand for BNUS cancellation in order to receive CNUS
tokens, CNUS prices may drop significantly due to oversupply. This is where the CNUS
supply control mechanism comes in.
If out-of-circulation CNUS tokens which are either held as a Bancor contract re-
serve or staked for other purposes exceed 75% of the total issuance, additional
CNUS tokens may be issued periodically to bring the number down to 75% or
less. Actual rates will be determined before the contract launch by taking into
account the outcome of simulations.
Investors have to pay a 10% fee in CNUS when they buy or sell BNUS tokens
through the Bancor contract, and half of this fee goes to the CNUS stability fund
contract. If there is an excessive supply of CNUS tokens during a certain period,
some of the CNUS tokens in the fund will be converted into BNUS tokens to
preserve BNUS prices and discourage conversion into CNUS tokens.
5.5. How to Acquire CNUS
Users can obtain CNUS by purchasing them on an exchange, buying them from other
holders, or by the following methods:
Transactions with other CNUS holders
Users can receive CNUS tokens in exchange for providing goods and services to
other users. They can do so either by registering as a seller or provider with the
community commerce market on the CoinVerse platform or by performing direct
peer-to-peer transactions. If users choose to leverage the market, the platform may
charge sellers fees for using its marketing and payment tools.
Fees for CNUS/BNUS conversion
Users pay a 10% fee for CNUS/BNUS conversion on the Bancor contract. BNUS
token holders receive these fees as a reward in proportion to their BNUS holdings.
28




5.6. CNUS Usages
05
CNUSes are used in the CoinVerse for the following purposes:
Token Economy
A stake for creating a CoinVerse community
[Picture 7] CNUS: Wallet Network Stake
CNUS tokens can be used as a stake for creating a CoinVerse community. The staking                               volume determines the size
of the community, which is dissolved if the stake is redeemed. The limit on community                            size for a certain volume of
the stake does not remain the same, and it may go up or down depending on the circumstances. However, the max-
imum sizes allowed for existing communities cannot be reduced unless they redeem their stakes.
29




05
A payment tool in the CoinVerse community market
Token Economy
CNUS tokens may be used as a payment tool for buying products and services in
the CoinVerse. The payment feature of the CoinUs Wallet allows users to convert
other cryptocurrencies in the Wallet into CNUS tokens in real time if they are short
on CNUS tokens for payment in the CoinVerse community market.
A tool for paying marketing fees in CoinVerse communities
When marketers promote external products and services such as advertisements,
airdrops, and ICOs to CoinVerse communities, they can use CNUS tokens to pay
fees for using the CoinVerse platform. The platform redistributes these fees to Co-
inVerse communities and BNUS holders first.
5.7. Methods of Acquiring BNUS
Users can acquire BNUS tokens through one of the following methods:
[Picture 8] BNUS token flow
30




05
Using the CNUS/BNUS conversion contract
Token Economy
Users can obtain BNUS tokens by sending CNUS tokens to the CNUS-BNUS con-
version contract to have BNUS tokens issued. They have to pay a 10% fee in CNUS
tokens during this process.
Contributing to network growth by creating a community team
Rewards are granted periodically from the BNUS reward pool when users create a
CoinVerse community team and either sign up new users or induce them to increase
their usage of the CoinVerse, thus contributing to the network’s growth. The amount
of reward is in proportion to the rise in contribution volume, which is measured by
such factors as the amount of CNUS tokens staked by the community team, the
team’s size, and the achievements made by the team within a given period.
[Picture 9] BNUS reward in accordance with contributions to the network
31




5.8. Reward Balancing for Long-Term Investment and
Contribution to Network Growth                                                               05
Token Economy
Network growth is highly likely to bring the market price of BNUS tokens up. Although
long-term holding for such price gains helps BNUS prices increase, the concentration
of BNUS tokens and the rewards from network growth in a small number of users is not
conducive to the ecosystem’s growth.
There are two approaches to addressing this issue: One is to modify the scheme of dis-
tributing rewards, which may be concentrated on dominant BNUS holders; and the other
is to prevent the concentration of BNUS ownership by making it more expensive to hold
BNUS tokens in a way that does not contribute to sustaining and growing the network.
The CoinVerse will be designed to run on a protocol which allows the concentration
of BNUS holdings only when such concentration contributes to the sustainment and
growth of the network. In other words, we will make sure that the most cost-efficient
success strategy is to contribute to a sound growth of the network, which we value most.
The following is an example of this type of design. Note that the actual design during the
implementation phase may differ from this.
Limits on Pocket Size
A Wallet network is created by CNUS tokens that users send to the network. In propor-
tion to the percentage of their CNUS stakes, they are assigned a set of credits dubbed
“pocket size,” which are the share of the network’s contribution volume that they are
entitled to.
The pocket size determines the user’s share of the BNUS reward which is assigned to
the network by the platform and the volume of BNUS tokens that they can hold without
paying platform fees.
[Picture 10] Pocket sizes and the corresponding rewards in proportion to the network stake
The pocket size is an absolute number of credits which are granted in accordance with
the contribution to network growth made by individual Wallet users who are on a network
at a given time. It is measured in terms of the number of credits. Among the BNUS to-
kens stored in the Wallet in question, those that exceed the pocket size are automatically
sent to the Bancor protocol and converted into CNUS tokens.

Airdrop or ICO marketers can use the Wallet user networks by paying fees in CNUS
tokens, while these networks are assigned airdrops and opportunities to participate in
ICOs in proportion to their sizes.

The CNUS Wallet Network is a payment network which is connected to exchanges.
Marketers can sell their products and services in the community commerce market of
the network by staking their CNUS tokens, while the Wallet user network is automatically
assigned discounts and incentives from the staked tokens in accordance with sales
volumes.

Token Economy   DEX Network
CNUS is a token provided by the CoinUs Wallet, a multi-cryptocurrency wallet service,
in conjunction with decentralized exchanges (DEX). It is used to pay crypto transaction
fees between Wallet users. Users get fee discounts when they pay transaction fees with
CNUS tokens, and the Wallet user network receives a portion of such transaction fees.

Through the networks which they belong to, Wallet users receive airdrops and ICOs
from other ICO projects, get discounts or paybacks on products, and pay fees for DEX
transactions and make payments for their purchases with CNUS tokens.
Wallet users who have gone through the KYC process can receive additional discounts
depending on the configuration set by the marketer or the merchant. They also have
access to a variety of CoinVerse services such as AI-based asset management and
real-time currency exchanges in small amounts, which are enabled by exchange APIs.

In accordance with their CNUS stakes, Wallet network administrators or teams are grant-
ed the authority to issue a UUID to other users and include those who use a UUID that
they have issued as members of their networks.
CoinVerse community network administrators or teams receive platform incentives in
BNUS tokens in accordance with the growth in the contribution volume of the community

Marketers and merchants can sell their products and services on community networks
by staking a certain amount of CNUS tokens as incentives and paybacks.
They can view the outcome of their marketing activities in the form of a report, while the
staked tokens are automatically converted to BNUS tokens without incurring exchange
fees through the Bancor protocol, which is then paid to Wallet networks and their users
in accordance with the incentive and payback programs they have set.

Actor 4. BNUS Token Holders
BNUS token holders can convert their BNUS tokens into CNUS tokens by paying a
10% fee through the Bancor contract provided by the platform. In accordance with the
amount of their BNUS tokens, they receive 50% of the fees, which the platform gains
through the Bancor                                                                           contract, in CNUS tokens. They have to build or acquire an account
with a pocket size that can accommodate the amount of BNUS they want to hold. If the
amount exceeds the pre-determined limit, the Bancor protocol may be triggered in order
to convert the excess BNUS token into CNUS tokens.
