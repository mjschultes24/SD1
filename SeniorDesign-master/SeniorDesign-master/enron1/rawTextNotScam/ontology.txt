Ontology is a blockchain/distributed ledger
network which combines a distributed identity
system, distributed data exchange, distributed data
collaboration, distributed procedure protocols,
distributed communities, distributed attestation, and
various industry-specific modules. Together this builds
the infrastructure for a peer-to-peer trust network
which is cross-chain, cross-system, cross-industry,
cross-application, and cross-device.

PART I. TRUST SYSTEMS AND ONTOLOGY
Ontology's Ethos
Ontology has architected a distributed trust system. It
incorporates multiple trust types in an integrated protocol
system with various blockchains and databases. Multi-
source identities and multi-source data exchange protocols
have been implemented into the network, building a
distributed trust system that is cross-chain, cross-industry,
cross-system, cross-application, and cross-device.
Ontology aims to develop its trust ecosystem through
partnerships to provide distributed services including
distributed communities, data verification, data exchange,
and credit across industries.

PART I. TRUST SYSTEMS AND ONTOLOGY
Vision and Structure
Ontology’s Trust Network is a protocol network built with multiple
blockchains and systems to support use with all business types.
In order to meet the needs of different industries, the flexible
design structure is modularized, pluggable, and easily expandable.
Ontology applies blockchain technology to all business types,
providing blockchains, smart contracts, distributed verification
management, data exchange, and other protocols and APIs. Users
can easily develop distributed services through Ontology without
having previous knowledge of distributed networks.

Distributed Ledger Technology
Ontology’s storage system works on a distributed ledger. The key feature
of the completely decentralized, tamper-proof ledger is that trust is
shared amongst multiple parties through the use of smart contracts,
distributed networks, distributed storage, distributed authority,
distributed security, and a variety of modules.

Decentralized Inclusive Financial Services
Small businesses and individuals often lack credit records and collateral
while facing high operation costs. This makes them riskier for banks and
other financial institutions, leading to high interest rates. At the same
time the cost of change is high and businesses face retributions to their
reputation if they do not comply, leading to a multifaceted dilemma.
