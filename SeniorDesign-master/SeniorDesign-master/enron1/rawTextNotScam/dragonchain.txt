Dragonchain Commercial Platform
Version 6
September   2017
Copyright ©2017 Dragonchain
Background
Dragonchain was originally developed at Disney’s Seattle office in 2015 and 2016 as the Disney
Private Blockchain Platform. Over 20 use cases and applications1 were explored and documented
publicly  via  the  W3C  Blockchain  Community  Group2. The platform was later released as open
source software under the Apache 2 license in October of 2016.
Dragonchain simplifies the integration of real business applications onto a blockchain and provides
features such as easy integration, protection of business data and operations, currency agnosticism,
and multi-currency support.
The Dragonchain Foundation, a Non-Profit Corporation was created in January of 2017 to maintain
ownership and responsibility of the open source code.
The Dragonchain team is now in the process of launching a commercial entity to build a serverless
architecture blockchain platform, and an incubator. The combination of serverless and blockchain
technologies is unique and tremendously valuable. The timing of the Dragonchain platform launch is
highly strategic to benefit from explosive growth of cloud computing over the last few years and the
emerging wave of Blockchain solutions entering proof of concept stage across enterprises.
Vision
The Dragonchain team will launch Dragonchain, Inc., as a commercial entity to provide an array of
products  and  services  to  the  community.  Our  vision  supports  areas  of  the  market  that  are
underserved with strong demand and projected growth in the blockchain industry ($7.7b by 20243)
across  an  array  of  multi-billion  dollar  sectors  such  as  Arts,  Wine,  Automotive,  Legal,  Digital
Marketing,  etc.  These  sectors  and  more  will  experience  market  disruption  with  blockchain

Problem
Security on a Blockchain Platform
Data exposure and security is a known issue to large institutions wanting to leverage blockchain
technology, as they typically have very sensitive customer data that sometimes has regulatory
or legal risks associated  (e.g. banking, health, identity, etc.). The data exposure risk can be
somewhat alleviated by either obfuscation or separation, however, in both cases, this requires
extra design and development work up front, as well as reduces somewhat the utility of the
blockchain system itself.
A so far generally unrecognized risk in the use of blockchain technology is that associated with
the public exposure of smart contract logic as necessary on most blockchain platforms. The
smart contract is exposed and transparent which means that the team must implement very
sensitive proprietary business logic in a separate system. Also, any obfuscated data may be
unraveled by an interested viewer of transactions.
Most important however is the combined risk of exposed data and business logic, as it is the
equivalent of placing your operational system, all of your data, and a bounty of funds in the
public  domain.  Unlike  the  well  understood  and  successful  open  source  model,  where  the
discoverer of a flaw or vulnerability in utility software is incentivized to to fix the issue or notify
the community of its existence, in the case of a discovered vulnerability on a blockchain, the
discoverer is actually incentivized to attack the smart contract and withdraw funds or valuable
information.

Skill Set Challenge
Leveraging blockchain technology for real business initiatives is expensive and very risky in an
operational environment. This can be expected to result in low success rates as creation of
software without blockchain technology is already fraught with difficulty and the addition of a
relatively new technology such as blockchain with features such as cryptography, Proof of work,
economics, currency modeling, game theory, and custom programming languages is sure to
cause more trouble for a team as the overlap of these skills is particularly rare.
Dragonchain solves this problem by allowing development and integration before the economic
model is known. Monetization can be applied after a system is functioning and enough real data
is available for analysis.

Solution & Business Focus
When Dragonchain was originally launched, the team had several goals in mind based upon past
experience developing blockchain solutions:
●   Protection of Business Data and Processes
●   Ease of Integration
●   Simplified Development
●   RESTful Interfaces
●   Simple Architecture
●   Short, Fixed Length Block Time
●   No Base Currency
●   Currency Agnostic with Multi-Currency Support
●   Interoperability with other Blockchains
●   Adoption of Standards
The platform was designed for use in a wide variety of use cases and applications. It is particularly
useful in non-financial systems and in monetization and modeling of micro-economies for example to
replace political economies within an organization with transparent rules to incentivize productive or
otherwise valued behavior.
Verification and Consensus
In the open source Dragonchain Architecture document4, we introduced the concept of "context
based verification" wherein Dragonchain adds another dimension to the common blockchain model.
This new structure may be best thought of as a "blockchain of blockchains," where business nodes
handle approval of transactions based upon local and sometimes proprietary business logic.
The  Dragonchain  architecture  provides  five  standardized  levels  of  consensus  to  provide  a
spectrum of trust to consumers of data;
1.   Business (Approval) Verification
2.   Enterprise (Validation) Verification
3.   Network Diversity Verification
4.   External Partner (Notary) Verification
5.   Public Checkpoint Verification

©2017 Dragonchain                                                                                        Dragonchain Commercial Platform   v6   Page 5 of 15




As the verification level increases for a block, security increases, risk decreases, and measure of
risk becomes possible.
Level 1 Business Verification (Approval)
Analogous  to  other  blockchain  systems,  the  business  context  provides  localized  approval  of
transactions and operates primarily on a trust basis. Although a proof algorithm can be applied, it is
not necessary as data approved at this level can be considered trusted by the team that owns the
data and any other team that decides to trust that data. This may best be viewed as web services on
a blockchain, where developers familiar with web services or similar traditional services development
may productively leverage blockchain technology.
Use of this model has been shown to improve the blockchain technology learning curve, as well as
lower the risk of decentralized system development. A team can build atop the Dragonchain system
to integrate existing systems or add new capabilities without a full understanding of the economic
modeling that may later become valuable. That is, many projects have seen value by starting with
data transparency as a goal, followed by late binding to an economic model based upon historical
evidence.
Note that any data contained in the business defined payload of a transaction will not move
across the network unless explicitly authorized by the owner of a node(s).

Level 2 Enterprise Verification (Validation)
This  context  is  defined  Enterprise  or  network  wide,  and  checks  for  block  and  individual
transaction validity in form, signature, and required data elements. This can be considered as
providing                                                                                                 “Real-time  Enterprise  Governance”  with  rules  defined  at  the  Enterprise  level  for
validation of all transactions regardless of the local business data.
Level 3 Network Diversity Verification
A Level  3  node will verify diversity of validation (Level 2) verifications. This verification context
will  ensure  that  validations  of  transactions  are  coming  from  a  sufficiently  diverse  set  of
distributed sources. It also provides control and measurement of network effect and provides
distributed security as an attacker would be required to attack multiple systems, businesses,
and data centers in order to tamper with existing data.
Level 4 External Partner Verification (Notary)
A  level  4  node  will  provide  a notary functionality to the consensus process. Hosted by an
external partner, a level  4  node cryptographically signs any level  3  verification records that it
receives. This function allows the Level  4  node to act as an independent witness to level  3
verifications.
Level 5 Public Verification (Public Checkpoint)
A Level  5  node will provide a bridge to one or more public blockchains and allow clients to
interact with them (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.).
With this, Dragonchain is able to provide a spectrum of trust for the consumer of blockchain
data, where risk is accepted based upon a combination of real world contracts, reputation of
nodes, and trustless system assertions. That is, one may trust one’s own data as valid, but
require varying levels of consensus verification before accepting a partner or foreign node for
use. The system will provide a human readable report as well as API access to this capability.
Currency
Dragonchain is intentionally  “currency agnostic”. That is, the architecture defines the ability to
create  a  blockchain  without  currency,  or  with  one  or  more  currencies  in  place.  We've
experimented with and expect to make available interesting currency features.
See the Dragonchain open source architecture document for a full description of the currency
architecture.

Serverless Deployment
With the commercial launch of Dragonchain, Inc., we are leveraging the architecture of the
Dragonchain   platform   to   provide   a   serverless   blockchain   platform  for  business  use.
Dragonchain’s hybrid model allows a serverless approach, because the smart contracts are
executed in a traditional model and on a trusted node. A team can productively use the talents
of a traditional software engineer, along with best practices devops to build a system, whilst
leveraging the capabilities of blockchain technology.
We will initially launch on Amazon AWS, with the entire system using AWS Lambda services,
and with all user provisioned smart contracts deployed as Lambda services. Deployment in this
manner will provide to the user the full scaling capacity of the AWS platform as well as all
available services. In the future, we expect to port the system for deployment to Google App
Engine and Apache OpenWhisk for internal datacenter deployment.
Availability of Established Languages
With  this  arrangement,  and  due  to  the  abstraction  of  trust  provided  by  the  Dragonchain
architecture, the user has access to multiple full languages as supported by AWS5:
●   Python
●   Java
●   Node.js
●   C#
These languages are consistently ranked in the top  10  for usage in the real world in such
surveys and studies as Redmonk Programming Language Ratings6, Stack Overflow Developer
Survey7,  Github  Language  Trends8,  and  PYPL  Programming  Language  Popularity  Index9.
Availability of popular, established, and well understood languages for safe and secure use on a
blockchain is a valuable capability in convenience and risk to the team and for adoption of the
Dragonchain platform. Millions of active developers currently code fluently in one or more of
these languages and Dragonchain will provide an easy path for these developers toward the
use of blockchain technology.
Dragon Tokens
Dragon tokens  (AKA Dragons) represent a tokenized license for interaction with Dragonchain
commercial platform services. The tokens will be issued and provided to the public via an open

Utility
Dragons  will  be  used  by  developers  and  organizations  to  interact  with  the  Dragonchain
commercial  platform  products  and  services                                                           (e.g.  launch  nodes,  provision  smart  contracts,
access incubator dashboard, etc.). As a tokenized license with value in utility service rights, the
tokens will further allow individuals or organization to be rewarded in an open market for running
public or private nodes for network consensus.
Dragons will also be used to support projects in the DragonFund Incubator. They will provide
early access to technology and data from the projects, as well as allow first access to purchase
tokens for use on the developed platforms.
For  the  Dragonchain  Foundation,  the  maintainer  of  the  Dragonchain  open  source  code,
Dragons  will be used to reward and incentivize developers contributing to the open source
project and related projects. The tokens will be used to increase adoption in the developer
community with rewards and training. Community members will be able to contribute on issues
and  designs,  and  reward  active  participation  in  the  development  of  important  functionality
anywhere in the world.
