Money Supply of Safex Cash.  The main
function  for  Safex  Cash  is  to  act  as  an  in-
termediary instrument between parties,  that
is,  to  facilitate  the  business  of  the  market
by acting as a common medium of exchange
(Mises,  1953).  In order to achieve that goal,
it  should  meet  the  demand  for  currency  so
as to enable all transactions on the market-
place.   Taking into consideration that Safex

emission curve for Safex Cash is designed to
follow the rate of marketplace adoption.
