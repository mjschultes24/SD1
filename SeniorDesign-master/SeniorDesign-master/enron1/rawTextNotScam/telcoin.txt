CAUTIONARY NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This whitepaper contains certain forward-looking statements. A forward-looking statement is a
statement that does not relate to historical facts and events. The forward-looking statements are
based on analyses or forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable or
foreseeable. These statements appear in a number of places in this whitepaper and include
statements regarding Telcoin’s intent, belief or current expectations with respect to Telcoin’s
financial position, business strategies, plans and prospects and future prospects of the industry.
In many cases, but not all, forward-looking statements can be identified by forward-looking terms
such as “aim”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “intend”, “may”, “might”, “outlook”,
“plan”, “possibility”, “potential”, “probably”, “project”, “risk”, “seek”, “should”, “target”, “will” and
similar terms. These forward-looking statements are based on current estimates and assumptions
that Telcoin makes to the best of its present knowledge and are subject to risks, uncertainties and
assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying
assumptions prove incorrect, Telcoin’s actual results may vary materially from those currently
anticipated. Potential risks and uncertainties include, without limitation:"

Introducing Telcoin
Telcoin is a new cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum blockchain that will be distributed by your
national telecom operator and made available to everyone, anytime, anywhere. This is the core of
our business, and mobile network operators will be at the center of our strategy."
Telcoin is the first cryptocurrency to tap into synergies between the reach of mobile telecoms and
the fast, borderless nature of blockchain technology. According to the World Bank, there are
nearly five times as many mobile phones in the world (5 billion), as there are active bank accounts
(1.2 billion). 1It's a lot easier to access mobile phone services than banking services, and we aim
to capitalize on that disparity."
We will initially offer Telcoin to our mobile network partners, providing their customers with
seamless access to the digital economy: online remittances, transfers, payments, and e-
commerce. We will also provide the necessary marketing and product development resources to
nurture the Telcoin ecosystem, in a joint effort with our telecom partners. "
Our objective is not to compete with telecom mobile money, but to cooperatively participate in the
overall mobile money ecosystem. We see ourselves as a complementary solution; a tool that will
increasingly bring users to mobile money, cryptocurrency-backed solutions, and mobile wallets.
Our goal is to become one of the cornerstone financial inclusion efforts of the 21st century and
we want to cooperate with actors who we believe can play a critical role in this process, namely
mobile network operators."
Why Partner with Telecoms?
By partnering with mobile operators, Telcoin can avoid key points of friction that have prevented
similar projects from succeeding: trust, reach, and KYC compliance."
An estimated 1.2B adults have access to a bank account that is active and capable of making payments. (Only 22%   1
of adults (1.1B) have used a debit card (p20). Only 20% of adults (1B people) have accounts with more than two
withdrawals monthly (p18))   http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/187761468179367706/pdf/WPS7255.pdf
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                           PAGE   7OF 51




Trust
Cryptocurrencies suffer a major trust issue. The instantaneous nature of transactions is a double-
edged sword, and cryptocurrencies have been featured in numerous recent stories involving
hackers stealing funds. Telcoin strives to be a complementary partner in the cryptocurrency
ecosystem, and we hope to drive greater adoption of cryptocurrency in general, as many early
Telcoin users will likely use it as a doorway to purchase other cryptocurrencies. We are offering to
leverage telecoms’ existing trust level with customers to provide an easy bridge between mobile
money and cryptocurrency. "
As described in the Security Challenges section, default security for subscribers who convert
mobile money to Telcoin will involve a multi-signature wallet, preventing large Telcoin movements
without two of the three wallet keys. Telcoin will also work with telecoms to utilize all available
best practice security measures in order to protect subscribers. Furthermore, by focusing on
compliance efforts with telecoms, we don't expect Telcoin to attract criminal elements. We intend
to diligently maintain a clean image for Telcoin as a brand that can be trusted."
Reach
According to the GSM Association, more than 5 billion people have mobile phones. Reaching
potential users can be difficult and costly for any new business. Telcoin will create a symbiotic
relationship with telecoms in order to capitalize on their vast reach. By incentivizing mobile
operators to partner with us - through the issuance of Telcoin described in the Cryptocurrency
Details section - we will gain immediate access to their existing subscriber base. We will provide
incentives to telecoms, which will promote Telcoin in order to maximize their own revenue from
issuance."
We also feel that Telcoin will drive further adoption of mobile money by adding practical use
cases. Expanding mobile money adoption is a top priority of telecom CEOs in the developing
world, as it has proven to generate a higher return on investment (ROI) compared to allocations
for network infrastructure. Telecoms' global reach and their potential to spread digital financial
services is still largely untapped. As several cases in Africa have illustrated, once regulatory
barriers are removed, mobile phone users will rapidly adopt mobile financial services. 2"
We believe that now is the perfect time for Telcoin to enter the market. As regulation on both
mobile financial services and cryptocurrencies begin to loosen, Telcoin will undoubtedly benefit
from the reach of mobile operators."
KYC Compliance
Most exchanges now require a traditional bank account and a cumbersome “know your
customer” (KYC) authorization before allowing the purchase of any cryptocurrency. This is a major
drawback for companies working on the blockchain trying to address financial inclusion in

developing countries. By going with a telecom-distributed cryptocurrency, a certain amount of
KYC compliance is already in place. By working with regulatory compliance bodies to enable the
leveraging of existing telecom KYC processes, Telcoin hopes to ease this major friction point for
access to cryptocurrency."
Telecoms also have a significant technical advantage to be able to actually know their customer -
based on call detail records (CDRs), location-based services (LBS), and other network elements
that are already commonly leveraged by fraud management platforms. If a bank KYC form is not
accompanied with sound document validation processes, it would rely heavily on the word of the
customer filling out the form. The telecom operator, on the other hand, has real evidence
regarding the customer’s usage patterns. So it could be argued that a mobile operator’s ability to
perform effective KYC is actually far greater than a traditional bank’s ability to do so. Telcoin will
leverage existing telecom KYC in place for mobile money access and work with the telecoms to
meet standards required for cryptocurrency."
By partnering with telecoms, Telcoin strives to solve basic trust, marketing, and compliance
challenges that have inhibited cryptocurrency adoption to date. "
The Background Story
One of the primary observations that led our team to envision Telcoin is the widespread disparity
between access to financial services and access to telecom services. According to the World
Bank, 2 billion people are unbanked - meaning that more than 35 percent of the global adult
population still doesn't have access to basic financial services. 3That figure includes nearly half of
the developing world, a neglected segment that we hope empower.   "

Fortunately, a much larger portion of the global adult population has access to telecom services.
Nearly 5 billion adults - almost the entire global adult population - have a mobile phone.4"
Safaricom in Kenya provides the classic mobile money success story. In Kenya, 90 percent of the
adult population has a “bank account” according the the World Bank - nearly the level of high-
income OECD economies. 5How did they do it? Regulations in Kenya have allowed telecom
mobile money to flourish, and while only a small minority of Kenyans have traditional bank
accounts, they almost all have mobile money accounts. The majority of Kenyans would be
considered underbanked, as the usability of mobile money is still somewhat restricted. But as the
Kenya example has illustrated, regulators have played a major role in holding back financial
inclusion. "
Here is where Telcoin enters the picture. "
The Case for Telcoin
The borderless nature of cryptocurrencies is now placing increased pressure on regulators.
Monetary policy remains a national security priority - and banks a powerful lobby - but a wave of
interest in the future of cryptocurrencies is turning the tide.   Around the world, governments are
starting to accept cryptocurrencies, as the need to regulate them as a taxable asset is rapidly
outweighing any threat to monetary policy. "
We believe that once a telecom has regulatory approval to provide mobile money, and once the
government has provided a regulatory approval or legal framework for cryptocurrency as a
regulated taxable asset, there will be minimal regulatory barriers to a telecom establishing
exchange capability with Telcoin."
In this environment of increasing clarity regarding regulation, and growing excitement around
cryptocurrencies, we feel very confident in our ability to get a sizable number of telecoms to agree
to proof of concept partnerships. "
Working with Telecom Operators
As core telecom services are becoming commoditized, operators need to seek differentiators to
remain profitable and grow. Financial services are an important part of that growth picture and
cryptocurrency offers an opportunity to differentiate in the market. Telcoin aims to contribute to
the mobile financial services ecosystem as a complement to existing telecom mobile money
platforms. We believe that by offering subscribers easy access to Telcoin, we can help drive
greater usage of mobile money and increase mobile operator revenue."
Telcoin is realistic about the challenges associated with working with telecom operators. We
believe they are great business partners, but telecom relationships and project business cases
take time to develop - particularly in a new area with regulatory uncertainty like cryptocurrency.

TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                PAGE   1 OF 051




We are in various stages of discussion with many mobile network operator groups, and almost all
express excitement about cryptocurrency and the potential for Telcoin. Almost all of them also do
acknowledge the regulatory uncertainty and practical complexities surrounding any
cryptocurrency project, and thus request a proper process of study prior to deploying a pilot
project. We have also realized that dealing with central banks can greatly ease the process of
obtaining approval for a pilot project with a mobile network operator. For this reason, Telcoin has
developed a two-track approach to rolling out access to Telcoin and associated use cases and
products. These two tracks are developing in parallel, and depend on each other for success."
Track One - Aggregators (Airtime and Mobile Money)
For Telcoin to be successful, we believe that rapid access to all telecoms globally is necessary. If
Telcoin relied on establishing direct partnerships with all telecoms in the world, this goal of rapid
access would not be practical. So we are working with global, regional, and local aggregators to
initially connect to as many telecom airtime and mobile money platforms globally as possible.
Along with crypto wallet and outbound “cash in” remittance partners, this will allow Telcoin to
rapidly deliver an end-to-end product for Telcoin access. We can also then rapidly deploy
products on top of this basic access, namely remittance and card payments, as soon as partners
can be identified in key markets to facilitate regulatory compliance."
In many remittance corridors today, “cash out” with mobile operators occurs via mobile airtime
just as much if not more than via fiat currency in mobile money accounts. Our goal is to as quickly
as possible enable the ability to send Telcoin to any mobile phone number in the world. To this
end, we are establishing connections to airtime platforms via aggregators, while going through the
process of securing mobile money connection capability in each market. "
Regulatory and banking complications of mobile money connectivity are not the only reason to
first connect to airtime platforms. In very important financial inclusion markets like Nigeria, for
example, where mobile money adoption is extremely low, converting Telcoin to airtime can
actually be much more effective than connecting to mobile money."
The case for telecom partnership is made much easier when Telcoin is able to deliver a working
solution in parallel or even prior to negotiating direct partnerships with telecoms."
Track Two - Telecom Partnerships
The Telcoin strategy is to provide coin issuance as an incentive to promote greater adoption of
Telcoin by an operator’s subscribers. By already connecting to operators globally via aggregators,
Telcoin can easily approach operators in a prioritized fashion, based on level of Telcoin demand in
each market. Telcoin will begin with a proof of concept (POC) trial agreement to demonstrate how
direct connection and cooperation will enhance the user experience, expand possible use cases,
quantify amount of Telcoin issuance that the operator would receive, and provide an executive
summary of the overall business case."
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                 PAGE   1 OF 151




As a deliverable to mobile operators from a POC agreement, Telcoin provides a demonstration of
the technical feasibility of the requested Telcoin Use Cases, which may include:"
•                                                                                                      Exchange Demonstration - conversion to and from Telcoin and Partner mobile money (and/or
prepaid or postpaid balance) via the Partner API or other method requested by the Partner."
•                                                                                                      Remittance Demonstration - remittance to or from foreign mobile network(s) requested by the
Partner and identified as attractive remittance corridors."
•                                                                                                      Airtime Top-up Demonstration - purchase and transfer of Partner airtime using Telcoin."
•                                                                                                      Card Payment Demonstration - Visa card payment using Telcoin for retail product or service."
•                                                                                                      Other Telcoin Use Cases and Capabilities - other demonstrations available upon request
depending on market and partner priorities; see Telcoin Use Cases section below."
Cryptocurrency is still very new and faces regulatory and compliance challenges. As part of the
POC, Telcoin also conducts a survey of regulatory feasibility, communicating with the appropriate
regulators in cooperation with the mobile operator. Telcoin also provides a report to the mobile
network detailing the results of the POC, a business case summary, and an actionable project
implementation plan for moving forward."
Commercial Model
Mobile operators will benefit from Telcoin as a differentiator in the market that attracts customers
interested in access to cryptocurrency and other Telcoin use cases, including sending and
receiving remittances and inbound and outbound roaming payments. Mobile operators can
presumably also benefit from increased adoption of their mobile money. Telcoin is positioning
itself as a partner of telecoms in the overall mobile payments ecosystem that will increase the
usefulness of mobile money and drive further adoption."
Telcoin will benefit from a transaction fee applied when subscribers buy or sell Telcoin from their
mobile operator. At the point of conversion, from mobile money or telecom credit to Telcoin, a
transaction fee of 0.5 percent will be applied."
We also plan to benefit from exchange spreads when a mobile operator decides to buy or sell
Telcoin to/from us in exchange for local currency. If a network’s subscribers are buying as much
Telcoin as they are selling, they would not need to exchange Telcoin with us, as their issuance
balance would provide the necessary liquidity. If there is an imbalance, for instance from net
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                PAGE   1 OF 251




inbound or outbound remittances, Telcoin would need to apply a spread to manage risks
including forex risk and Telcoin secondary market volatility risk. Spreads will depend on currency
markets, the degree of forex imbalance, and the liquidity and volatility of Telcoin on secondary
markets, but will be designed in a conservative manner and generate a modest profit margin from
this activity."
Telcoin Exchange API
Telcoin will offer a flexible application programming interface, the Telcoin Exchange API, to
provide operators a number of integration options. Initial implementations will focus on simple
connectivity to existing mobile money APIs. We will support any mobile network or third party
wallet, enabling us to rapidly deliver an end-to-end solution. With our mission of financial inclusion
in mind, Telcoin will work diligently to support feature phones as well, via native/SIM apps, SMS,
and USSD."

Telcoin Use Cases and Capabilities
There are a number of use cases for telecom-focused cryptocurrency, but Telcoin will initially
focus on tapping into the US$500B remittance market. Remittances are the first actual direct use
case where Telcoin sees feasible market entry opportunity. From the perspective of a mobile
operator seeking to differentiate itself in the market, there is also case for simply providing access
to cryptocurrency.   We believe that early adopting networks that enable easy access to Telcoin
can benefit from a growing population of consumers who are demanding access to
cryptocurrency."

Cryptocurrency Details
Telcoin Blockchain and Supply
Technically speaking, Telcoin is a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. We decided to favor
an ERC20 Token over bootstrapping our own blockchain because of the trust that already exists
with Ethereum. We do however understand that Ethereum comes with known challenges. The
most commonly used language for writing smart contracts (Solidity) is notoriously difficult to make
completely secure. Ethereum transaction fees (“gas”) also present an unknown, as they could
increase over time. In general, though, we feel that the pros of leveraging the existing Ethereum
blockchain outweigh the cons. Using Ethereum leverages the collective security of all tokens
using Ethereum, and makes it easy to connect to cryptocurrency exchanges and make Telcoin
available everywhere. So while we are open to building our own blockchain in the future, we have
chosen to start with Ethereum."
In considering supply, we prioritized the fact that Telcoin is focused on solving the problem of
global financial inclusion. We consider it important to set a currency denomination that will be
usable in the developing world. Most cryptocurrency denominations have focused on value
perception. But from the perspective of usability, particularly in the developing world, having 100
currency units is much easier to manage than having 0.001 currency units. For this reason, Telcoin
will define a relatively large total supply of 100 billion coins, but will not have as many decimal
subdivisions as Bitcoin or Ethereum - we will stop at 2, so 0.01 Telcoin. On the surface, the
amount is large, but in reality there are fewer Telcoins than there are Wei or Satoshi."
What is an ERC20 Token?
An ERC20 Token is a cryptographic asset issued on the Ethereum blockchain that implements
basic features in order to be compatible with existing software such as wallets and exchanges.
Those features, illustrated in the visual below, are defined in a piece of software called a smart
contract, which resides on the blockchain. They allow the token to be issued and traded between
users."
Some smart contracts implement additional features, like token destruction, special rights,
securities linked to real world objects, and much more. All the operations happening on a smart
contract residing on the Ethereum blockchain are counted using a separate Ethereum currency
called gas and paid for in Ethereum. What this essentially means is that transferring tokens
between users has a cost that should be accounted for, although it is actually very small.    "
What makes Telcoin different from other ERC20 tokens?
Telcoin is going to be sold to purchasers during the initial token sale, and then offered at no
charge to partner mobile operators. Technically, the supply of coins intended for telco issuance
will be issued to Telcoin Pte Ltd, and then offered to telecoms at a rate depending on their stage
of Telcoin integration, as described below in the Telcoin Issuance Model. This simple model
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                               PAGE   1 OF 551




minimizes barriers and risks for operators to partner with us, and will thus accelerate Telcoin
adoption. "
Operators' supply will be an asset of the operator - technically a Telcoin wallet that belongs to the
operator but is managed by Telcoin. Once the operator has fully connected with Telcoin, the
operator will have the right to withdraw Telcoin funds at any time from this managed wallet (or to
exchange between Telcoin and local currency).   "
The purpose of the operator supply wallet is to provide liquidity for users who want to buy Telcoin,
so an incentive will be provided for the operator to maintain a certain level of balance in the wallet.
This issuance model, as described in the following section, is the strongest differentiator of
Telcoin. "
A usable cryptocurrency - how will Telcoin work?
As it is the case with any ERC20 token, Telcoin will be available to anyone with an access to the
Ethereum blockchain. What makes Telcoin different is that users will be able to access it using
their mobile operators, so in order for other wallets to integrate fully with Telcoin, their developers
will need to integrate with more than the cryptocurrency itself, but with the Telcoin system."
The Telcoin building blocks
The starting point for the Telcoin ecosystem is of course the end user. Regarding the users, their
wallets, and their crypto addresses:"
•  The users have access to mobile money or another form of payment coming from their link with
their mobile operator."
•  The users wallets, if fully integrated with Telcoin, will provide integration with the Telcoin API, giving
access to payments solutions provided by operators."
•  The users addresses are, by default, multi-signature wallets with three private keys."
•  The users default addresses will have one private key stored encrypted on their devices, one key
stored encrypted by their mobile operator, and one key stored encrypted by Telcoin."
•  A subset of transactions made from the users addresses (for example, large amount of Telcoin
moved) will need to be signed by two of the three keys."
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                         PAGE   1 OF 651




Regarding the Telcoin wallets of the mobile operators:"
•  Mobile operators will receive their allowed Telcoin supply in multi-signature wallets that have at
least two private keys. One being stored by Telcoin, and one being stored by the operator."
•  In order to simplify management, the mobile network operator wallets will be managed by Telcoin,
unless otherwise requested by the operator, over an API Telcoin will provide to the operators."
Regarding Telcoin:"
•  Telcoin will store user's phone numbers (as it is their identifier with their operator), the public key of
their addresses, and one of the encrypted private key to their wallets."
These building blocks provide a solid foundation for a secure use of Telcoin. "
Selected use-cases
When a user registers using a fully compliant wallet, they will authenticate with their mobile money
provider via SMS and Telcoin will then generate the appropriate addresses, private keys, and
store the relevant information in a secure way. If the user is not a subscriber of a supported
network, the fully compliant wallets will still allow their users to generate a regular blockchain
address, as Telcoin is an ERC20 token. "
When a user wishes to buy Telcoin, they will first spend their mobile money. Once this mobile
money transaction is confirmed, the operator will order Telcoin to move coins to the user’s
address. A more fully integrated experience would even allow the user to tap their mobile money
directly from the wallet app."
When a user wishes to send Telcoin to another user, for the sake of a better user experience, in
addition to allow sending coins to a regular public key, a fully integrated wallet will provide the
option to enter a phone number or to pick it from their address book. If the recipient is already a
Telcoin user, they will be known by Telcoin and the coins will be sent automatically to the
corresponding address. If the recipient is not a Telcoin user, but is a subscriber on a supported
network, Telcoin will simply generate a temporary address behind the scenes and have the
recipient receive an SMS with very simple instructions to get access to their money by installing a
supported wallet. In case the recipient does not subscribe to a supported network, an error will be
returned and no coins will be sent."
When trying to send money using their default settings, if the sum is above a certain threshold
we’ll decide in function of various parameters such as their location, the user will be prompted to
authenticate with Telcoin using two factors of authentication. If they never authenticated this way,
they will be prompted to create a Telcoin account at that moment. This will protect them in cases
like sim-jacking or stolen phones."
A Telcoin user that wishes to send coins to a public key instead of a phone number will obviously
have this possibility, but less protection against sending coins to a dormant address (and then
losing the money), which should in theory not be possible when sending Telcoin to a phone
number."
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                         PAGE   1 OF 751




The most common cases will not require any special action, and only heavier actions like large
money movements will trigger higher levels of security. This allows us to offer a secure, yet
convenient experience to a large amount of users, while still being an open ecosystem on the
blockchain and being wallet-agnostic."
Telcoin Issuance Model
In order to support the adoption, promotion, and integrity of Telcoin, an issuance model has been
established to incentivize partner mobile networks."
Cryptocurrencies typically ensure the integrity of their blockchain by allowing public mining, which
amounts to members of the public competing to process blockchain transactions as fast as
possible in exchange for receiving newly minted cryptocurrency coins. In addition to
autonomously powering the blockchain, this public mining “proof of work” algorithm for
distributed consensus protects it from malicious attack (as any blockchain hack would require
simultaneously compromising more than half of the global mining operations). While this proof of
work model works well for a purely autonomous blockchain, it has presented scalability issues
and requires a significant amount of electricity. Cryptocurrencies based on purely autonomous
blockchains also struggle to comply with “know your customer” (KYC) requirements intended for
anti-money laundering (AML), combatting the financing of terrorism (CFT), and fraud management
(FM)."
Telcoin will implement an alternative “proof of stake” algorithm for issuance, whereby only GSM
Association Full Member mobile network operators and their virtual network partners (MVNOs) will
have a right to be issued Telcoin. Instead of an inefficient competition between telecoms,
issuance rights will depend on stages of Telcoin integration.   "
Half of all Telcoin supply will be set aside for mobile network issuance at a linear rate of five
percent annually based on the following model for issuance rights:"
Telcoin Integration Stages
1.   Connect with Telcoin (10%)"
•  Equal right to any MNO that establishes
Exchange Capability with Telcoin"
2.   Validate Network Size (10%)"
•  Proportional rights to MNOs based on network
size and capacity"
3.   Telcoin Exchange Volume (50%)"
•  Based on volume of Telcoin exchange between
Telcoin and MNO subscribers"
4.   Compliance Maturity (30%)"
•  Compensates MNOs for compliance efforts
(KYC, AML/CFT, FM, etc.)"
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                PAGE   1 OF 851




Telcoin issuance rights criteria and calculation will be subject to change and updated periodically,
with the underlying goal of maintaining an optimal balance between adoption incentive and
distribution fairness."
Integration stage percentages above reflect the share that each individual stage carries in the
weighted calculation of issuance rights. Issuance rights will be metered daily but calculated and
issued initially on a monthly basis, gradually shifting toward a more real-time issuance system."
Telcoin issuance to a mobile network operator will never exceed the amount of Telcoin actually
sold by the operator in any given period."
Connecting with Telcoin - 10% weighting"
Telcoin will define connectivity as “Exchange Capability,” meaning the technical capability for the
mobile network’s subscribers to be able to use telecom methods, including SMS, USSD, and/or
smart-phone applications to effect the exchange of local currency and/or telecom services credit
for Telcoin and vice versa. Exchange Capability will be provisioned via the Telcoin Exchange API,
described in the section below."
Validating Network Size - 10% weighting
While with connection issuance rights, all networks are equal, this second 10 percent weighting
takes into consideration the size of the network. Mobile network sizes, in terms of active
subscribers and actual traffic volume, are extremely subjective, and public reporting is notoriously
unreliable. In the interest of fairness, Telcoin will publish simple software tools for measuring the
precise size of a mobile network, based on call detail record (CDR) metering of volume of voice,
SMS, and data traffic on the network. Metering tools will be continually assessed and updated to
account for possible abuse scenarios. Telecoms will be able to install these software tools
themselves, which would output to a Telcoin issuance metering private cloud API. Additional
weighting will be provided to more advanced network technologies (4G/LTE vs 3G/2G)."
Telcoin Exchange Volume - 50% weighting
Exchange volume will be the most important criteria, counting for half of the overall issuance
rights. Telcoin Exchange Volume will be defined as the total volume of Telcoin sold to a network’s
subscribers in exchange for mobile money or telecom credit, and incurring a transaction fee to
Telcoin. Only transactions into and out of the mobile network’s wallet (managed by Telcoin) will be
subject to a Telcoin transaction fee and count toward Exchange Volume. All other Telcoin
transactions will only be subject to applicable Ethereum fees to power the Telcoin smart contract.
Any abusive dumping or arbitrage manipulation practice, for example the sale of Telcoin at a price
below the offered Telcoin price, would not be counted towards exchange volume issuance rights.
Telcoin will reserve the right to sanction or withhold issuance rights in the case of any abusive
pricing or marketing practices."
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                 PAGE   1 OF 951




Compliance Maturity - 30% weighting
Telcoin considers compliance a top priority for establishing trust with consumers, networks, and
regulatory authorities. Compliance will generally address any factors that contribute to the
integrity and marketability of Telcoin. Most prominent will be that the network perform some
acceptable degree of “know your customer” (KYC) compliance. Basic monitoring and
enforcement in accordance with international conventions on anti-money laundering (AML),
counter financing of terrorism (CFT), and fraud management (FM) will be expected of every
participating mobile network. Telcoin will establish a protocol for assessing compliance maturity
levels in order to determine compliance issuance rights. The goal is to essentially fund network
compliance efforts via Telcoin issuance, which will all work to increase the viability, adoption, and
value of Telcoin. Other possible compliance factors that may be considered include liquidity
reserve levels, risk management, and any other factor that impacts the integrity of Telcoin as a
brand and cryptocurrency. Compliance maturity weighting is only applicable proportional to
exchange volume levels. For example, a compliant network with no actual exchange volume
would not have any issuance rights from compliance maturity. Telcoin will reserve the right to
withhold issuance rights for networks that do not reach compliance within a reasonable
timeframe, for the purpose of taking proactive measure to mitigate the non-compliance on behalf
of the entire system."
Partial Exchange Capability
Weighted rights will be granted for partial Exchange Capability. During the proof of concept (POC)
phase, by simply agreeing to engage in a POC the network will receive 10 percent of their
connection issuance rights. Then, during the implementation phase, a telecom might be able to
quickly get regulatory approval to accept inbound exchange but may require more time for
outbound exchange approval. If a telecom only enables inbound exchange but not outbound
exchange, they would receive 30 percent of their connection issuance rights. All partial Exchange
Capability issuance will be accumulated in escrow and only released to the mobile network upon
achieving full Exchange Capability."
Telecom Transaction Fees or Taxes
In order to maximize the attractiveness and adoption of Telcoin, we will encourage mobile
networks to not apply any transaction fee on top of the standard Telcoin and Ethereum
transaction fees. Telecoms would, however, have the right to apply fees and Telcoin will not
attempt to prevent this or otherwise fix pricing.   In some cases telecoms may feel compelled to, at
least for a trial period of time, apply some sort of fee in order to protect existing mobile money
revenues. Telcoin will deduct the sum of any applied fees or taxes, or other premium cost for
obtaining Telcoin, from the the issuance amount - thereby creating a zero sum situation and
supporting effort to keep prices as low as possible for consumers. We feel that this policy will
make Telcoin attractive for regulators and consumer advocates."
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                 PAGE   2 OF 051




Partnership Overhead and Marketing
Telcoin will cooperate with mobile operators to most efficiently maintain the partnership
administratively and technically, and to most effectively market Telcoin to end users. Telcoin will
reserve the right to offset partnership overhead - including account management, administrative,
and technical costs - against Telcoin issuance in an amount not exceeding ten percent of total
issuance rights. Telcoin will also reserve the right to offset marketing costs specifically earmarked
for the partner operator’s market against Telcoin issuance, not exceeding ten percent of total
issuance rights. "
Issuance Rights from non-Telecom Exchange Volumes
We will seek to maximize the marketing of Telcoin via mobile network operators to the extent
possible. To this end, only GSMA full member operators will be eligible for Telcoin issuance. Given
the low penetration of mobile money in the developed world - the typical origination point for
remittances - however, we acknowledge that at least in the beginning we will need to rely heavily
on traditional cash-in partners (banks and remittance agents) in order to sell Telcoin. In order to
support this, the portion of issuance rights for Telcoin Exchange Volume and Compliance Maturity
will only be distributed for the proportion of Telcoin that is sold by mobile network operators for
any given period. Issuance for Telcoin Exchange Volume and Compliance Maturity for the
proportion of Telcoin that is sold via non-telecom channels will be withheld by Telcoin Pte. Ltd. for
the purpose of (a) offsetting the costs of marketing and compliance associated with the sale of
Telcoin via non-telecom channels, and (b) business development and technical integration costs
associated with increasing the proportion of Telcoin sold via mobile network operators."
The Telcoin issuance model will be subject to change at any time, and Telcoin will adapt the
model as necessary to best support the growth and adoption of Telcoin.

is ripe for disruption. The space also offers a great deal of
potential collaboration with telecoms."
In 2016, global remittances totaled more than US$500 billion. 7Despite having enormous market
reach, telecoms have a relatively small footprint in the remittance space. Most telecoms with
mobile money offerings have made an effort to partner with foreign banks and other entities on
the originating end of major remittance corridors, but remittances into mobile money accounts still
make up a tiny fraction of the overall market. As of December 2016, mobile money remittances
accounted for an annualized US$2.9 billion - telecoms are currently involved in less then one
percent of global remittances.8"
Telcoin sees remittances as a great area to cooperate with telecoms. Mobile money has been very
successful with on-net, peer-to-peer transfers and bill payments, but not with remittances.
Telcoin can only help mobile networks in this area and will not be viewed as a competitive threat.
We envision Telcoin actually increasing mobile money involvement in remittances and also driving
further mobile money adoption."
Business Model
Telcoin will not charge a specific fee for remittances. We will simply apply a 0.5 percent
transaction fee for conversions between Telcoin and mobile money. So Telcoin fees would amount
to a total of 1 percent for a remittance between a mobile money user in one country to transfer to
a mobile money user in another country."

There is a wide range of estimates, depending on how exactly a mobile payment is defined. In China alone at more
than $5T in mobile payments last year, using the loosest definition of mobile payments to include peer to peer transfers
and C2C sales payments. https://www.ft.com/content/e3477778-2969-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c"
Global non-cash payments last year amounted to more than 433 billion transactions, presumably most via a mobile
device. https://www.worldpaymentsreport.com/#non-cash-payments-content

There will also be a small Ethereum transaction fee for every Telcoin transfer (Ethereum gas),
which varies but is currently around US$0.25 per transaction - a negligible amount in terms of a
remittance fee. The Ethereum fee is high enough to provide a level of comfort for telecoms that
their “bread and butter” on-net peer-to-peer mobile money transfers are not threatened by the
Telcoin business model."
For a US$200 remittance, a user would only pay a $2.25 fee, or 1.125%, significantly less than the
global average cost of remittances which stands at 7.42%.9"
Of the 7.42% average, approximately 1-2% is a result of currency exchange rate spreads, which
vary from market to market but are generally consistent for each individual corridor. Telcoin
expects to be on the low end of exchange rate spread costs compared to other providers, as
explained in the Liquidity Management section below, resulting in a total average cost of
approximately 2.5% (or nearly one third) of the market average.   "
Competitive Analysis
Despite numerous new digital competitors, Western Union remains the dominant player in the
remittance world. There is little evidence, however, that Western Union and other incumbents will
be dislodged by competitive fees alone. 1 Convenience and brand appear to be significant 0
barriers to entry. By keeping up with digital offerings, Western Union has been able to maintain
market position even while being several percentage points more expensive than startup
alternatives."
Telcoin's positioning as compared to the competition, including new lower cost startups like
Transferwise, is a pure convenience play. Mobile money is more convenient than connecting your

bank account to an online service or going to a physical outlet. By partnering with telecoms and
leveraging mobile money infrastructure, we will be able to offer a service that is not only price
competitive but also disruptive from a convenience standpoint. "
Telcoin User Journey
While most incumbent money remittance services have digital options for connecting a bank
online, the process requires one or two business days to connect. Once sent, the sender either
needs to agree to require as much as five business days or agree to a higher transfer fee. The
recipient then needs to go to a physical outlet to receive the money, requiring time for completing
a form to receive the transfer. After all of that effort and time, the recipient is left with an average
of around 8% less than what was sent, for a US$200 transfer. Below depicts a US$1,000 transfer. "
In t
cos
More importantly, however, Telcoin will be instantaneous and far more convenient, traveling
directly from mobile money to mobile money - and instantly spendable by the recipient. Initially
users will be able to use partner wallets on both sides, to convert money into and out of mobile
money and to send Telcoin. We will also provide a Telcoin wallet and work with telecoms to enable
converting and sending directly from any existing mobile money wallet."
Liquidity Management
Liquidity is a challenge for any cryptocurrency, particularly one focused on international
remittances. With the issuance model described in the section above, Telcoin has a major
advantage over other cryptocurrencies. We expect the Telcoin issuance model to both alleviate
Telcoin liquidity pressure and incentivize mobile network operators to keep transaction fees at a
minimum. Telcoin has also set aside five percent of supply for a liquidity fund to be available for
sale to telecoms with demand for Telcoin that exceeds their issuance supply. They always have
the possibility to buy from market exchanges, but we will also offer this possibility. We will also
allow them to borrow Telcoin from this pool when they need to meet unexpected demands, but
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                    PAGE   2 OF 451




we will limit this possibility in order to prevent aggressive speculative behaviors. Mobile network
operators will have a certain degree of freedom with their Telcoin issuance allocation, but we will
set limits to Telcoin resale on exchange markets for obvious ethical reasons but also because we
believe this kind of behavior wouldn’t support Telcoin’s expansion."
We expect this issuance model to also help us reduce currency exchange spread costs, as we will
have ample liquidity at the primary entry and exit points for the currency (mobile money). Beyond
that, we will perform basic forex hedging to mitigate fiat currency exchange risk along the major
remittance corridors."

Challenges
Monetary Regulation
Community-based ventures are said to be disruptive. Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize
a number of traditional industries and as such, can be considered as a threat that needs to be
regulated by governments around the world. Law is generally lagging behind innovation, but it
often catches up, and global disruptors like Uber and Airbnb are now facing tough regulations
that impact their operations and have forced adaptation. On the other hand, regulatory barriers
can prove to be powerful assets for those who disrupt them at the right time.   "
We feel very strongly that Telcoin is coming at the right time, as on both the telecom and
cryptocurrency sides, we appear to be at a watershed moment for regulatory change. Of course
we are realistic about the fact that a number of countries are taking a harder stance on
cryptocurrencies, but we believe this to be a minority stance. We also believe that the majority of
governments that are currently banning cryptocurrencies will eventually allow them. We are simply
planning to prioritize our rollout schedule based on market factors including regulatory
environment."
The Telecom Side
It has been a rough first decade for mobile money. With a few prominent exceptions like
Safaricom in Kenya, most telecoms have faced an uphill battle with banking regulators. In a bid to
protect their national currencies and banks, central banks have made it very difficult for mobile
networks to introduce mobile money. They have forced telecoms to get banking licenses, and
have not made that easy. In many cases there have been concerted efforts by governments and
banking lobbies to stifle the spread of mobile money. As reported in Capco Institute’s Journal of
Financial Transformation, even current major players such as M-Pesa had to resist shutdown
attempts by local banking lobbies. 1 Banking lobbies naturally fear the loss of control over a 1
monopoly they've controlled for centuries, but they could count on the difficulty of obtaining a
banking license to slow the process down."
There is evidence, however, that a tidal shift is occurring. Mobile money ecosystem transactions
have quadrupled in the past four years. 12Furthermore, in markets where banks succeeded in
convincing government regulators that they are better equipped than telecoms to offer mobile
money - they have almost universally failed. The stark comparison between the success in
“telecom-led” mobile money in Kenya and the failure of “bank-led” mobile money in Nigeria is a
notable example. 1 Banks have had their chance, and there is a growing stable of evidence that 3

telecoms can be more successful than banks in deploying mobile money and improving financial
inclusion."
Telecom companies would not normally need banking licenses to simply make their network
available to approved bank services, but as they have become more involved in third party
payment processing, for instance, they have faced increased regulatory compliance pressure. As
Erwin A. Alampay from the University of the Philippines explains, companies like Vodafone and
Smart found ways around regulatory pressure. In a partnership with the Ahli United Bank of
Bahrain, they created a financial subsidiary to allow their customers to access remittance
services. 14But recently consumers have been demanding more, and governments have come
under increasing pressure to ease up regulations on telecom mobile money in the name of
financial inclusion."
As stated in the 2016 edition of the GSMA State of the Industry Report on Mobile Money, “The
majority of public and private sector stakeholders recognize that allowing non-banks, whether
retailers, mobile operators, or others, to issue mobile money is a necessary step toward greater
financial inclusion.” 1 According to the same report, now more than half of the countries with 5
mobile money services have an enabling regulatory approach. The GSMA defines an enabling
regulatory environment for mobile money as one where the following criteria are met: "
•  MNOs or their subsidiaries are able to obtain a license directly to offer electronic money; "
•  Prudential requirements are proportional to the risks presented by the mobile money business; "
•  Mobile money providers are able to offer their services using a network of third party agents; "
•  Know Your Customer requirements are tiered and risk-based to support the growth of low-value
accounts; "
•  Regulations allow for a market-led approach to interoperability.   "
The trend is clearly tilting toward more supportive regulation for mobile money and telecom-
provided financial services. "
Even Egypt, located in the strictly-regulated North African corridor, is benefiting from a fresh
perspective on mobile money regulation. The Egyptian central bank decided to loosen regulations
around mobile money late last year. 16It was pointed out in the statement released by the Central
Bank of Egypt that “mobile payment service is considered the most efficient financial services tool
to achieve financial inclusion proficiently, given the noticeably evident wide spread of mobile
phones nationwide.”17"

This trend of supportive regulations for mobile money creates a favorable environment for Telcoin,
particularly as this trend is coinciding with a similar easing trend towards cryptocurrencies."
The Cryptocurrency Side
Blockchain and cryptocurrencies face expected criticism as they intend to disrupt money itself. In
the past months, a few examples have showed us that governments around the world tend to be
protective, and even attempt to outright ban, the use of cryptocurrencies. The United Arab
Emirates central bank, for instance, issued a policy statement on January 1st containing a
statement: “D.7.3. Provisions for Virtual Currencies - All Virtual Currencies (and any transactions
thereof) are prohibited.”18"
The backlash was swift. After quickly realizing this new regulation would cut them out of an
emerging economy, the UAE backpedaled and on February 1st the governor of their central bank
issuing the following statement: “These regulations do not cover virtual currency [...] these
regulations do not apply to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, currency exchanges, or underlying
technology such as Blockchain.”"
                                                                                                             19                                                                                             20
Other countries like India                                                                                   , the USA                                                                                           , and South Africa1 2 are also making moves toward more
regulation for the cryptocurrency industry. South Africa’s example is particularly interesting. Its
Finance Minister Gigaba recently stated that the government wishes to develop a juridical
apparatus that “is supportive of the objectives of enhanced innovation, competition, and financial
inclusion in the financial sector, while also reviewing risks related to financial customer protection,
money laundering and financial stability.” It is part of a trend that tends to demonstrate a strong
will to not simply ban cryptocurrencies, but implement a set of laws that support financial
inclusion and the emergence of a new economy. Many countries are starting to understand the
potential size of a future blockchain economy and they feel the need to lay the first stones of its
framework. We see this environment as an opportunity to take part in the global regulatory
movement and help cryptocurrencies be seen as safe and trustworthy."
That said, there are obviously a number of large economies that currently ban cryptocurrencies,
including China, South Korea, Algeria and Tunisia. We feel that in the case of China and South
Korea, these bans are temporary efforts to quell scams and give regulators more time to formulate
regulatory regimes that will allow cryptocurrency based economy to flourish responsibly. This
opinion that the bans are temporary has even been openly expressed by government-affiliated
officials in countries that ban cryptocurrency. 22"

North Africa, as a satellite economic region very closely tied to the Euro-zone, presents a more
interesting situation in that currencies in these countries are genuinely at risk and require a careful
approach to cryptocurrency. On November 20th, Morocco banned cryptocurrencies outright,
claiming that cryptocurrencies operate within a “hidden payment system that is not backed by
any financial institution.” 2 While the Central Bank of Tunisia has not explicitly banned 3
cryptocurrency, capital controls restricting any output remittances make any sort of crypto-
exchange business untenable. As a result, Tunisians pay at least a 20% premium to acquire
Bitcoin. 24Telcoin is already in very constructive discussions with the Central Bank of Tunisia, and
is stressing the potential benefits that Telcoin can bring to central banks like the CBT. Telcoin
wallets are generally associated with mobile phone numbers and thus provide a simple country-
code based methodology for the application of central bank compliant categorization and
possibly smart contract automated taxation."
We feel that while monetary regulation is our greatest challenge, timing is optimal for Telcoin to
turn this barrier into an asset and capitalize on the concurrent trend looser regulation of both
mobile money and cryptocurrency. We also believe that we can constructively engage central
banks and operate in a compliant manner in the large majority of markets."
Mobile Network Security
Mobile networks are at the center of our business, so it is imperative that we design Telcoin in
order to manage their possible security challenges. Among the possible security challenges faced
by mobile networks, we consider attacks based on phone number re-routing such as “SIM-
jacking” to require the most attention."
The first predicate is that we can unfortunately not eradicate SIM-jacking in the current state of
affairs. Some of the more advanced networks have already started to move in the right direction
to protect their subscribers. Nevertheless, Telcoin is working under the assumption that we must
accept the reality of the SIM-jacking risk and build our security protocols around this assumption."
Telcoin works by exchanging tokens with users for mobile money, which is secured using SMS. In
additional to socially engineered SIM-jacking, SMS authentication is also vulnerable to being
compromised in wholesale transit or via SS7 attacks. So as explained in the Usage section above,
the default Telcoin security settings offered by fully compliant wallets will protect to the users
balance through a multi-signature wallet. Two of the three keys necessary to operate each wallet
will be held outside of the users control, one held by Telcoin and one held by the users mobile
operator. The one held by Telcoin will only be accessible using two factors of authentication, like a
password and TOTP (like the very usable Google Authenticator) or U2F (like Yubikey), but not
SMS. "
Therefore, in case of a compromised phone number or stolen device, only a small amount of their
balance could be taken out of their address prior to the complaint being processed. Any transfer

TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                   PAGE   3 OF 251




that exceeds a certain threshold amount determined by the mobile network would require a two-
factor authentication if the coins are stored using the default security settings. Thresholds will also
be placed on parameters such as total transaction volume over a given time span, protecting
against a large number of sub-threshold transactions. Once Telcoin or the mobile operator will
receive a complaint, the address will be immediately frozen until investigation, mitigating the
possible loss from SMS-based attacks."
In general, Telcoin will leverage existing telecom security protocols and build upon them to make
Telcoin as secure as possible without creating too much friction in the user experience."
Cryptocurrency Volatility
Volatility in the cryptocurrency space is another major concern for existing and potential users.
Many users purchasing Telcoin will actually invite the volatility, as they may be buying Telcoin for
speculative purposes. In the case of remittances, however, volatility is less likely to be seen as a
good thing. Some users may question the risk of losing large value while in transit as not being
worth saving a couple percent in fees."
First, we will feel obliged to fully inform users at the point of conversion as to the volatility risks
inherent in cryptocurrencies. Second, we would plan to offer basic risk mitigating financial
products as a one click offering for a small additional fee - namely, currency spot forward
contracts."
Currency forward contracts as a service
For a small fee, Telcoin will offer users the ability to lock in the current rate of a destination
currency for a fixed period of time - for example, one week. In this case the recipient would have
up to one week to convert Telcoin into their local currency at that fixed rate, regardless of any
fluctuations in the value of Telcoin. We would play the role of an intermediary entity through our
liquidity fund and guarantee a risk-free money transfer experience to Telcoin users."
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                   PAGE   3 OF 351




We obviously intend for this mechanism to be as smooth as possible in the wallets we are going
to release. We consider encapsulating complex financial operations into simple app functions
integral to our success."
From Telcoin to fiat currency in one click
Liquidity is also important to enabling users to be able to easily mitigate volatility risk to the extent
that they want to do so. By offering Telcoin issuance to partner mobile operators, and
incentivizing them to maintain a healthy level of liquidity reserve in both Telcoin and fiat currency,
we will ensure that users will always be able to instantly convert Telcoin to mobile money."
Through the wallet we will offer (or in cooperation with our partner telecom operators' wallets) we
plan to enable a simple Telcoin to fiat exchange function. We want to give to the consumer the
ability to turn Telcoin into local currency at any time. We want to do so in order to reduce volatility
risks for our users when they transfer Telcoin."
Software Security
Ethereum Blockchain
In the wake of the recent Ethereum attacks, we cannot possibly talk about Telcoin being secure
without addressing the state of this precise blockchain."
Here is a summary of the recent attacks that the Ethereum ecosystem has faced:"
• CoinDash had their website hacked. Hackers replaced the target address for ICO and hijacked the
equivalent of US$7M."
• Parity, an Ethereum wallet, got exploited by hackers. A Flaw in the smart contract gave hackers the
possibility of sending money to an arbitrary address, which they exploited to steal $32M."
• Bithumb, the largest South Korean cryptocurrency exchange, got hacked. An employees laptop
was compromised, resulting in US$1M stolen from users, and personal information leakage.
Most of those attacks do not directly result from issues with Ethereum itself, but from security
breaches of third parties, which is why we will appoint security experts and rely strictly on trusted
technology. During the ICO period, our website is going to be static and hosted on a provider that
allows secure 2-Factor authentication, which will inherently limit hacking risks. Moreover, we
designed following secure infrastructure principles such as separation of concerns (modular
architecture in which each module does only one thing) and the least privilege (modular
architecture in which each sub-part in the system only has access to the subset of data it needs)."
Following these principles, and other general security best practices, even if our staff gets their
SIM hijacked, their computer compromised, or their phone compromised, user data will
theoretically be unreachable. "
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                     PAGE   3 OF 451




Another issue that needs addressing when considering security, is the smart contract language
problem. Solidity, the language used to write smart contracts makes it notoriously difficult to
secure. The current solution is to rely on audited open source contracts available on Github. The
problem inevitably arises in the process of adapting these audited contracts to meet their desired
proprietary business logic. We plan to not only base our smart contracts on audited code, but to
also have our final contracts audited following the integration of business logic."
A paper written by Jack Pettersson and Robert Edström from Chalmers University of Technology
in 2016 makes a very interesting point about how much safer smart contracts would be if they
were written using languages implementing recent PL research. 25Telcoin commits to pursue
research in this area as we believe it will not only benefit us, but secure the entire Ethereum
economy. Researching security issues on the EVM is also part of the scope we intend to cover."
Wallet security
In order to store and spend cryptocurrencies, users normally use software wallets. Those wallets
typically hold keys that allow users to execute transactions on the blockchain. Traditionally, a user
can execute any sort of transaction on his addresses using their keys. As normal as it sounds, this
model exposes the user to the risk of losing all of their coins instantly if their private key is
compromised. On the Ethereum blockchain, those issues can be mitigated using smart contracts
acting like multi-signature wallets."
A multi-signature wallet, or multisig, requires a certain number of participants to sign for a certain
subset of operations to be executed. An example could be a wallet in which you would have daily
limits, and require several participants to sign in order to withdraw larger amounts."
We have partnered with multiple cryptocurrency wallet companies, which will allow us to provide
Telcoin users with the best experience of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Telcoin is planning to
25                                                                                                       https://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/234939/234939.pdf
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                                                                                            PAGE   3 OF 551




only work with wallet partners that support multi-signature wallets, which will benefit all of our
users instantly."
The intended security default for Telcoin is that users’ wallets are multisig with one key held by
their mobile operator, and another held by Telcoin. This mechanism would prevent loss of coins
due to SIM-jacking and stolen phones. This will be the default setting, which can be changed by
users if they intend to manage security themselves.
Hot and cold wallet strategy
The best accepted practice for storing any large amount of cryptocurrency is to use a strategy of
hot and cold wallets. Moving coins from a hot wallet to any colder wallet should be simple, but
moving coin out from a cold wallet must absolutely require more involved processes. Those
processes can include getting a keys from safes in remote locations, using specific cryptographic
hardware and even biometrics. "
As our issuance model will allow us to manage partner telecom wallets, it will inherently help us to
enforce a responsible hot and cold wallet strategy by default. Expertise from our wallet partners
has also been valuable in designing these processes."
Securing key management on devices
We want to provide the most secure and pleasant mobile experience to our users. An essential
part of this is to give users a way to encrypt their keys securely on their phones. We’re not the first
company trying to solve this problem, and recent phones provide secure encryption frameworks."
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                   PAGE   3 OF 651




Although we are not a wallet company, we intend to build a reference implementation to provide
mobile operators with white-labeled wallets or at the very minimum, guidance on how to build
their own wallets using our in-house experience. We will do everything in our power to ensure
every wallet accepting Telcoin is secure, as it is very important to generate much-needed trust.
The following methods are basic blocks we consider to be necessary to be compliant with our
security model."
• iOS - On iOS, the recommended way is to use Secure Enclave in wallets. This way, data is
directly encrypted using dedicated hardware (since iPhone 5S, all iPhones have encryption
built-in). When a user needs to access encrypted data to make a payment, they identify to
their Keychain using TouchID, which also makes use of hardware to decrypt the data if the
user is recognized. After this authentication step, the app will execute the transaction.
Every key stored on the device must be encrypted using this method."
• Android - Android in general tends to be much more fragmented than iOS, and this
fragmentation forces application developers to choose between reducing the security level
of their software and providing to a lower amount of users, as only a few devices
implement security primitives comparable with Apple’s TouchID. The most rational
approach in this case is to put a minimum of trust on the device by default, and design
applications in such a way that the device can be compromised without risking the user’s
balance. This essentially means not storing sensible data on the users phones."
Telecom Partnership Relationship
Telecom companies have a key role in our business model. Mobile networks will be the real node
between us (the original Telcoin issuing company) and Telcoin end users. Strong engagement with
telecom operators will result in potential mass adoption of Telcoin by consumers. However, if
telecoms for some reason would decide to stop cooperating with us, this could seriously impact
our business growth rate and endanger our company’s future."
Industry participation
In our experience, industry participation goes a long way in the telecom world. Telcoin is joining
the GSM Association and plans to actively participate in the GSMA Mobile Money Programme,
the forum dedicated to promoting the mobile money ecosystem and financial inclusion.   Our
involvement with the GSMA and other similar industry organizations will engender a positive
cooperative relationship with telecoms and mitigate the risk of losing the trust of mobile
operators."
Telcoin issuance incentive model
For any given mobile operator, the amount of free Telcoin it will receive each year will be based
primarily on their Telcoin transaction volume. The more Telcoin that a network exchanges with its
subscribers, the more Telcoin issuance it will receive. Doing so, we expect operators to promote
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                              PAGE   3 OF 751




Telcoin adoption as there will be a clear and direct link between their efforts and the financial
benefits they receive through the Telcoin issuance."
Regarding marketing, the issuance model as described above incentivizes telecoms to contribute
some of their Telcoin issuance value towards marketing Telcoin. In case a network fails to properly
market Telcoin, we will reserve the right to withhold up to ten percent of their issuance rights and
directly earmark it for Telcoin marking in their country."
Application support
From our experience, applications made by telecom operators are rarely adopted widely by
consumers. As a seamless experience for users is critical, we plan to help telecoms by partnering
with best-in-breed cryptocurrency wallets and also introduce a Telcoin reference wallet. We also
plan to support telecom operators who want to have their own in-house wallet by helping them
build the best wallet possible for their consumers. In case they already have a working product,
we are ready to help them improve their app design to maximize user experience. We want to take
an active part actively in any initiative that could boost Telcoin adoption."
Educating consumers
Marketing is usually a challenge for blockchain companies, because prior to advertising their
product, they first need to educate their potential users on blockchain technology and concepts.
Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are still things that are seen by masses as highly technical -
things that cannot be understood without a deep technological background. So the first challenge
for any company doing business on the blockchain is to make sure their potential users don’t feel
lost when they hear about how their product works. There is a common effort that needs to be
made within the industry and we are ready to participate in that effort. In parallel, as our target is
not the blockchain community but average mobile phone users (i.e. the general population), we
need to have marketing strategies that will appeal to them and inspire trust in our product. Here is
how we plan to address these challenges."
Blockchain needs to talk to the masses
As Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures observed, “the sector is full of technologists and mostly
empty of marketers.” 26This is a pretty accurate statement, and that is exactly why we have
included in our core team a seasoned B2C marketing specialist with Yacine Farouk. Founder of
Hype Means Nothing, he has coordinated marketing campaigns for major retail brands such as
Nike, Parrot, and the Jordan brand. We are confident his mastery of viral campaigns and B2C
marketing strategies will be of great help for Telcoin. On top of that, having family in Maghreb but
being born in France, Yacine has lived with remittance around him since he was a child, and is
very familiar with the challenges associated with remittances. This knowledge and experience will
turn into a valuable asset when we will need to address the remittance market. With the
blockchain industry being still relatively new, we don’t believe in those who sell themselves as
26                                                                                                       http://avc.com/2016/12/marketing-the-blockchain/
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                                                                     PAGE   3 OF 851




"blockchain marketing specialists." We do, however, believe in people who have experience
speaking to mass markets, and who understand the simple needs of everyday people."
Telcoin needs to inspire trust
We have a big advantage compared to other cryptocurrency companies - using telecoms as the
intermediary between us and the end users. Consumers will not need to trust us in order to start
using Telcoin, they will simply need to trust their telecom operator. In developed countries,
consumers might not fully trust telecoms to keep their data private - but at the very least, they
trust them for not offering illegal services or scam schemes. This is critical for Telcoin, as we will
be able to leverage telecom trust to satisfy these concerns that are commonly associated with
cryptocurrencies. Additionally we are actively cooperating with industry associations and non-
governmental organizations to promote and enable financial inclusion in developing countries. We
feel that this mission will grow over time and strengthen our reputation with users."
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                  PAGE   3 OF 951




Marketing
Telecom Channels
As described above in the Telcoin Issuance Model section, we will issue Telcoin to mobile
networks who will then sell Telcoin to their end users. As their cost for Telcoin will be zero, they
will enjoy 100% profit margin selling Telcoin to their subscribers. This of course will only last as
long as their issuance rights exceed demand for Telcoin on their network. The assumption then is
that for early adopting networks, this profit incentive for mobile networks will incentivize them to
cooperate in marketing Telcoin. "
For later adopting networks, the assumption is that by then there will be some built up brand and
existing demand in the market for Telcoin. At this point a mobile operator’s issuance rights will
probably no longer exceed Telcoin demand, but the networks will still be making a significant
profit by selling Telcoin to their subscribers."
Thus we see two marketing axes for Telcoin: "
• B2B marketing (targeting Telecom operators)"
• B2C marketing (targeting end users)"
In this section, we will review our plan for B2B marketing, and how we plan to have mobile
networks promote Telcoin use within their network."
Application development support
We are convinced that a flawless end-to-end user experience is critical to Telcoin success. While
we are in the business first and foremost of providing a cryptocurrency, we do also recognize the
need for attention to product. For this reason we plan to use an in-house product support team to
help operators with their existing wallet UX design or to help them build from scratch a wallet that
will be custom fit for Telcoin. We can count on our product director Naim Boughazi, who has led
product design at Tantan, one of the most popular social apps in China, to realize this work."
In-house marketing content for telecoms
Even if we give strong incentives to operators to market Telcoin, we understand that this may not
be enough. Marketing will be critical in our strategy and we can’t afford to rely completely on
mobile networks to market Telcoin. For this reason we plan to build an in-house marketing team
to market directly to consumers and to work with telecom marketing departments in cooperative
marketing efforts."
Turnkey marketing assets for operators
We will have a dedicated team producing marketing assets for our telecom partners:"
• Up-to-date press kits"
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                PAGE   4 OF 051




• Graphic banners"
• Video production"
• Miscellaneous visual assets"
We will also support telecoms in terms of advertising campaigns designed specifically for
individual markets or operators upon request. Our goal is to not only incentivize operators to
promote Telcoin, but to actively take part in quality assurance and overall marketing strategy."
Market identification and data analysis
We will help telecoms with both upstream and downstream data analysis. Upstream data analysis
will allow us to identify future Telcoin users and provide insight on how to reach them.
Downstream data analysis will then shed light on Telcoin-related ad campaign efficiency and help
us run effective PDCA cycles."
Marketing plan
In the targeting section, we have talked about which territories we plan to target. However for
each of these zones, we will need to think of specific marketing means and tools to reach out to
the population categories we need to speak to. Here is a brief summary of how we plan to
conduct this phase."
Western Europe & North America
In Europe & North America, we’ll focus marketing efforts on two population segments: foreign
workers coming from developing countries, and young educated urban users familiar with tech
and with potential for trend setting."
For the first category, we understand that each migrant group is different, reacts in different ways
and might not be receptive to the same marketing campaigns. However we believe there are
some common communication opportunities we can use here. In this particular case for instance,
we believe offline advertising in locations where people actually proceed with remittance
operations would be relevant and could help us reach out to various groups. One of the other
means we plan to use are focus groups. We want to leverage focus groups to trigger viral
marketing campaigns within foreign worker communities."
For young urban users, promotion will mostly happen online through tech and lifestyle blogs. We
also plan to integrate in our marketing mix YouTube influencers to have a less institutional image
and reduce the number of potential friction points. As a sub-category within the young urban
users, we plan to specifically target the children of second or third generation immigrants who
have become celebrities through cinema, music, and sport. People in this sub-category usually
also have an echo in their parents or grand-parents’ country of origin and thus have leverage we
can use on both sides of the remittance chain. They will be valuable spokespersons for Telcoin."
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                PAGE   4 OF 151




Asia
We are identifying two groups of countries in Asia: those who are on the sending side of
remittance corridors (like Japan and Korea), and those who are on the receiving end (like the
Philippines and Indonesia). For the first group of countries, our basic strategy will be similar to the
European one, particularly for young urban users. For immigrant populations, we are also
considering connecting with local influencers as well as doing online marketing on portals and
community sites. Offline promotion during community events is also something we plan to
integrate in our marketing strategy. A good example in Japan is the Cinco de Mayo festival for the
Latino community living here.27"
As for markets on the receiving end of remittances, we believe it will be more efficient to rely
heavily on telecom marketing while bringing them the support they need. In most developing
countries telecom companies are very powerful and are everywhere. They have partnerships with
leaders of various service and industry sectors and are a powerful vehicle for marketing
campaigns. We will also hire local marketing experts in countries where we see Telcoin use is
taking off in order to maximize our growth in these territories."
Africa and Middle East
Our strategy for most countries in Africa and the Middle East will be similar to our strategy in
countries on the receiving end of remittances in Southeast Asia. Operators in these countries are
very powerful and they will be crucial partners for us when it comes to marketing effort. In the
meantime we will also need to approach local entertainment industry influencers: musicians,
actors, and internationally known athletes."
There are also major originating points for remittances in the Gulf Cooperation countries of the
middle east, namely the United Arab Emirates, which originates a massive amount of remittance
to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Philippines and Egypt. Given the friendly stance of the UAE
government and mobile operators toward attracting blockchain investments and fintech, we are
considering the UAE to be a potential cornerstone project that could provide us powerful leverage
with mobile operators in all of the countries on the receiving end of remittances from the UAE."
Latin America and Caribbean
Latin America and Caribbean hold with North America a similar relationship to the one that exists
between Europe and Africa for instance. Therefore, our strategy for these territories will be similar
to the one we will need to adopt to work on Europe to Africa remittance corridors. Additionally,
Caribbean communities also a strong presence in Europe, so we will need to keep this channel in
mind when we plan our campaigns."
Given recent hurricanes in the Caribbean, we are planning to use the disaster relief use case in
marketing efforts with mobile network operators in the region.

Company Structure and Budget
Telcoin Pte Ltd is an existing Singapore private limited company. The Telcoin Foundation is a
planned non-profit entity that will be established in a yet to be determined jurisdiction. As for now
the majority of our team members are operating from Japan for an obvious reason: Japan has a
large pool of skilled engineers, less competition for top talent, a high quality of life, and a flexible
immigration policy compared to places like Silicon Valley or western Europe. Additionally, Japan
was among the first countries to provide a regulatory framework favorable to blockchain based
28  29
initiatives allowing several major retail outlets like Bic Camera to accept payments in Bitcoin
This is a positive sign for any company providing a product related to cryptocurrencies."
We are not only a currency, we are also a company, and we intend to be very transparent and
open about many things, financials included. We believe it to be very important that our business
case is strong for the currency we put on the market to be a solid asset, which is why we are
going to provide a high level overview of how we realistically intend to build this company. "
We plan to structure the company around the concept of autonomous teams, to limit
management overhead that is to be expected in any large organization. Our experience showed
us that flatter structures help with information flow, and in such a fast moving environment we
need a structure that allows us to act and react as fast as possible."
Technology Team
DevOps
We will operate a network of services to maintain our systems, and therefore will need proper
DevOps. Our philosophy when it comes to DevOps is more about building tools and designing for
fault tolerance than only operating servers, which is why we'll focus on hiring DevOps that can
actually program."
We will strive to write our tooling using Rust."
The target size of this team is 3 to 5 remote and distributed engineers."
Crypto Development
Smart contracts are hard, and hoping one can get everything right at once is not realistic. We will
dedicate proper resources to maintain and extend our smart contracts, and work on new ones as
the company grows. Those developers will write Solidity code at first but we will research better
languages."

The target size of this team is 2 software engineers."
Cryptocurrency Research
The current state of programming on the blockchain is very primitive, and in order to stabilize our
business and the entire ecosystem, some research must be conducted. A recent master thesis by
Jack Pettersson and Robert Edström illustrates that a lot of potential exists to improve not only on
the Ethereum ecosystem, but the entire cryptocurrency landscape by using sound programming
technologies like proper type systems to strengthen smart contracts.30"
Solidity has helped get Ethereum to where it is, but we will hire PL researchers to implement safer
languages on the EVM and prevent this type of fiasco from happening again."
Languages is not the only area we plan to research, but it will be the primary one for the first 18
months of the company."
We intend for this team to be 2 to 3 researchers."
Telecom Development
As compliance is a major challenge, we plan to offer various compliance products for telecoms to
use, in the area of anti-money laundering and fraud management.   As our team has years of
experience developing telecom software, we feel this task is manageable for our team, and are
confident in our ability to hire top talent for this. We are developing all of our tools in Rust."
As mobile networks are diverse in technology and vendors, this team will have a lot of work and
we will grow it to 5 people before the end of 2018."
Customer Facing Products
In order to help our Telecom partners to reach their customers with Telcoin, we will provide them
with wallets that they can brand properly and integrate with their existing mobile money solutions."
This said, we do not intend to place ourselves as a wallet company. Telcoin is wallet agnostic and
the wallets will be here to help the growth of the company by providing reference
implementations. We will also partner with multiple cryptocurrency wallet companies to provide
our users with the best wallet options on the market from Day 1."
The head of this team, Naïm Boughazi is already with us. We also already have a senior iOS
developers with 5 years of experience with customer facing apps. This team will add UX
designers, 1 Javascript developer and an Android developer before the end of 2018."

Business Team
Customer Service
A product facing company in the financial world needs first class customer service. For this
reason, we will have an in-house team to serve the needs of our customers."
Not only we will need to manage services mobile operators, but we'll also provide substantial help
to their customers, as the quality of their experience will be a determining factor in our success."
Even though we want to enhance our customers service using AI and chatbots, we assume we
will need an average of at least three full time support staff per continent before the end of 2018.
We also intend to provide training to the customer service department of our telecom partners so
they can better assist their customers."
Legal and Compliance
As described in our Challenges section, we expect regulations to bring us a lot of work. Hiring a
strong legal team is on the roadmap. At the minimum, we are looking at:"
• A Lobbying specialist."
• A Compliance officer."
• A Telecom regulations expert."
Finance and Liquidity
In order to manage money flows over the world, we will build a team using the knowledge of our
money flow expert advisor, Chris Suh, who spent ten years in treasury management at Goldman
Sachs."
The main drivers for the finance team to grow will be the number of jurisdictions we operate in
and the risks we are trying to cover. This said, we're going to start with a compliance officer, a risk
officer, and a risk analyst. Because of the nature of our business, compliance will be a transversal
team, working with product, legal, and business development. "
Business Development
Our biz dev team will consist of two separate units - sales and compliance."
• Sales team to manage relationships with mobile network operators"
• Compliance team to manage relationships with government regulators"
Communication with mobile operators and regulators is key for Telcoin, and we’re going to build a
solid pair of teams to handle sales. The reason for this split is very simple. We need to build
TELCOIN WHITEPAPER V1.3                                                                                   PAGE   4 OF 551




relationships with telecoms, but also need to work with regulators to enable full adoption by
networks and also to be fully compliant in respective markets."
The structure will therefore be:"
Sales team, including a leader and 4 to 5 regional sales managers. In addition to those regional
managers, we’ll have local representatives and consultants with more experience on the ground
with individual networks."
Compliance team will be structured vertically instead of regionally. Whereas the sales team will be
organized geographically, the compliance team will be composed of subject matter experts
focused on the various aspects of regulation and compliance."
Account Management
In addition to the business development teams, we’ll have internal account managers for day-to-
day relationship management and support. The core of our business is to partner with telecoms in
order to together follow the gradual process of regulatory approval, delivery and marketing. This
means not only closing partnership deals with mobile operators, but also maintaining long-term
relationships with professional support."
Marketing
We consider marketing to be essential to our business. We are targeting people that never used
cryptocurrencies before, and that means solving issues of PR, trust, and fear of uncertainty in the
market. Those are challenges that no blockchain company cracked before, and even though it will
likely be a joint effort, we need to work hard to reach our market."
Our marketing team will operate on two levels and will therefore be split in two. One team will
assist mobile operators so they can promote Telcoin to their users and potential customers, while
another team will build brand affinity directly with consumers."

Initial Coin Offering                                                                                   *NOTE ICO TOKEN SALE IS NOW FINISHED****
Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are an exciting new way for companies to raise funds, particularly used
in the blockchain space.   Most ICOs today involve a token sale that grants specifically defined
rights, for example a revenue share vehicle. These ICOs have legal complexities, particularly in
terms of securities compliance.   Telcoin has an advantage in that our ICO will actually be selling
the same cryptocurrency that we will be marketing. Furthermore, being based in Japan and
established in Singapore, we benefit from a legal environment greatly favorable to token sales.
There has been a solid interest around cryptocurrencies for years in Japan, but the number of
Japan-based companies doing ICOs here is surprisingly low. We want to tap into this interest in
cryptocurrency and participate responsibly in the ecosystem in order to build a successful
example for other to follow. "
We plan to lead our fundraising activity according to the following 3 phases, and we will explain
how it will unfold for each of them below:"
• Pre-ICO"
• ICO period"
• Post-ICO"
Pre-ICO Phase
Before we open the Telcoin purchase to the public through the actual ICO, we plan to meet with
potential contributors who intend to purchase a minimum of US$100,000 worth of Telcoin. We
also plan to allocate a small portion of the Telcoin to reward those who have committed at a very
early stage or high contribution level. (See ICO breakdown below for further details)."
ICO Phase
The Telcoin supply will be composed of 100,000,000,000 coins, but only 25% of the total supply
will be distributed during the ICO. This 25% will be distributed to our ICO contributors through the
general crowd sale as described in the Telcoin ICO website (www.telco.in/ico), and bonuses
allocated to contributors coming in with a big amount will be taken from this pool as well."
The unit value of a coin will be calculated based on the total amount of funds raised during the
pre-ICO and ICO phases. As this total amount will stand for 25 percent of the coins in circulation,
unit price will be calculated as:"
Telcoin unit price = (Total funds raised / 25%) / 100,000,000,000"
Telcoin will be purchasable in exchange for Ethereum, through our smart contract for a limited
time and limited amount, or using Bitcoin or fiat currency. Our coin will be on sale for a maximum

of two months and we plan to only accept contributions up to the equivalent of US$25,000,000.
Once either of these two limits is reached, we plan to close our ICO phase."
Post-ICO Planning
We have developed an operational budget of roughly US$25,000,000 to kickstart Telcoin during
the first 36 months, but if we were to raise more funds, we already have thought of several ways
to allocate them efficiently:"
• A large part of the extra funds will be allocated to additional marketing spending in order to
maximize our reach to at least one telecom in as many countries as possible - particularly important
remittance corridors.   "
• In a number of markets we expect to need a formidable effort to overcome regulatory challenges,
and extra funds will help us to build a strong lobby team with the necessary resources and top
notch respected legal support."
• In the mid to long term, extra funds will help us to operate strategic M&A when we will have a need
for it, for example to acquire our way into a strategic market or engage in strategic joint ventures
with large telecom groups."
• In general, a larger ICO raise will help us gain leverage in negotiations with telecom operators. We
feel that a collective coordinated global effort to lobby telecoms and regulators will be required, and
this will be expensive."
• In our long term strategy, we don’t close the door to becoming a MVNO in some countries if it
makes sense for our growth strategy."
• After the ICO is over and once we have kickstarted our activity, we can also consider private equity
investment through a series A round if it makes sense regarding our financing plan."
