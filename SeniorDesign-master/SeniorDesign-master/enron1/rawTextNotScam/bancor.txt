Abstract
The Bancor Protocol enables automatic price determina-
tion and an autonomous liquidity mechanism for tokens
on smart contract blockchains. These Smart Tokens have
one or more connectors to a network that hold balances
of other tokens, allowing users to instantly purchase or
liquidate a Smart Token for any of its connected tokens
directly through the Smart Token’s contract, at a price
that is continuously recalculated to balance buy and sell
volumes.
The Bancor Protocol is named in honor of the Keynesian proposal to systematize interna-
tional currency conversion by introducing a supranational reserve currency called Bancor
(Bretton Woods Conference, 1944).

1  Introduction
1.1  Background
We live in a world where anyone can publish an article, create a discussion group, or run
an online marketplace.  Low barriers to entry have allowed user-generated content and
peer participation to emerge as defining characteristics of the Internet era.  We are now
witnessing the emergence of user-generated digital assets.  For centuries, humans have
issued and circulated tokens of value in the form of banknotes, bonds, equity, gift cards,
loyalty points, community currencies and more. In 2009, Bitcoin [1] introduced the idea of
a decentralized digital currency based on cryptographic consensus, and in its wake followed
a wave of new digital assets, cryptocurrencies, colloquially referred to as tokens.
Tokens can be used to manage access to services, as proof of contribution in crowdfunded
projects, as incentives in decentralized applications, as IOUs, as local currencies, as proof
of ownership of real-world assets, and more. They are often issued in crowdsales known as
Token Generation Events (TGEs) orchestrated through smart contracts. A smart contract
is a simple software program that, once committed to a blockchain, is guaranteed to run
unchanged for as long as the underlying blockchain remains operational. Smart contracts
have many of the same capabilities as regular blockchain users, i.e., they can invoke other
smart contracts and hold balances of tokens in escrow. A well-defined smart contract can
be viewed as a reliable, incorruptible, and fully automated middleman. This makes smart
contracts uniquely suited to the mechanical yet sensitive task of managing the issuance
and governance of tokens.
1.2  Internet of Value & Liquidity
Despite differing uses and characteristics,  all tokens abstractly represent some kind of
economic value. Owners from all parts of the world exchange tokens as part of their daily
business, giving rise to a global Internet of value.  Currently, the links connecting this
Internet are traders buying and selling tokens from each other, either directly or through
third-party services such as exchanges.
Unlike, for instance, the cables between Internet switches, which are perpetually available
to transfer any data coming through them, these trade links are ephemeral, meaning there
must be a buyer and a seller available (digitally) at the same time and on the same venue
in order for the tokens to pass through the network.   The challenge with consistently
finding a match between buyers and sellers is a problem known in economics as double
coincidence of wants  [2].  In order for a token to effectively partake in the global token
economy (i.e., the Internet of value), its trading volume must cross a critical barrier where
these matches between buyers and sellers become frequent enough to be reliable.  This
reliability of exchange is known as liquidity. We say a token is liquid if it is easily possible
3




to buy or sell it without considerably affecting its price. While liquidity is not a problem
for the most widely used tokens, it is a significant impediment to buying and selling small-
scale tokens (such as tokens required to use a niche decentralized application or to enable
commerce in a small local community) or new tokens that still have low adoption.
Much the same as certain populations of people cannot access the Internet because they
live in remote locations where connectivity is not yet economic for “link” providers, large
numbers of token owners  (and potential token creators) cannot partake in the Internet
of value because they own illiquid tokens without enough  “links” to the greater token
economy to be considered liquid and thus reliably usable. In traditional financial markets,
market makers solve this liquidity problem by always offering to both buy or sell a financial
asset, even when there is low interest in the asset on the market. These are typically large
financial institutions that leverage their significant reserves of capital to generate profit
on market illiquidity and can tolerate significant illiquidity risk.  They profit by quoting
different prices to buyers and sellers, earning the difference  (known as the spread) over
time.
In the realm of blockchain, the utilization of traditional market makers to solve the liquidity
problem would not only violate the movement’s spirit of cutting out middlemen, it would
also constitute significant centralization of financial power within the major holders of
capital in the new token economy.
1.3  Long Tail Phenomenon
Today, the top 10% of tokens make up 95% of the entire token market cap and represent
99% of all trading volume (based on analysis of over 1000 tokens listed on CoinMarketCap).
The tail end (i.e., the remaining 90%) of tokens is practically insignificant. This stands in
sharp contrast to many other online ecosystems where the tail end cumulatively makes up
a significant part of total volume, an observation known as the long tail phenomenon [3].
For example, books with too little volume to be carried by regular bookstores make up an
estimated 30-40% of the titles sold on Amazon [4]. The forming of a long tail begins once
the barriers to its existence are removed.  YouTube made it simple to upload and view
videos. Blogging platforms made it easy for people to publish their content. A simple path
to creating a liquid token is the barrier to the emergence of a long tail of user-generated
currencies.
1.4  Bancor Liquidity Network
In this white paper, we propose the Bancor Network for decentralized liquidity, based on
the Bancor Protocol, which leverages the capabilities of smart contracts to build liquidity
directly into tokens themselves.  Such tokens, which we call Smart Tokens™, are always
available to be both bought and sold directly through their smart contracts. In other words,
4




the token’s governing software always offers to sell tokens to buyers and buy back tokens
from sellers.  Each Smart Token has one or more connectors that link the Smart Token
to other tokens in the network.  These connectors hold a balance of another token, thus
establishing a relationship between the Smart Token and the tokens held by its connectors,
or its connected tokens. Smart Token connectors employ a formula (elaborated below) to
establish a price relationship between a Smart Token and its connected tokens. Connector
balances are used to provide liquidity for the Smart Token and any of its connected tokens,
at these algorithmic prices.
All Smart Tokens are ERC20-compatible tokens, meaning they function as and are com-
patible with any system or service which supports these now-standard Ethereum-based
tokens.  The result of the Smart Token standard is an Internet of value that is continu-
ously connected because every token autonomously maintains a liquid link to the rest of
the token economy. By presenting a modern, efficient and automated solution to illiquid-
ity, we believe the Bancor Protocol can become an enabling technology for a long tail of
user-generated tokens, thus paving the way for a diverse economy of millions of small-scale,
user-generated currencies.  This multi-currency paradigm is both scalable and decentral-
ized.
2  Smart Tokens
2.1  Non-Profit Automated Market Makers
Smart Tokens are the heart of the Bancor Protocol.  They operate as regular tokens, in
compliance with the ERC20 token standard [5] used on the Ethereum blockchain [6], but
include additional logic that allows users to always buy and sell them directly through their
own smart contracts at prices that programmatically adjust to reflect supply and demand.
Effectively, Smart Tokens come with a built-in liquidity mechanism that ensures they are
continuously convertible for other tokens.
To achieve this, each Smart Token is configured with connector modules, which hold a
balance of another token to which it is connected  (for example, the BNT Smart Token
has a single connector to ETH, which holds a balance in ETH). Buyers can use any of
the connected tokens to purchase a Smart Token by sending them to the Smart Token’s
contract, which then adds them to its connector balance and in return issues new Smart
Tokens, which are automatically sent back to the buyer. In other words, anyone can always
purchase a Smart Token by depositing some amount of its connected token into its smart
contract.  In this case, both the connector balance of the Smart Token has increased, as
has the Smart Token’s supply, since new units were issued.  Similarly, a seller may send
back any amount of Smart Tokens to its contract, which will then remove these Smart
Tokens from circulation and withdraw a corresponding amount of connected tokens from
the connector balance and send them to the seller. In this case, both the connector balance
5




and the Smart Token’s supply have decreased. In order to know what amount to issue to a
buyer or withdraw for a seller, a Smart Token continuously recalculates its price vis-à-vis
each of its connected tokens, in relation to the supply of and demand for the Smart Token.
The Bancor Formula (elaborated below) does so by maintaining a fixed ratio (referred to
as weight, discussed below) between the value of the Smart Token and the value of its
connector balance(s). The adaptive supply of a Smart Token (recall that it is newly issued
when purchased and removed from circulation when sold) is a unique and enabling feature
which allows for supply to adjust to demand (without dilution to unit price) and for Smart
Tokens to be continuously available for purchase. In the future, the Bancor Protocol will
also standardize Smart Token configurations with traditional fixed supplies.
While it may sound precarious to allow a token to issue and remove itself (expanding and
contracting its own supply), the software logic for doing so runs in a transparent (publicly
viewable) smart contract on an immutable (unchangeable) blockchain. Furthermore, Smart
Token supply programmatically increases only when the connected token balance increases
in any of its connectors (via a purchase), ensuring that Smart Tokens will always be linked
to some proportionate value of another token, preventing unanticipated inflation.
Currently, a Smart Token can be connected to any ERC20-compliant token by holding a
balance of this ERC20 token in its connector, through its smart contract. This makes the
Bancor Protocol backwards-compatible with a large part of existing tokens today.  In the
future, support is planned for Smart Tokens to connect to tokens across various blockchains.
In effect, Smart Tokens function as completely automated and decentralized market makers
that, by operating in a network architecture on a blockchain, can function as effective
and autonomous convertibility conduits, without relying on the existing labor-based (i.e.,
manual) trade approach and accompanying profit-seeking motive.
2.2  Connector Weight
As mentioned above,  the connector  weight  represents a fixed ratio between the Smart
Token’s total value (its supply × its unit price) and the value of its connector balance. The
creator of a Smart Token defines this desired ratio for each connector.  This ratio will be
held constant by the Bancor Formula as both the connector balances and the Smart Token’s
total value (sometimes referred to as “market cap”) fluctuate with buys and sells.  Since
each purchase or sale of a Smart Token triggers an addition or subtraction of connected
tokens and Smart Tokens, the price of the Smart Token vis-á-vis its connected tokens
will continuously recalculate to maintain the constant connector weight, i.e., the creator’s
configured ratio between them. This ratio determines how sharply a Smart Token’s price
needs to adjust in order to be maintained with every transaction, or in other words, its
price sensitivity. A higher ratio between the connector balance and the Smart Token will
result in lower price sensitivity, meaning that each buy and sell will have a relatively softer
effect on the Smart Token’s price movement. A lower ratio between the connector balance
6




and the Smart Token will result in higher price sensitivity, meaning that each buy and
sell will have a relatively stronger effect on the Smart Token’s price movement. It can be
said that a higher weight leads to relative price stability of a Smart Token vis-à-vis its
connected token, and a lower weight leads to relative price volatility of the Smart Token
vis-á-vis its connected token.  Section 3 elaborates further on the pricing algorithm and
selecting connector weights based on the desired nature of the Smart Token.
Smart Token connectors can be viewed as decentralized, autonomous, transparent and
predictable market makers, rather than exchanges. Smart Tokens manage their connector
balances by programmatically adjusting their prices to maintain a constant ratio between
them and the Smart Token’s total token value.  Since their logic is transparent and im-
mutable, it is always possible to predict how a purchase or sale of a Smart Token will move
its price, which ultimately leads to more stable token prices.  This formulaic mechanism
makes Smart Tokens reliable mediators of supply and demand.
2.3  Networks of Tokens
Smart Tokens allow for instant conversion between themselves and any of their connected
tokens. This functionality is sufficient for a Smart Token to also become instantly convert-
ible to any number of other tokens which connect to the same network in a similar fashion.
In other words, a Smart Token is instantly convertible to any of its connected tokens, and
also to any of its connected tokens’ connected tokens, and so on, via the network.
Suppose for instance that a Smart Token, ABCCoin, has a connector holding a balance
of XYZCoin.  Furthermore, suppose a different Smart Token, NEWCoin, also has a connec-
tor which holds a balance of XYZCoin.  Then a user will be able to convert ABCCoin to
NEWCoin simply by first converting ABCCoin into XYZCoin, and then converting XYZCoin
into NEWCoin. This can happen seamlessly in the background with only one action required
by the user.
Furthermore, NEWCoin might itself be connected to additional tokens, expanding the con-
nection range. In this way, Smart Tokens can transitively connect to an unlimited number
of tokens, creating a decentralized liquidity network capable of connecting an Internet of
value consisting of potentially millions of tokens, all autonomously convertible for each
other, at continuously calculated rates.

3  Pricing Algorithm
3.1  Price Formula
The Bancor Formula for algorithmic pricing is central to the system’s design and potential
because it enables Smart Tokens to consistently determine their own reliable and pre-
dictable prices, which is ultimately essential for mass adoption of usable tokens. It is built
on the idea, introduced in the previous section, that each Smart Token maintains a ratio
between its total value (total supply × unit price) and its connector balance. We call this
ratio the connector weight, or CW for short.
CW =      connector balance
Smart Token’s total value
The Smart Token’s total value, i.e., its market cap, is the amount of money one would get
by selling every token (the entire Smart Token supply) at its current price.  The price of
a Smart Token is denominated in the connected token (for example, the price of BNT is
denominated in ETH, its connected token).
Smart Token’s total value = price × Smart Token supply
These relationships are the keys to Bancor’s pricing algorithm because they allow the
system to algebraically solve for each Smart Token’s price as a function of its CW, the
connector balance, and the Smart Token’s outstanding supply.
connector balance
price =
Smart Token’s outstanding supply × CW
At any given time, each connector always has an accurate and irrefutable record of the size
of its balance and the current number of Smart Tokens in supply, so that it only needs to
know the CW in order to continuously calculate the correct price for a Smart Token while
both its connector balance is changing  (with buys and sells as well as connected token
price movement) and its supply is changing (with buys and sells, which occur by sending
to or withdrawing from the connector balance).  The CW  is expressed as a percentage
greater than 0% and up to 100%, and as mentioned, is initially set by the creator when a
Smart Token is configured.  The value chosen for the CW has significant implications for
the pricing of the token, and may also be changed, depending on the Smart Token’s chosen
settings.

Figure 1: Shows quoted price as a function of Smart Token supply for varying CWs. The
charts have been rendered with an initial price of 1 and an initial supply of 1000
Smart Tokens, however, as the CW  alone defines the price elasticity, curves
would develop similarly for any initial supply and price, albeit with different
values on the axes.
3.2  Supply and Demand with Different Connector Weights
Figure 1 shows how the price of a Smart Token reacts to changes in demand for different
values of the CW . Let us briefly discuss the illustrated cases:
(a)  The first case is CW  =  100% where the Smart Token’s price can never change in
9




relation to its connected token balance or supply, but rather tracks it completely,
regardless of demand. The price is effectively pegged to its connected token balance(s)
and the Smart Token becomes a proxy for that value. This can be likened to the gold
standard, a monetary scheme where an issuing body commits to always exchange a
currency for a certain amount of gold.  For example, the US dollar was pegged to
gold at a rate of $35 per ounce until 1971.
(b)                                                                                            A second linear case is CW = 50% where the Smart Token price moves linearly with
the supply (which is growing or shrinking with the connector balance).  The Smart
Token price decreases when demand for it is low (i.e., when greater volumes are sold
than bought) and increases when demand for it is high (i.e., when greater volumes
are bought than sold). This relationship is how supply and demand typically work,
with the exception that a Smart Token’s supply is not fixed, but dictated by demand,
and yet also not dilutive to the unit price when it increases.
(c)                                                                                            A third and non-linear case is CW  between  0% and  50%, which shows a similar
growth relationship between price and supply, but sees the price curve grow more
aggressively with increasing supply.  The chart shows the particular price curve for
CW  =  10%.  A CW lower than 10% would react even more aggressively (sharper
exponential curve) than this, and a CW  higher than 10% would relatively flatten
towards the linear (b) shape as it approaches 50%.
(d)                                                                                            The final also non-linear case is CW between  50% and  100%,  where the growth
relationship between price and supply sees the price curve grow less aggressively
than (b), meaning the Smart Token’s price reacts less and less to changes in supply,
until reaching the flat 100% relationship we see in (a).  The particular chart shows
the price curve for CW = 90%.
Theoretically, it is also possible for a Smart Token to have a CW that is greater than 100%,
however, this is a specific case where the token becomes cheaper as demand increases, and
is outside the scope of this discussion.
3.3  Handling Price Slippage
Above we develop the equation for determining the price of a Smart Token at any given
point in time. But as the charts show, when buying or selling Smart Tokens (thus increasing
or decreasing their supply), their price moves! In fact, even the tiniest transaction moves
the price of a Smart Token to a new level, meaning that a buyer will get a different price
if she splits her order into many small transactions.  To address this, when needing to
calculate an actual conversion price, we look at the total amount of tokens a Smart Token
must return to the buyer  (in new Smart Tokens issued) or seller  (in connected tokens
withdrawn from the connector balance) for a given amount of tokens received (of either
the connected token from a buyer, or the Smart Token from a seller).

                                                                                                (                           )CW
tokens issued = supply ×                                                                        1 + connected tokens paid   − 1
balance
The equation was derived by viewing a transaction as the result of many infinitely small
transactions that each impact the Smart Token’s supply and the connector balance, thus
leading to a new price for each subsequent increment. The actual price for a given trans-
action size is the final price after each infinitely small increment of the transaction size
has had its relative impact on the price.  A formal mathematical proof is available here.
The equations are similar for both buy and sell orders, where we derive the actual amount
of the Smart Token units to issue (to a buyer) or connected tokens to withdraw from the
connector balance (for a seller) for a given amount of tokens received by the Smart Token
contract.
(                                                                                               √                                  )
                                                                                                (                           )

supply
We are now able to calculate the effective price of a transaction by considering the amount
of Smart Tokens converted per connected token, i.e., the price of a Smart Token in terms
of its connected token. This effective price will be different for each transaction size, and
vis-á-vis each connector in the case of more than one.
effective price = connected tokens exchanged
smart tokens exchanged
The effective price has the desired property of ten small transactions or one large transac-
tion of the same cumulative amount leading to exactly the same cost.
3.4  Pricing Example
As an example, we take a Smart Token that currently has a supply of 1000 tokens, with
a connector that currently holds a balance of 250 of the connected tokens, and a CW of
50%. This Smart Token can be converted into its connected token at the following price:
250
price =
1000 × 50% = 0.5
Suppose a buyer wants to convert 10 units of the connected token into Smart Tokens. How
many Smart Tokens will she receive?
                                                                                                (                           )
                                                                                                (                           )50%
tokens issued = 1000 ×                                                                          1 +  10                     − 1    ≈ 19.8
                                                                                                250
                                                                                                11




Considering the amount of Smart Tokens issued, we can now derive the effective price when
converting 10 units of the connected token into the Smart Token:
10
effective price =
19.8 ≈ 0.5051
Note how the effective price is different from the quoted price, in this case slightly higher.
The difference is due to the price slippage for this particular transaction size explained in
the previous section. In other words, each infinitely small incremental unit of the 10 tokens
converted lead to upward pressure on the price, by adding to the connector balance and
to the Smart Token supply. Effectively the buyer has paid for the price slippage caused by
her own transaction. The buyer is able to perform these calculations in advance of sending
her tokens to the smart contract, allowing her to accurately gauge how the price will move
in response to her conversion. The predictability and uniformity of the price slippage is a
key benefit of the Bancor formula.
3.5  Asynchronous Liquidity
As a Smart Token processes conversions, the price will converge toward an equilibrium
between buy and sell volumes.  For this to happen in a classic exchange model where
buyers and sellers are matched to each other, there must be sufficient liquidity for two
orders to be reliably matched at any time.   This is not a requirement of the Bancor
Protocol because Smart Tokens always process buys and sells immediately by converting
them via their connector balances, and therefore calculate prices continuously over time.
Whereas prices are traditionally calculated for each trade independently (when a buyer and
seller are matched), each conversion of a Smart Token progressively and directly impacts
its price. This makes Bancor’s price-determination mechanism truly asynchronous.
3.6  Balanced Prices through Arbitrage
Smart Tokens may also be traded on various exchanges, where their market price could
potentially diverge from the price quoted by the Smart Token. Since Smart Tokens do not
have functionality for observing prices in the external world, it appears that there is risk
of the Smart Token’s price fragmenting.  However, such a situation is unlikely to last for
long because it constitutes a clear arbitrage opportunity. For example, if the market price
moves higher than the price quoted by the Smart Token, anyone could buy from the Smart
Token and sell on the market until prices even out.  The ability to arbitrage effectively
incentivizes market participants to create price consensus between the Smart Token and
external prices.
It is also worth noting that the Smart Token functionality of issuing new units and in-
creasing supply (when connected tokens are added to the connector balance) exists only
12




when interacting with the Smart Token directly. Smart Tokens listed, bought and sold on
external exchanges, or moved directly between people, do not trigger this functionality,
but rather circulate existing supply.  Nevertheless, the prices at which existing supply is
offered will have an effect on the prices of Smart Tokens as quoted by the Smart Token
contract via the arbitrage mechanism outlined above.
4  Advantages of Smart Tokens
Smart Tokens are a new paradigm in token markets because they incorporate automated
and decentralized agents that tirelessly fill conversion orders at prices that reflect math-
ematical supply and demand,  and which adapt to conversion sizes in real time.   This
introduces multiple advantages over traditional exchange-based trading:
Continuous liquidity  Users can always buy or sell tokens in the network directly through
their smart contracts, even when there are only few or no other buyers or sellers
in the market.  Because prices adjust to conversion size, there is always some price
at which a token may be converted.  The Bancor Protocol effectively disconnects
liquidity from trade volume.
No built-in fees  By default, Smart Tokens do not apply fees to the conversions they ex-
ecute.  The only fees incurred by users are those required to transact with the un-
derlying blockchain (e.g., gas on Ethereum).  While Smart Token creators may set
an optional usage charge (called a contribution) for conversion via their particular
Smart Token, these will likely be very low as the open source nature of the protocol
would allow another user to easily create a competing Smart Token offering a similar
conversion ability for less. The Bancor Protocol does not require conversion fees for
operating profit, but rather benefits from increased adoption as the network of tokens
expands and the number of users grows.
Adjustable price sensitivity  The leverage provided by a substantial connector balance and
high weight makes the price of that particular Smart Token less sensitive to short-
term speculation or sudden turbulence caused by large orders. For example, a Smart
Token with a 10% CW is comparable to an exchange having an order book equal in
value to 10% of the token’s entire market cap.  This sensitivity can be adjusted via
the CW and connector balance to achieve the desired profile of a given Smart Token.
No spread  The Bancor Formula applies the same price calculation when handling both
buy and sell orders. This contrasts with traditional exchanges where the buy price is
always lower than the sell price.  The difference between the buy and the sell price,
known as the spread, is what allows traditional market makers to earn a profit.  As
mentioned above, the Bancor Protocol does not require this profit in order to operate,
and decentralized spreads may be introduced in order to encourage adoption of the
network, benefiting all participants.
13




Predictable prices  A Smart Token’s price algorithm is completely transparent, allowing
users to pre-calculate the effective price of their desired conversion before executing
a conversion.  This contrasts with traditional order-book based exchanges where a
large order can cause a price to unpredictably slip to a significantly different level.
Based on ERC20  Smart Tokens are ERC20-compliant tokens (albeit with additional func-
tionality) that seamlessly integrate with existing token applications (such as wallets
or Dapps) because they comply with the popular ERC20 token standard.  Further,
any existing ERC20 standard token can connect to the Bancor Network via a Smart
Token with two connectors, making the Bancor Protocol backwards compatible with
existing ERC20 tokens. We elaborate on a variety of Smart Token configurations in
section 6 below.
5  Smart Token Use Cases and Implications
We believe the unique properties of the Bancor Protocol make it attractive for a variety
of use cases, which range from providing more reliable trading infrastructure for existing
tokens, to facilitating the rise of a long tail of small-scale tokens, to enabling completely
new forms of innovative token market initiatives.  In the following sections, we explore a
few in more depth.
5.1  More Scalable and Reliable Token Markets
The Bancor Network for decentralized liquidity can be used as an alternative to centralized
token exchanges for any token that is connected to the network with numerous positive
implications. For example, a Smart Token with two connectors, with a total CW of exactly
100%, functions similarly to a decentralized token exchange pair. We call this kind of Smart
Token a Relay Token.  (We elaborate on this and other unique Smart Token configurations
in a subsequent section.)  A Relay Token allows users to convert between either of its
connected tokens through an instant two-step process of purchasing the Relay Token with
one of its connected tokens and immediately selling it for the other connected token. Due
to the pricing algorithm, this will cause the price of the Relay Token to rise vis-à-vis the
first connected token (thanks to the purchase), and to fall vis-à-vis the second connected
token (thanks to the sale), exactly as expected.  As discussed earlier, the prices quoted
by a Relay Token are unlikely to differ significantly from prices of either connected token
on external exchanges for long, because an arbitrage opportunity incentivizes arbitrageurs
to even out prices between the Relay Token’s connected tokens and their prices on other
markets.  This particular Smart Token configuration allows existing standard tokens that
do not conform to the Bancor Protocol (i.e., have no connectors) to become backwards
compatible  (i.e., autonomously convertible to/from every token in the network via the
Relay Token), thus increasing the viability and reach of such a liquidity network.
14




Furthermore, when converting tokens through a Smart Token, a user does not directly
deal with a counterparty, nor does a user need to deposit their tokens with an exchange,
resulting in lower risk of tokens being hijacked by hackers or delayed due to other structural
challenges of the exchange business. This stands in contrast to pains experienced by MtGox
and Bitfinex (as examples), which have been hacked with hundreds of millions of dollars
worth of cryptocurrencies stolen from user accounts, or may experience lengthy delays in
token availability.  By aggregating liquidity in one decentralized, autonomous and low-
cost network, users stand to benefit from greater, continuous liquidity and relative price
stability over today’s fragmented and for-profit exchange landscape.
5.2  Long Tail of Small-Scale Tokens
Smart Tokens provide an innovative solution to the liquidity problem that has prevented
the rise of a long tail phenomenon for small-scale or newer tokens (see Section 1).  Recall
that the lack of a sufficient number of buyers and sellers means that there is virtually
no activity around the vast majority of tokens currently in existence.   This is despite
small-scale tokens having a number of productive use cases, such as crowdfunding, local
commerce, community collaboration, and others.
For example, a musician looking to collect funds to record an album can create a new kind
of token and pledge to sell the album exclusively in exchange for this token. She can then
start a crowdfunding campaign where she issues tokens to supporters in proportion to the
size of their contributions.  A supporter who contributes 1% of the contributions during
the campaign will receive 1% of the tokens available. If the album becomes a success, there
will be increased demand for this token.
By the time the album is released, activity around the token may have subsided to a
point where few of the initial supporters are willing to sell their tokens. In today’s illiquid
markets for small-scale tokens, there is a good chance that people interested in the album
may not be able to purchase the tokens needed to buy it. Since a Bancor Smart Token is
always ready to both buy and sell itself, potential album buyers would be able to get the
tokens they need without delay, at a price mathematically calculated relative to the current
buy and sell volumes.  Despite buyers being able to purchase the Smart Tokens from the
contract, as opposed to only from sellers, the existing Smart Token owners do not miss
out, since they in turn can sell their Smart Tokens back to the contract at a later time,
when the calculated price is attractive to them.  This highlights the truly asynchronous
nature of liquidity in the Bancor Protocol.
There are many other examples of small projects that can benefit from having a user-
generated token, including neighborhood tokens that incentivize people to participate in
their local community, platform tokens that are used to prioritize access to limited resources
such as computing power, and more.  Indeed, as the adoption of Smart Tokens facilitate
the rise of a long tail of thousands or millions of diverse tokens, we are sure to witness
15




many novel applications of user-generated tokens, both big and small.  Today, all of this
potential innovation is stifled by the lack of autonomous and asynchronous liquidity, which
creates a chicken and egg game for token creators needing to pre-ensure volume of trade
activity in order to offer the liquidity needed for initial support.
5.3  Enabling New Token Applications
Smart Tokens not only aid with existing problems in secure token conversion and initial and
continuous token illiquidity, but also enable altogether new applications in the emerging
world of blockchain.
Consider the example of Smart Tokens that act as decentralized token arrays thanks to
their numerous connectors. A Smart Token holding numerous connectors with a total CW
of 100% effectively functions as a decentralized token that tracks the combined, pro rata
share adjusted value of a given (and user configured) set of other tokens. Arbitrageurs can
be counted upon to ensure that the Smart Token’s prices rise and fall in sync with the
external market, meaning that the value of the Smart Token will always be up-to-date.
These Smart Tokens enable users to directly hold this type of token without needing a
financial services provider as an intermediary.
Another example may be decentralized applications whose smart contracts require infor-
mation about token exchange rates.  These would conventionally rely on a trusted third
party to relay information onto the blockchain, but using the Bancor Protocol, these smart
contracts could simply query the current price directly from any Smart Token. The Smart
Token acts as an on-chain price oracle, removing the need for external input.
Similarly, it now becomes possible to create decentralized applications that can exchange
services (represented by tokens) directly between them without relying on an external off-
chain procedure.  For example, it would be possible to integrate two services that require
different utility tokens as payment via Bancor’s on-chain conversion mechanism.
These are but a few examples of the new models we may discover when the long tail
of tokens is empowered to emerge, due to a reduced liquidity barrier and other barrier
removals, such as the technical ease of token creation.
6  Smart Token Configurations
While new configurations will continue to emerge, Smart Tokens currently fall into a variety
of categories: Smart Tokens with one connector, two connectors, or more than two connec-
tors; Smart Tokens with a combined total connector weight of 100% or below 100%; and
Smart Tokens with a single yet-to-be-activated connector.  While all Smart Tokens share
certain attributes, each of these configuration combinations has some different attributes.
16




Smart Tokens with a combined connector weight below 100% (and more typically below
20%) are called Liquid Tokens.  These may have one or more connectors.  For example,
BNT is a Liquid Token with a single 10% ETH connector. Liquid Tokens may be purchased
and sold for any of their connected tokens (using the Bancor Formula to determine their
price vis-à-vis their connected tokens) and have an adaptable supply which increases when
bought and decreases when sold.
Smart Tokens with a combined total connector weight of 100% may have one, two or more
connectors. A 100% total weight Smart Token with one connector is called a Proxy Token.
A 100% total weight Smart Token with two connectors is called a Relay Token.  A 100%
total weight Smart Token with three or more connectors is called an Array Token. Proxy,
Relay and Array Tokens may be purchased and sold for any of their connected tokens
(using the Bancor Formula to determine their prices vis-à-vis their connected tokens) and
have an adaptable supply which increases when bought and decreases when sold.  The
connected tokens in any Proxy, Relay or Array Token may be other Smart Tokens, or
any standard ERC20  token with a fixed supply, allowing existing ERC20  tokens to be
backwards compatible with the Bancor Network.
Smart Tokens with a single yet-to-be-activated connector (i.e., a currently empty connector
balance) are called Bounty Tokens, and are useful for distributing to early holders (such as
community supporters) a token that will be launched or distributed in the future. At that
time, a connector balance is deposited and the Bounty Token becomes a Liquid Token,
convertible for the newly connected token.
Smart Tokens which are held as connected tokens by the connectors of multiple other Smart
Tokens are called Network Tokens.                                                                (See more on this in section 8).  For example, since
many Smart Tokens hold BNT in their connectors in order to integrate with the Bancor
Network, BNT can be called a Network Token. It is also a Liquid Token.
7  Bancor Ecosystem
The success of the Bancor Network for decentralized liquidity is contingent on the partici-
pation of a variety of different users. We will briefly give an overview of the key roles that
participants can play in the Bancor ecosystem.
Traders  End-users that hold, convert and transfer Smart Tokens.
Smart Token Issuers  People, companies, communities, organizations or foundations that
issue new Smart Tokens, configuring the initial supply, price, CW, and managing the
initial issuance of tokens.  This also includes creators of Relay Tokens, which can
connect any existing ERC20 tokens to the network.
Asset Tokenizers  Creators of Proxy or Array Tokens that mirror real-world assets or
tokens on other blockchains. These could allow Smart Tokens to connect to a wider
17




palette of assets,  such as Bitcoin,  fiat money, gold or other emerging blockchain
tokens.
Arbitrageurs  Traders that monitor the liquidity network for prices that are inconsistent
with either those of an external exchange or those of another Smart Token, and then
restore price consistency through arbitrage. Arbitrageurs are organically incentivized
to keep prices consistent and hence are important participants in the Bancor ecosys-
tem.  See Section 3.6 for further explanation on the mechanics of arbitrage in the
Bancor Protocol.
8  Bancor Network Token
8.1  Network Tokens
In Section 2.3 we described how a Relay Token with two connectors allows one connected
token to be converted to the other connected through a two-step process of buying the
Relay Token for one and selling it for the other.  As discussed, this two-step process will
allow any token in the network to be convertible for any other, provided they have at
least one connected token in common, at any degree of separation.  We call the common
connected token a Network Token because it links many different Smart Tokens together
into a single network of tokens.
A Network Token functions as a  “token for tokens” by rendering all Smart Tokens in
its network inter-changeable for each other, according to the Bancor Formula automated
price mechanism described in this paper. Increased purchases of any of the tokens in such
a network will also increase the supply of the Network Token (since the supply of its sub
tokens has increased via new deposits of the Network Token into the connector balance).
This upward pressure on the supply of the Network Token in turn affects every other token
in its network, because their own connected token balances have increased.
The Network Token model creates synergetic relationships between member Smart Tokens,
comparable to the way that any single successful Ethereum service drives up the value of
Ether, benefiting the entire Ethereum platform and ecosystem. Numerous use cases exist
for such a network model, including regional networks of community currencies, credits
shared in all games issued by a video game studio, joint loyalty programs supported by a
group of independent businesses, and more.  A Network Token may also be part of other
networks, via its own connectors.
8.2  BNT Token Generation Event
The first Smart Token launched was the Bancor Network Token (BNT), which is used as
the hub Network Token, connecting all tokens in the Bancor Network. BNT currently has
18




a single connector to Ether with a 10% CW, and is managed by the Bprotocol Foundation,
a Swiss nonprofit whose core objective is the promotion of the Bancor Protocol as a global
standard for Smart Tokens which are intrinsically convertible via the Bancor Network for
autonomous, decentralized liquidity.
The contributions to the Token Generation Event of BNT (which took place on June 12,
2017) are used to foster a healthy ecosystem of Bancor-based tokens and applications. New
Smart Tokens that utilize BNT as their connected token will be eligible for support from
the Bprotocol Foundation, in order to encourage adoption of the new Smart Token while
strengthening the existing BNT community through the network effects discussed above.
8.3  Contribution Allocation
In the interest of transparency and full disclosure, the Ether contributed to the BNT Token
Generation Event has been allocated for specific uses as outlined below:
•  20% held by the ETH connector balance of the BNT Smart Token, establishing a
strong and dynamic initial 10% weight.
•  40% deployed to develop the Bancor Protocol and surrounding technologies.  This
includes implementing the Bancor Protocol smart contracts into current and future
blockchains and developing user-friendly applications for the accessibility of Smart
Tokens to end users, such as Smart Token wallets, Smart Token creation and man-
agement interfaces, Smart Token marketplaces and discovery portals, Relay Token
creation, Smart Token governance and reporting, and more.
•  12% used to market the Bancor Protocol and develop the Bancor ecosystem, such as
by supporting innovative and strategic Smart Token projects in the Bancor Network,
and increasing the awareness and understanding of the Bancor Protocol and Bancor
Network globally to relevant audiences. These efforts will ensure a strong community
around the Bancor Network while accelerating the development of a long tail of user-
generated tokens.
•  10% committed to setting up and propelling demonstration Relay Tokens and Array
Tokens for popular ERC20 tokens, as well as Proxy Tokens on the Ethereum platform
for integrating cryptocurrencies from other blockchains, and various real-world assets,
into the Bancor Network.
•  18% designated for operational costs, including legal expenses and other overhead.
Half of the initial supply of BNT Smart Tokens were distributed to contributors, while
the other half is held by the Bprotocol Foundation and allocated to its long-term budget
(locked for two years), the existing and future team and advisors (vested over 2 years),
partnerships (vested over 2 years) and community grants to aid in the long tail adoption
of the Bancor Protocol, as illustrated below:

9  Summary
The new blockchain-based economy has the potential to create an Internet of value con-
sisting of millions of innovative, small-scale, user-generated tokens. The key barrier to this
diverse and resilient future is ensuring that there exists a liquid market for every token
regardless of its volume.  In this white paper, we have proposed the Bancor Protocol for
decentralized liquidity networks, based on a standard for a new class of tokens called Smart
Tokens, which provide continuous liquidity by incorporating an autonomous and low-cost
market making functionality directly into their smart contracts. Smart Tokens utilize con-
nected token balances and an intelligent and open-source formula to perpetually offer to
buy or sell themselves at calculated and predictable prices, in return for any other token
to which they are connected.
At the systemic level, Smart Tokens make up an autonomous global network of intercon-
nected tokens. This novel architecture allows member tokens to be easily convertible for all
other member tokens without risk of illiquidity, while creating network effects that benefit
the entire token ecosystem.
The Bancor Protocol advances the domain of asset exchange by introducing a technological
solution to the double coincidence of wants and resulting liquidity problem faced by small-
scale tokens.  This solution constitutes a reliable and comprehensive alternative to the
labor-based model, which is currently employed by professional market-makers in traditional
financial markets and exchanges.
