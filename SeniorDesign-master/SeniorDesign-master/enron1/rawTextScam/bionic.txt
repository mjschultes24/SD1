INTRODUCTION
 WHAT IS CRYPTO CURRENCY ALL ABOUT
Each Blockchain is associated with a cryptocurrency (also called a token). The
most well-known is the Bitcoin, a currency invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in
2008. Today, there are several hundred different digital currencies.
They all share the common trait of being a virtual means of exchange, not
based in any single state, as opposed to the Dollar or the Euro. They circulate
via peer-to-peer networks, based on cryptographic algorithms, and are not
necessarily intended as a payment system between users.
The number of units in circulation and the maximum money supply are defined
in advance and visible to all. Until proven otherwise, cryptocurrency cannot be
counterfeited or stolen.
It is possible today to define several separate families of cryptocurrency, which
are adapted to the objectives of the communities who use them:
                                                                                   “Infrastructure” currency: the type of currency likely to bring about the
most profound changes, whose ambition goes far beyond being a simple
means of payment, and which has the objective of offering a real
alternative to the existing financial system. Examples: Ethereum, NXT,
Ripple...
                                                                                   “Social” currency: currency created to allow the easy exchange of small
financial amounts between web users  (“social tipping”), on existing
social networks in particular.
  Alternative  currency: broadly inspired by Bitcoin, these currencies
attempt, via technical innovation, to function either more easily, more
securely  or  more  rapidly,  for  example  by  reducing  transaction
verification times. * Examples: Litecoin, Digibyte...

  Anonymous currency: currency created solely to serve as a purely
anonymous means of payment, protecting both the user’s identity as
well as their transactions. * Examples: Monero, Bytecoin…
 BLOCKCHAIN
The Blockchain is a software innovation for establishing digital trust between
users facilitating transactions of value, over a network. The Blockchain enables
trust to be distributed throughout a network, without the need for a central
intermediary to track, verify and approve the digital exchange of value. The
notion of authorizing trust from a central intermediary currently underpins
both private and government institutional structures, however this is proving
to be costly, slow, and also vulnerable to attack. The Blockchain overcomes
these issues by operating as a decentralized distributed database, maintaining
a continuously growing list of records called blocks.
 Smart Contracts
On-chain computer code or "Smart Contracts" are computer protocols that
facilitate,  verify,  and  enforce  the  performance  of  a  contract  making  a
contractual clause unnecessary. Smart contracts often emulate the logic of
contractual clauses. Smart contracts can exchange money, property, shares or
anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way, while avoiding the
services of a middleman. Ordinarily, a process would require payment to a
middleman,  government  agency,  bank,  lawyer  or  a  notary,  and  then  a
processing time before the receipt of goods or services. However, with smart
contract technology it can all be automated. Smart contract technology can be
compared to an automated vending machine. With a vending machine, money
is deposited into the machine and the desired item drops for collection, if the
correct amount is deposited. In comparison, with a smart contract, the money
is deposited into escrow on the Blockchain for a receipt of a transfer of a token
(e.g.  a  digital  certificate  of  title  for  a  house),  which  is  instantaneously
transferred into a counterparty’s control once the conditions are met. Smart

contracts not only define the terms and conditions around an agreement in the
same way that a traditional contract does, but it also provides enforcement of
those obligations.
 WHY BLOCKCHAIN IT WAS ADOPTED FOR BIONIC?
BIONIC is built to operate on Blockchain technology and it will be available on
a Blockchain. BIONIC will be accessed as a DApp (Distributed Application). Our
core reason of adopting Blockchain technology in the development of BIONIC
is  to  provide  a  decentralized  infrastructure  that  is  stable,  secure  and
completely scam free for all the involving parties. This also helps in achieving
our set goal of community-based system, which builds community spirit and
make them the chief controller of the market environment.
These are the reasons why BIONIC (BNC) is built on Blockchain technologies are:
i. Third party interference:
It enables two participating parties to make a secured exchange without the
oversight or intermediation of a third party, therefore reducing, or totally
eliminating counterparty risk.
ii. Empower the BIONIC community of users:
Users are in control of all their information and transactions, therefore the
market environment is totally determined by the community and not by one
central entity.
iii.                                                                                Durability, Reliability, and Longevity:
                                                                                    Thanks to the decentralized networks, Blockchain does not have a central point of
                                                                                    failure and is better able to withstand malicious attacks.
iv.                                                                                 Clearness and immutability - Nothing hidden:
                                                                                    5

Any alterations made to public Blockchains are viewable by all parties, this
creates transparency, and all transactions are immutable, this means that it
cannot be altered or deleted.
WHAT MAKES BIONIC UNIQUE?
BIONIC provides a secured platform for storing and processing digital
transactions in a secure and transparent way  - absolutely SCAM
FREE. Our system is based on the Ethereum Blockchain application
platform implemented by Private Instant Verified Transaction. Our
protocol does what Bitcoin cannot do, it converts publicly viewable
PIV into anonymous PIV therefore, whenever users want to spend
his/her token i.e. sending from User A to User, the token will be
received without history of where the PIV originated from.
BIONIC GOALS
BIONIC is aimed at building a formidable and stable digital currency
platform whereby the transactions between electronic companies
can be simplified.
Electronic companies can buy any electronic device using BIONIC,
Creating new electronic market
- Simplify the financial transactions between electronic companies.
