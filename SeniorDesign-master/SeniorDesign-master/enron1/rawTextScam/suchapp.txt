EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Problem
Today's messaging apps are fundamentally anchored to a very limited paradigm of one-on-one
conversaBons and small unstructured groups. Largely, they fail to provide the necessary tools
required to foster community, sBmulate economic acBvity and encourage lively human interacBon.
The Opportunity
The social media/messaging industry now represents $90 billion worldwide and is expected to grow
to over $120 billion by 2020. However, the funcBonality that is offered to their 3 billion users leaves
much to be desired. With a prepared rollout scheduled for 178 countries and 16 planned localized
versions of the app, SuchApp will provide a new, full-featured messaging ecosystem based on
blockchain technology.
The Solu=on
The app which will enter into public alpha in January 2018, not only provides realBme messaging but
incorporates powerful new features such as locaBon based messaging, 4K broadcast video, granular
security and powerful community and business communicaBons capabiliBes.
Thanks to the integrated cryptocurrency ecosphere based on our ERC20-based SPS token, users will
be able to buy, sell and trade all types of assets and services directly from within the app.
AddiBonally, anyone in the world can create and administer a group on SuchApp leveraging
advanced community features such as a custom loyalty program based on the integrated token.
The Strategy
Unlike most iniBal coin offerings, SuchApp is far from an abstract project waiBng to be commenced.
Thanks to over $1.5 million already invested in development, the applicaBon is nearly ready to
launch globally to the public. Our goal is to posiBon ourselves as one of the top 5 messaging apps in
the world within 5 years.
To accomplish this we will uBlize the funds raised in our iniBal token sale to catapult our user growth
through strategic acquisiBons and sustained organic promoBon.
The Offering
SuchApp will soon announce an iniBal public crowdsale of its SPS token. The total supply of tokens
will be 2.5 billion with a maximum fundraise of $40 million. The ICO price of each token will be
$0.05. Pre-sale phase parBcipants will receive, in addiBon to significantly discounted token prices,
lifeBme Gold Membership within the applicaBon.

OVERVIEW
The social media and messaging industry now represents $90 billion worldwide and is expected to
grow to over $120 billion by 2020. However, the funcBonality that is offered to their 3 billion users
leaves much to be desired. With a prepared rollout scheduled for 178 countries and 16 planned

blockchain technology.
With SuchApp, anyone in the world can create and administer a group on SuchApp leveraging
advanced community features such as a custom loyalty program based on the integrated SPS
cryptocurrency token. Group administrators will be able to culMvate a direct relaMonship with their
customers and can offer them uniquely targeted promoMons.

WHY ARE WE RAISING FUNDS?
We have already invested over l1.5 million of our own funds into the development of SuchApp.
However, to reach our goal of becoming one of the top 5 messaging apps in the world much more
will be needed. We are not too shy to put the actual fgure we need to raise on the 1st page of our
white paper.
Our hard cap is 40 million dollars, and there is good reason for that.
Our markeMng target is to become the messenger of choice for the blockchain community and our
business target is to enter the top-5 list among Messaging ApplicaMons, measured by acMve users
within 5 years.   By that Mme, the market will be worth over l120 billion, and we will be strategically
placed to act as a market leader thanks to the goodwill of the blockchain community and our loyal
supporters across the world.
To achieve the targeted growth strategy, we will need to invest considerably into both organic user
growth as well as execuMng a well planned acquisiMon strategy.  We also plan to conMnue developing
our applicaMon, adding features and integraMng it even more Mghtly into the blockchain.
It is not a secret that most of the messaging apps are cash-negaMve during the frst few years of
operaMonsg and we must have enough cash on hand to fnance our longterm strategic goals.
WHAT WILL TOKEN SALE PARTICIPANTS RECEIVE?
First and foremost, token sale parMcipants will be acquiring SPS tokens at their iniMal highly
discounted price.
The token will have several clear uMlity funcMons within the SuchApp applicaMon:
It will serve as the basis of all product and service purchases within the applicaMon.
It will serve as measurement token of all SuchApp loyalty programs.
It will serve as the exchange mechanism between all user-created loyalty programs.
In addiMon to these inherent uMliMes, we are offering lifeMme Gold Membership Levels to all the
original qualifed investors.
This means that you will be rewarded with certain in-app services for free for as long as your account
stays acMve.

MOTIVATION
OUR STORY
Unlike many ICO projects that start on a mere promise, we bring to the table a solid, robust history
of successful business development with an over 6 year proven track record of genuine customer
acquisi=on.
SuchApp is an instant messaging service developed by Footprint Media Holdings CorporaMon the
parent company of the satellite TV networks High TV 3D and High 4K TV.
Together our media channels reach an audience of 1.3 billion people spread all around the globe.
Headquartered in New York, Footprint Media Holdings CorporaMon was founded in mune 2011 to
provide  innovaMve media services. We now serve 198 countries around the planet providing quality
ad-free content on a daily basis thanks to our 24 full-Mme producMon teams. Due to the internaMonal
nature of our service, we regularly hold conferences and passionately collaborate to achieve
ambiMous goals. The development of SuchApp started with one such meeMng by tech professionals
in the communicaMon industry.
The idea for SuchApp emerged in 2015. A group of tech professionals from the communicaMon
industry met and realized that popular messaging apps used across the world lack some highly
needed  features.  The  discussion  conMnued  and  a  pronect  was  launched  around  the  idea  of
developing an app with features unseen in the current realMme social and messaging apps on the
market. Ideas quickly started pouring in from all quarters. We had many fruikul brainstorming
sessions that reoect the synergisMc group dynamics of our team.  What started in one of our humble
conference rooms steadily grew into SuchApp.
7
Copyright © 2018 SuchApp, All Rights Reserved




We began by discussing the need to develop a popular messaging app that would help people
navigate the world with ease. WeChat was one of the few messengers that provided the enhanced
tools that transformed the basic messenger app into a social and trading network for the Chinese
market. Unlike WeChat, we realized that there was a bigger niche for the full-stack new-era social
communicaMon tool for the growing audience of smartphone users.
By the end of 2015, the pronecths main goal of becoming the UBER of online communicaMons had
evolved into a clear technological concept.  In 2016, the original concept and the team was extended
due to the overwhelming interest in blockchain development and the growing popularity of the
Ethereum plakorm.
With these ideas in mind we set out to integrate the best of blockchain technology with an enMrely
new realMme messaging ecosphere. This is SuchApp.
WHAT DRIVES US?
We are on a quest to build a truly global blockchain messaging app.  All the benefcial features of the
distributed ledger will be deeply integrated into one universal product that combines many common
funcMonaliMes  spread  across  numerous  different  apps
currently  in  use.  Not  only  will  this  enhance  the  user
experience, comfort and convenience, but it will also open
up enMre new opportuniMes for entrepreneurial thinkers.
SuchApp is  80q ready and contains the most up-to-date
features of any messaging app on the market. Thanks to our
state of the art blockchain implementaMon, we will launch
far ahead of the manor players in the market.
Unlike  any  other  messenger  iwhose  popularity  differs
drasMcally  from  country  to  countryj,  we  are  building  a
product that will become LOCAL in every country due to our
advanced RADAR funcMonality. LocaMon based messaging
means that you will always feel at home no marer where
you are.
Furthermore, all our users are united by our SPS coin. The
token will be tradable on manor exchanges and will be widely
used  as  a  payment  alternaMve  for  a  variety  of  naMonal
currencies.
At the end of the day, we believe that our app will become
an important driver for cryptocurrency adopMon all around
the world. As people realize the ease of use of making
purchases  within  SuchApp  and  begin  to  receive  SPS  as
loyalty rewards at businesses they already frequent, both
our  growth  and  that  of  the  enMre  community  will  be
assured.
That  is  our  mission  and  thaths  what  drives  us  to  make
SuchApp as awesome as it can bes

MARKET OVERVIEW
Immense changes are underway in mobile messaging.   Despite the fact that SMS messaging is over
20 years old, it feels as if the medium itself is on the brink of a new era.
One obvious reason for this is the emergence of so-called tOTTh apps, which let users send messages
over IP.   Apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, WeChat and Viber give people the ability to
send video and photos and to easily set up closed groups. These are features that are not readily
available via tradiMonal SMS text messaging.
The Mobile Ecosystem Forum 2016 Messenger Report reveals that internet based apps are now
favored by a manority of end users. For example, 56q of people say they regularly use Facebook
Messenger, while only 42q use SMS messages.
While there has been a shiT away from SMS in person-to-person messaging, the same is not true in
the A2P iapplicaMon-to-personj space. MEFhs study reveals widespread adopMon of A2P messaging
across many verMcals, with fnancial services being the most acMve. Analysts expect the market to
keep growing.  muniper Research says the market may be worth almost l100 billion by 2018, up from
l55 billion in 2013. Some intriguing market developments could drive this expansion. More and
more developers are using simple APIs in their apps to send messages to users. Further ahead is the
intriguing prospect of tconversaMonal commerceh in which brands use bots to talk to customers as if
they were human operators.
It is expected that by 2020 the market will grow to l120 billion, and we believe that SuchApp will be
strategically placed to gain a signifcant share of it. Our Mme-to-market strategy is compeMMve and is
supported by the high level of readiness of the core applicaMon. Also ias you can see from the table
belowj, some of SuchApphs features are going to be exclusive and it will take substanMal Mme and
investment for the exisMng players to replicate our funcMonality.

SPS DIGITAL CURRENCY
Transforming how we handle money
All transacMons that occur within SuchApp are handled in
own digital currency called SPS. This ERC20 compliant toke
serves  as  the  basis  for  the  enMre  fnancial  ecosphere
included in the app.
Not only can users purchase products and services from
businesses that create groups within SuchApp, but the
token serves as the basis for all of the individual loyalty
apps that group administrators implement.
This is especially powerful.
For example, imagine that you run a local restaurant. Per
you  decide  to  create  a  group  especially  for  your  mos
customers and give them a bonus every Mme they come i
your restaurant. This bonus would be stored as SP coins within their digital wallet. Later, aTer
theyhve accrued enough SPS they could exchange them for a free meal.
However, the system gets even berers Next imagine that close by there is a retail store that sells
childrenhs toys that also has a SuchApp group and has set up a similar loyalty scheme. In this case,
your customers could use SPS that youhve awarded them to buy a giT for their kidhs birthdays All of
this happens thanks to the power of the blockchain ecosystem fully integrated into SuchApp.

2. A gamifed community parMcipants award program- We will award tokens to users that enhance
the reach of the plakorm, according to predetermined goals. Build a following - get tokens, offer

SuchApp is not only a social and messaging app but an excellent applicaMon to promote your
business. While promoMng your business, you will have to ensure all your digital fnances and
transacMons are safe and secure. Blockchain technology was developed by an anonymous team who
designed bitcoin. This technology was subsequently used in the release of one of the earliest digital
currency forms, bitcoin, in  2009. Unlike in banks, in blockchain technology, there is no central
repository/central admin for keeping your fnances safe. It is decentralized and uMlizes cryptography
for enhanced database programming and security of confdenMal informaMon. This way your wallet,
fnances and assets will be extra secure.
A Great Way to Manage Corporate Customers
Businesses usually have concurrent offers running during different seasons. These offers oTen are
complex including discounts, vouchers, giT cards for exclusive customers or frst-Mme shoppers, etc.
26

analyze the success and make proftable decisions. Using the powerful combinaMon of SuchApp
Loyalty Management ApplicaMon and SuchApp Phone, you can read and analyze staMsMcs, make
secure transacMons, effecMvely manage revenues at the touch of a few burons. Every loyalty

encrypted in a decentralized environment. This is a great digital alternaMve to the regular banking
process which is usually Mme-consuming, expensive, bureaucraMc and expensive. With our special
SuchApp Credit Card, Digital Wallet and SP Coins, every transacMon can be made inside the world of
SuchApp. This truly makes SuchApp self-suzcient, highly secure, confdenMal, fast and super-
ezcient yet super-simple business applicaMon to run and maintain.

TECHNICAL PAPER
Introduc=on
The following describes the architecture and future implementaMon to be used on the blockchain
layer for the SuchApp pronect. It describes the technicaliMes of the highly secure decentralized
blockchain database programming for the use of digital currency in SuchApp.
Protocol
We will be using a lightweight node implementaMon to be run on mobile devices and embedded into
SuchApp. A lightweight node also known as Simple Payment VerifcaMon iSPVj node does not
download the enMre blockchain locally to perform transacMon validaMons. It downloads only the
headers of the blocks. This avoids having to download the enMre blockchain which would take too
much Mme and consume too much space on a mobile device.   Also, all SuchApp digital currency and
digital wallet users will be assigned private keys which are large integers. The private key is a security
key which is known only to a parMcular user and is used during transacMons.   Through an algorithm,
a public key ianother large integerj is derived from the private key of the user which reoects the
address of the user. Users can send cryptocurrencies to the address of the user in this manner and
vice versa and do transacMons through the private/public key algorithms securely.
For validaMon, blockchain layer of the SuchApp app on the device will connect to a random full node.
It will request all transacMons from the blockchain that are derived by the set of private/public keys
stored in the wallet.
The iniMal sync of the blockchain will take some minutes, but once it is done, we will be able to
detect transacMons involving that wallet in seconds.
The Blockchain Event Manager class of the applicaMon will noMfy when we are in sync ior out of
syncj with the blockchain.
The mava implementaMon of the SPV node will create contracts and transacMons under the ERC20
protocol by adhering to Web3n standards.
28

The blockchain layer will hold the private keys secured in the wallet and interact with the blockchain,
submivng smart contracts and reacMng to triggered events.
SP Coin Issuance
SuchApp Coin isymbol: SPSj will be issued with the following characterisMcs:
Amount                                                                                                    2,500,000,000

SPS iSuchApp Tokenj coin will be issued on Ethereum blockchain by creaMng a smart contract to
issue the tokens.
Full amount of tokens will be delivered to SuchApp admin address upon creaMon.
The SP issuance smart contract will allow exchange operaMons to acquire SPs by any interested party.
SP Coin Wallet
The embedded SP Coin   digital wallet will be a vault of private keys. It will consist of a password-
protected fle on the mobile device that will expose the private keys only when a transacMon needs
signing ito be safely broadcasted through algorithms to public keysj.
Upon creaMon, when a new user for the frst Mme executes SuchApp, the wallet will generate a set of
private/public keys maintained and encrypted inside the local fle. When needed and when those
frst Mme generated keys are used and exhausted, a background process will take care of generaMng
a new set of keys for future usage. The wallet will take care of generaMng new crypto-addresses and
maintain transacMon histories of user-owned transacMons.
Security
Password protec=on
Wallet fle storing the private keys will be secured by the password defned by the user. We will allow
changing of passwords as many Mmes as needed. The user will need to provide the password each
Mme a signature is needed. User-generated transacMons like sending coins to someone else requires
signing the transacMon and using the private key. So, before sending the money, password will be
requested in order to access private key vault. This will prevent a stolen device from emptying the
ownerhs wallet.
Wallet Backup
29
Copyright © 2018 SuchApp, All Rights Reserved




We will enable the user to perform a backup of the wallet ifor stolen, lost cases, etc.j by exporMng
the wallet fle to an SD card or even send it over a chat to someone else. Backup ias the wallet itselfj
is password protected and only usable upon entering the correct password.
The backup of the wallet will contain the seed of all keys generated, meaning that it will allow the
creaMon and incorporaMon of all transacMons ever executed in the blockchain of the original wallet.
In case of a stolen or lost device, the user will be able to recover the wallet with all transacMons and
funds by restoring from backup and providing original password.
Gik Cards
The physical giT cards will be mapped to an SP address with SP funds already assigned to that
address. In order to assign SPs to the card, SuchApp blockchain admin would generate a transacMon
to change balance for the giT card address.
The giT card in addiMon will include the private key data in order to redeem those SPs assigned to
the address.
The GiT Card holder will be able to register giT card on his/her own wallet by reading the |R code
printed on the card. This event will trigger the blockchain layer to search for available funds of the
giT card in the blockchain and update walleths balance accordingly.
Shops or businesses accepMng SuchApp giT cards will be able to swipe and read assigned private
keys of the GiT card. The validated balance will sMll be assigned to the address of the card. The
available balance will be displayed. Depending on the available balance, they will conMnue with the
trading operaMon and generate a new transacMon to deduct the purchase value of the service being
offered, in exchange of the denominaMon in the giT card. Once card funds are exhausted, the same
card can reset the cycle, and more funds can be granted again by blockchain admin.
Gik cards and transac=ons “Gas” Payment
Every smart contract transacMon requires wgasx for a miner to process it and include in the block.
This is the miner wgasx fee and requires ETH iethereum coinsj in the userhs wallet.
For example, a user receives a giT card with SPs that are included into his wallet as new fund.   In
order to transfer those SPs to another user over the blockchain, he may need to pay the fee for a
miner to process this transacMon.
We want to help SuchApp users from not having to spend real money to acquire ETH. In order to do
that, they will be able to call SP smart contract to exchange SPs for real goodsg and the giT card will
be used in the following way:
●   Business Owner, upon swiping and validaMng funds are available for the giT card, will be able
to generate a smart contract call to deduct funds from the giT card. Business owner will be
paying for the transacMon ismart contract callj and must have ETH posiMve balance.
●   Card holder app will respond to the new event triggered by the new giT card transacMon
generated by the business owner, verify the transacMon affecMng the address of the giT card
previously registered, and update balance in the wallet.
30

In this way, the giT card holder does not need to spend money on gevng ETH to be able to generate
a smart contract call to update balance, and it is the business ownerhs responsibility to pay the fee of
this transacMon.
Card holder balance is updated from the blockchain itself and not from generaMng new transacMons
when funds on the card are used.
Transac=ons between users
TransacMons between users, like sending SPs gained by registering a GiT Card, will not be enabled for
transfer to another contact, unless the user owns ETH to be able to pay the miner fee.
In this case, the wallet is loaded with ETHg then, the user will be able to transfer his SPs to another
contact.

The nava API will consist of the following modules:
Backup Restore manager: Responsible for generaMng backups of the exisMng wallet or creaMng a
new wallet from an exisMng backup.

TOKEN UTILIZATION WITHIN SUCHAPP
Token uMlizaMon within SuchApp is one of its key features.
We promote open and transparent dialogue with our contributors and followers.   So, we have been
using William Mougayarhs approach to clearly defne the value and benefts of the SP coins for our
supporters.  The framework provides 3 tenets for the token uMlity: Role { Features { Purpose.
APPLICATION OF THE MOUGAYAR’S TOKEN FRAMEWORK IN SUCHAPP MESSENGER
THE RIGHTS
The holders of SP coins would have certain rights based on several factors:
ICO Value contributor’s rights
All our original supporters who acquired more than 200,000 SP Coins during Pre-ICO and ICO get the
right:
   To  own  and  become  original  users  of  the  special  ICO-ediMon  of  SuchApp  blockchain
smartphone with the frst versions of SuchApp App downloaded and ready to use when
SuchApp is launched.
   To claim the Golden Status of Group Administrator features in the SuchApp app for the
period of 3 years aTer the launch of the product

SP coin Value Holders rights
In the post-ICO period, the value holders of the SP Coins in excess of 250,000 SPS who would like to
become acMve members of the SuchApp community have the rights:
1.  To claim the Silver Status of Group Administrator features in the SuchApp app}
2.  To use selected paid SuchApp app services for free}
Notes:
*- to qualify for this right, the holder of SP Coins must keep in excess of 250,000 SP coins in SuchApp’s Reserve
Wallet. This right would be ceased when the SP Coins are withdrawn from the Reserve Wallet by the owner.
In addiBon the holder will receive 2 months of benefits stated in secBons 1 and 2 for free AFTER the SP Coins
are withdrawn from the SuchApp’s Reserve Wallet.
VALUE EXCHANGE
SP Coin will be the fundamental measure of value for all products and services sold within SuchApp.
User Case 1:
mohn is a writer. He writes arMcles for magazines. He is a member of the fan group of Portland Trail
Blazers NBA basketball team in SuchApp which has 23123 members in it. He also loves music and
would like to learn to play the piano. mohn has a SuchApp wallet with 1000 SPS on it. Here are some
of the opMons that he can use them with:
1.  He can buy a Shout message from the SuchApphs Ad Service that targets parMcular areas for
100 SPS adverMsing his services.
2.  He can search the shouts database and acquire the contact details for the Piano teaching
services that are offered in his area for 10 SPS.
3.  He can also buy a Shout message from the Trail Blazershs Group Administrator for 50 SPS to
either sell his service or buy the one he requires.
User Case 2
Marina sells hand-made dolls and has a small catalogue of her products with a shopping cart on her
SuchApp profle page. She can adverMse her products in the same way as mohn above. When
somebody likes her blond doll worth 1000 SPS, this customer can pay for it via a SuchApp Debit or
GiT card using the simple Smart Contract built-into the Checkout algorithm within SuchApphs
Shopping Cart feature.
TOLL
The toll feature in SuchApp is used in the following ways:
   Access fee for the closed/VIP Groups
   Access fee for certain resources and informaMon within SuchApp
   Monthly Membership fees for Group Administrators
   Monthly Exposure fees for the Service providers in RADAR service.
There are more features to come.
FUNCTION
34
Copyright © 2018 SuchApp, All Rights Reserved




Some of the features within SuchApp will require payment for accessing some services or content,
connecMng to the users and providing the incenMves.
User Case 1
Fred was searching SuchApphs RADAR service and the map showed several girls within 3 miles from
his house, one was looking totally his type. Since Emma ithe girl he likedj was not part of his circle,
he has an opMon to pay 35 SPS In order to send her a private message and introduce himself.
User Case 2
~hang Wei i                                                                                               张伟 j is hungry and would like to order some takeaway i带⾛走 j. He searches his RADAR
and fnds Lao Sze Chuan restaurant few blocks away. ConnecMng and making an order would not cost
anything to ~hang Wei, but the restaurant would pay SuchApp 40 SPS fxed commission for the
placed order through SuchApp.
User Case 3
Every Group Administrator who reaches 1000 subscripMon target will receive a reward of 1000 SPS
and SuchApphs blockchain Smartphone for free.
THE CURRENCY
SPS token shall be openly used for internal payments for products and services in SuchApp. It would
also be one of the currencies that our Debit and GiT Cards can be denominaMng in.
We realize the importance of the liquidity, volaMlity and value issues surrounding any currency ifat
or cryptoj in circulaMon and SP Coin is not the excepMon here. Saying that, we are taking measures to
miMgate these issues:
1.  We have reached preliminary agreement for SPS token lisMng on 2 manor exchanges from the
top-20 list.
2.  We are to introduce the SuchApphs Reserve Wallet system for the variety of services that
would cut the supply of SP Coins to the open market for the short-term speculaMve gains.
3.  We are planning to use up to 5q of the funds raised during the ICO crowd sale to support
the Market Maker trading strategies on the exchanges to fght off the aracks on SP Coin by
the speculators.
EARNINGS
SuchApphs SPS token is not a security, and nothing in this document should be construed as an
offering of a security interest. SP Coin iSPS Tokenj is a uMlity token that would be uMlized within
SuchApphs messaging app in the best possible manner to make SuchApphs popularity among users
grow and drive the value of SPS tokens up as well.
It is in our plans to become one of the top Messengers iby acMve user numbersj in the world within
5 years of operaMons.
