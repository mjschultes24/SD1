BitSong is a new platform, which will be built using the blockchain
ABSTRACT
technologies and the IPFS distributed file system.
The focus of the developers is one near to their heart. It is a project dedicated
to musicians and attempts to solve a major problem for emerging artists.
Through Bitsong, musicians will have the opportunity of producing their own
songs and listeners will enjoy and hear new content from any device they own.
BitSong will provide the user with the possibility of using the platform in a
number of ways from, free streaming, to requests for donations, payments
and the insertion of advertising sponsors.

Using the blockchain affords Bitsong with the mean to be decentralized and
be more community - based compared to its competitors. Currently viewing
a music video is via YouTube, listening and streaming is via Spotify, mar-
keting is on iTunes or Beatport and advertising is on social media. BitSong
aims to solve this problem once and for all.

fans on one single decentralized music platform.

in which the artist will promote his music (only users holding BTSG tokens
can express their preference) . In addition to the official Web Radio / TV,
there will also be the possibility to open a streaming channel where you
can broadcast your events, or perform live via our platform.
BLOCKCHAIN                                                                    Today musical rankings are easily influenced or modified by external spon-

like, comments and anything else) on its own blockchain, thus generating
the first verifiable and above all, real music classification for rankings.
Our aim is to evolve as the world of blockchain evolves and create new op-
portunities for the artists and for our community to support our platform.

When an artist creates a new single or musical album, he must invest his time
PROBLEM
to create that piece from an original idea through to the product.
They finance it with their own money, contact a record label in the hope that
they are interested in the song, investing and publishing it to get the most
sales. This all takes many months before the first incomes can be achieved .
FUNDS                                                                                Often however, this does not happen, as the artist does not have the ne-
cessary funds to create a music video, because he does not have the right
contacts, and because the record labels (given the huge amount of songs
they receive) rarely invest time and effort into a song. An artist can often
find they have spent substancial time and funds without gains or revenue.
BitSong, due to the blockchain technologies, finally can solve these pro-
blems that hinder emerging artists within the world of music.
ADVERTISER                                                                           Bitsong will provide opportunities for the advertiser to easily reach their
audience, thus avoiding intermediaries who only increase the advertising
cost. We will give them the choice to choose the amount to invest in each
individual advertising.
In addition, advertisers will get data to measure the results of their marketing
campaign.
EARNINGS                                                                             Think about the last time you used a streamining platform, listening or watching
music videos containing advertisments. You negotiated the use of the platform
by giving away your time while adverts played. You gave away your time wi-
thout getting anything out of it. Bitsong aims to change that by giving the user
who listens to the music, the chance to be paid for listening to the advertisement
within the piece of music, or simply by listening to music. Ten percent of the
amount  will  be  retained  by  BitSong  for  ongoing  costs  of  developing the
platform and the remaining 75% will be divided between the user who listens
and the artist who creates the song, while 15% is dedicated to our Blockchain
Validators.
MIGRATION
Moreover, thanks to our innovative listening platform paying for user attention,
we strongly believe users will abandon the traditional ecosystems of listening
to music, by using BitSong on any device (TV, Smartphone, PC, Car Radio).

BitSong has resolved problems for the artist by permitting them to upload their
SOLUTION
songs without any need for a record label.
The artist can receive donations in BTSG tokens which can be converted to
cash or it can help sponsor the development of their own piece of music.
Artists can also get revenues from advertising generated by their piece of
music and by reselling their own songs.   This will be enhanced by the social
network created on the Bitsong platform and the loyalty of fans.
Funds via the Bitsong token $ BTSG will be credited to the artist wallet imme-
CRYPTO WALLET
diately and they will be able to withdraw or convert as they see fit.
Artists need no longer wait several months before a record label sends va-
REAL TIME PRO-
rious reports, they can check the progress in real time directly within the
GRESS
Wallet.
NO INTERMEDIARIES                                                                    Through BitSong, the advertiser will also have greater clarity on costs and
will not have to pay additional intermediaries. They can create their own
advertising campaign through a special advertising tool within the Bitsong
platform, choosing the appropriate target.
Once a target is selected, the advertiser can choose the amount (in $ BTSG)
he wants to invest for each advertising session. The higher the bid, the more
visibility the advertising will have. Finally the advertiser will not have to pay
astronomical figures, as BitSong completely eliminates the intermediaries
and allows the advertiser to decide the budget they wish to spend for indivi-
dual advertising.
BitSong accepts within their platform, all songs, that are not plagiarism, but
NO PLAGIARISM
the result of the originality and work of an artist, without thereby harming the
work of other artists.
In the event that our technology detects that a song has already been re-
gistered previously by other users, the BitSong platform will require further
verification through the official social profiles and certificates, to protect the
work of the individual artist.

In recent years, the music industry has experienced a huge increase in sales
MARKET
thanks to the streaming and sale of digital albums.
IFPI (International Federation of the Phonographic Industry) has indicated     17.4 BILLION USD
how the music industry has achieved a 5.9% increase in sales of digital
albums, on a market capitalization of 17.4 billion USD.
The music industry is projected to grow exponentially over the next few        52 BILLION USD
years and is expected to reach a $ 52 billion USD capitalization by 2020.
The revenues arising from music streaming show a sharp increase and the
trend remains bullish. At BitSong, we are revolutionizing the music industry
by making the user and artist the main actors.

Our goal has always been to write not only all transactions in Blockchain, but also all
the streamings and we do not want to deviate from this path.
BITSONG'S PROTOCOL
To do this, we need a fast and scalable Blockchain, but above all without fees or
microscopic fees. During our journey, we tried and tried hundreds of solutions,
starting from Ethereum (on which it is impossible to develop a platform like ours) up to
the most recent and we found that none could fit perfectly to our needs, which led us
to seriously consider building our own Blockchain.
After months of study, we discovered Cosmos Network, which opened up a new
world with a wider vision. Cosmos allows you to build your own Blockchain, adapt it        100,000 TRANSACTION
to all your needs and also allows you to connect more Blockchain to each other, with
PER SECOND
staggering speeds, such as: 100,000 transactions per second and without fees.
We decided to build our Blockchain by leaning on the Cosmos Network, using the
"Tendermint" consent algorithm and thus automatically implementing the Proof of
Stake.
Thanks to these innovations, we not only emigrate from Ethereum, but we are no
longer dependent on advertising on the platform, we have our own Blockchain, totally       PROOF OF STAKE
distributed (open source) and we make our Token in this way, minable. With the
introduction of the Pos (Proof of Stake), anyone can become a validator of our
Blockchain, depending on the amount of token held, the more you hold, the greater
the chances that you become a validator of the Blockchain of BitSong.
What are the advantages of being a Validator of our Blockchain?
VALIDATORS                                                                                 - You will undermine the BTSG
- You will take 15% fee of all transactions that are carried out on our platform.
The revenue in this way will come from the Miners and all that is produced will go in
the reward pool, in which they will be blocked, until a claim (stream, like, comment,
etc) is made, thus making the advertising, a alternative instrument, which will offer
greater volumes to our currency.
The pool will be divided as follows:
REWARDING POOL                                                                             -                               75% will be dedicated to artists and their listeners (division performed through
                                                                                           mathematical algorithm)
                                                                                           -                               15% will be dedicated to our Validators
                                                                                           -                               10% will be retained by the platform for various developments and services
Obviously we are taking care to avoid abuse or any kind of spam on the platform,
introducing a "bandwith", which will allow you to listen to music for a certain time a
day, which will increase according to your activity on the platform and seniority .
BANDWITH
Practically more seniority and social activity you will have on the platform, the more
benefits you will get from it, not only in terms of "bandwith", but also in rewarding
(eg John joining BitSong today, he will not get the same amount of tokens that takes
David, who has signed up and has been active for a year).

Cosmos is a network of independent parallel blockchains that are each
powered by classical BFT consensus algorithms like Tendermint.
COSMOS EXPLAINED
Cosmos is a launch pad for new cryptocurrencies, upgrades to existing
cryptocurrencies, innovation decentralized applications and a platform for
smart contracts.
These contracts can be used safely to perform a large number of
operations: electoral systems, registration of domain names, financial
COSMOS-BASED
markets, crow-dfunding platforms, intellectual property, etc.
TRANSACTIONS
Cosmos goes beyond a single distributed ledger, paving the way for a free
market “Internet of Blockchains”. Developers can use this technology to
create their own blockchain to compete or complement the Cosmos Hub.
Tendermint is a low-level protocol comprised of two main pieces: a
blockchain consensus engine and a generic application interface.

Tendermint Core, the blockchain consensus engine, facilitates the peer-to-
peer network and provides a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus. The
Application BlockChain Interface (ABCI), on the other hand, acts as a tool
for blockchains to link onto the Tendermint Core protocol.
The purpose of Tendermint is to be a blockchain engine. It’s meant to be a
BLOCKCHAIN ENGINE
tool that developers can use to skip the nasty and technical cryptography
and jump into the higher level blockchain and application development.

Proof of stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency
PoS
blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus.
PROOF OF STAKE
In PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen via
various combinations of random selection and wealth or age (i.e., the
stake).
In contrast, the algorithm of proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies such as
bitcoin uses mining; that is, the solving of computationally intensive puzzles
to validate transactions and create new blocks.
