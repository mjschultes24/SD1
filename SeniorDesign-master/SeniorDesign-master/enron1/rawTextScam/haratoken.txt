BLOCKCHAIN FOR
BETTER DECISIONS
A global & transparent
blockchain-based
data exchange
Whitepaper v1.02
Updated: November 19, 2018




Executive Summary
Today society produces a huge amount of data each and everyday. In 2016, we generated
16.1 zettabytes of data and that number is expected to grow ten-fold by 2025.   Data is now a
vital element of all aspects of our daily lives.   The growth of real-time data is enabling better
data driven decisions in many socially impactful sectors such as: health, education, public
transportation, technology, and urban planning. Data is addressing a range of societal issues
and creating a more prosperous, safer, and healthier future for the next generations.
However, only a small fraction of data is analyzed. Many organizations have collected vast
amounts of data just to let it sit dormant in silos. Furthermore, users who have access to the
internet are losing the value of their own data to few centralized platforms. Those who are
digitally excluded, while also generating data everyday, are always at a loss since very little
of their data is captured with the intention of benefitting their lives. The year is 2018, and yet,
everyday we lose so much valuable data that could improve productivity and benefit to many.
The arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology is improving data accessibility
by removing endless layers of friction. The Dattabot team as a leading big data company in
Indonesia has been successful in providing access to data and bringing valuable insights across
industries. Now, a combination of AI and blockchain is unleashing the next phase of our mission:
to democratize data for the world›s most socially impactful sectors. Starting with the food sector,
Dattabot, as the parent company, is developing HARA into a decentralized data exchange.
This ecosystem brings data symmetry to all players and incentivizes participants to continuously
partake in a virtuous cycle. All proceeds raised from the Initial Token Sale (ITS) is used by HARA to
continue building the platform, expand its ecosystem, and fund its incentive mechanisms. HARA
aims to help people, especially those who are at the bottom of the wealth pyramid, to make
better decisions and improve their livelihood.
The value of data comes from its accuracy. The moment new data enters the system, data
qualifiers are incentivized to validate the data which acts as a crowd-sourced indicator of its
quality. Overtime, this will help improve the overall robustness of the data and help generate
healthy, ongoing demand. Furthermore, data also becomes more valuable when it is processed,
so HARA also provides an ‘enriched data’ category that allows data buyers to resubmit data
that has been analyzed and rendered useful - all the while sharing proceeds with the original
data provider(s). The platform will be automated by the smart contracts on HARA’s blockchain
and different methods of data submissions, including: the HARA suite of mobile apps, Internet of
Things (IoT) devices, satellites data, imagery and more. Since Dattabot has been in the media
and big data business for years, it already has relationships with businesses in all sectors, financial
institutions, scientists, governments, NGOs, and educators who are ready, willing, and able to
afford access to this rare and crucial data. HARA data exchange already has critical use cases
that are needed to be solved today.




Executive Summary
Before the democratization of data, different silos of data sets were not linked together and
were controlled by separate central institutions. Therefore, these use cases below will be difficult
to realize without HARA’s decentralized data exchange. Some of the immediate benefits that
players will see:

all players
yy                                                                                                         Biotech firms can accelerate the evolution in microbiology supporting effective substitutes for
chemical and otherwise toxic farm inputs
yy                                                                                                         Smallholders and family farmers now have agronomical data, online-advice and market
information, such prices and off take-volumes of products and farm inputs on a micro-market
level in a timely fashion
Data empowers billions and levels the playing field for everyone. With a traceable and transparent
data exchange, we do not have to lose any more valuable data and players of all sizes will have
access to the data we generate collectively every day. Beginning with the food sector, HARA will
touch up to 1 billion people in the planet and work its way up to the value chains of health, education,
mobility, and recreation sectors.
Starting with one byte at a time.

Established in 2003 as Mediatrac, Dattabot’s origins were “big data” and content acquisition from
online and offline sources. Our company amassed an immense volume of data in its linguistic
database and through AI applications, enabled computers to understand, digitize and curate
Indonesian-language-content from all media sources. From this platform, we aided business customers
with data-driven consulting services, geo-demographic data, and media monitoring services.
In 2016, the company rebranded itself as Dattabot. Still a leader in big data analytics, we have
extended our services portfolio to include systems integration, industrial internet, and our Big
Data Dojo. Our technology platform now encompasses leading edge proprietary AI software
applications, IoT integrations and further advancements in big data to deliver groundbreaking
solutions for big problems.
Below is a glimpse of accomplishments that characterize our journey:
y  Dattabot is the leading company in big data analytics, territory management, supply-chain
optimization, document digitalization, text analytics, consumer profiling and marketing analytics
y  Created the first Indonesia’s contextual legal taxonomy
y  First start-up company in the world to establish a partnership with GE Digital to serve industrial
internet market on a big data industry
y  The only start-up to be invited and speak at an internal World Bank Group retreat in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia in March 2018 with a focus on technology disruption in social impact sectors
We realize that data equals power, but we are not the only one to realize it. More and more
private firms now focus their attention on data mining. They collect, analyze, and sell personal
data to corporations, marketers, governments and even political parties. This data gives them
an informational advantage that not only provides limitless strategies to beat their competitors
but also leads to the misuse and abuse of data. While these private firms are generating massive
profits, their users, do not receive any benefits from it and in many cases do not even have
access to their own data. At Dattabot, we believe in data democratization. Not only should all
users have access to the data, but they should also be rewarded for the data they provide.

Understanding of a
human rights issue gained
from studying information
about it.
KNOWLEDGE
Data, that is selected,
organised and presented

INFORMATION
Raw facts. Unorganised.
Uncurated
DATA
The more data we have, the more problems we solve. If we could increase access to data,
we could develop innovative solutions to innumerable problems and to identify limitless
opportunities. With data democratization in mind, we believe we owe our data to society and
to the individuals who continuously contribute, byte by byte. Building a technology platform that
could ensure economic and informational equality to all users in the data ecosystem is our way
to give back to society, particularly those who are at the bottom of the wealth pyramid: the
largest yet the poorest and the most digitally excluded socio-economic group.
Coming from Indonesia, we understand the economic and informational inequalities suffered
by those living in the digitally excluded world. Dattabot is focused on solving large societal
problems. We want to accomplish this mission by developing HARA’s decentralized data
exchange and ecosystem which will support better data-driven decisions for data buyers and
incentivize data providers to share their data. It is our dream to create a virtuous cycle that could
help all users to fully embrace the opportunities in this new era of data age.

sectors
The advancement of technology also advances our ability to collect, manage, process, and
deliver data. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), the world will produce and
replicate approximately 163ZB of data by 2025, or a tenfold increase from the amount of data
created in 20161.   Data driven decision-making is crucial to gaining a competitive advantage. It
is not only vital for business operations but also for consumers, governments, and society at large.
It offers limitless possibility to address a range of societal issues across many sectors, from food,
health, education, transportation, technology to economic sectors.
According to McKinsey only 1% of data is collected and analyzed2. Considering the considerable
investment for data collection, management and analytics, data acquisition can be too
costly for many organizations. On the other hand, there are some organizations that own vast
amounts of data but failed to realize the potential of sharing the data and extracting insights
that were previously unimaginable. Furthermore, data quality has always been a concern.
Since organizations are the only ones responsible for data management and analytics, they
must allocate considerable resources and time to maintain data integrity, accountability,
and security. Ensuring the precision of data, consistency, trustworthiness, avoiding bias, and
anticipating security threats are crucial in producing good quality data. Data should also be
traceable back to its original source while being made transparent and reliable. Poor quality
data from unreliable sources is the biggest risk in data-driven decision-making and can lead to
formulation of damaging strategies.

As the use of connected devices is rapidly becoming more widespread, the average person’s
level of interaction with data also dramatically increases. Currently, only a few centralized
institutions are capturing and formulating data into insights, leaving the original data provider at
a loss. IDC estimates that an average connected person anywhere in the world  will interact with
devices nearly 4,800 times per day — basically one interaction every 18 seconds by 20253. This
contributes to the huge amount data being generated and drives the importance of personal
data. However, these people do not have access to their own data nor are they gaining any
benefits from of it. Across the world, vulnerable communities and the digitally excluded lose when
the few powerful centralized platforms decide what to do and what not to do with their data.
While these issues occur in all sectors, we would like to focus our attention on the agriculture
and food sector due to its role in expanding economic opportunities at multiple levels of society.
Food is the most fundamental need and billions of people depend on cultivating, processing,
and selling food, particularly in developing countries where agriculture plays a vital role in
economic development. The lack of near-time valuable data creates many hidden problems to
all stakeholders across the agriculture and food value chain, for example:
•y Farmers, particularly in developing countries, have little to no access to agricultural data and
market information that could reduce productivity loss and increase profits.
•y High percentage of food is wasted through inefficiencies in the food supply chain due to lack
of location-specific and market data.
•y Agriculture insurance companies are unable to predict weather and climate risks as well as
production value due to lack of cultivation and ecological data.
•y A customer today would want to know where a juice comes from, how it was produced, or if
it was exposed to harmful materials since being produced. This information does not exist.
•y Our transportation system is unable to satisfy public food demand or needs with public
policies that are developed with minimal real-time data.
These problems occur due to several reasons. First, only few centralized institutions collect, store,
and analyze specific agricultural and food-related sector data. It limits data accessibility to
stakeholders in this sector, particularly smallholder players and individual users. Second, some
data is simply not available. Individuals, groups, and regions may be at a disadvantage due to
lack of access to technological infrastructure, related skills and tools to produce and utilize data
in ways that benefit their lives and communities.

HARA is a marriage between digitalizing the bottom of the pyramid and creating
visibility across the agriculture industry.
HARA aims to target three growing industries, which are: agriculture and food sector, data
commercial market, and digital advertising. Data collected in the HARA data exchange
platform will be of great benefit in improving productivity and efficiencies as well as facilitating
market expansion and fair playing field in these industries.
Agriculture and Food Sector
HARA starts with the agriculture and food sector in order to address one of the world’s most
fundamental problems: food security. According to Department of Economics and Social Affairs of
the UN, the current world population of 7.6 billion is expected to reach 8.6 billion in 2030, 9.6 billion
in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. The majority of growth will occur  in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa4.
Consequently, the global agriculture and food sector is changing rapidly because of the intensive
increase of global food demand. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that food
production will need to increase by 100% globally to ensure food security in 20505 and to meet 70%
increase in caloric demand. There is a clear need for improvement in the sector’s technological,
infrastructural, and institutional basis to ensure its sustainable development.
One of the biggest challenges in ensuring food security is to make the agriculture and food
system to be more effective, inclusive, and resilient. The global agriculture and food sector is
worth US$ 5 trillion and represents 10% of consumer spending and 40% of the employment6.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates the combined global
gross production of cereal, crops, and livestock to be nearly $4 trillion. Moreover, global food
exports grew by approximately 45% between 2006 and 2016. However, according to the FAO,
approximately 30% of global food production or 1.3 billion tons of food is either lost or wasted7.
It is estimated that global food waste and loss cost $940 billion a year8. In developing countries,
32% of total loss occurs during production and handling9, mainly caused by managerial and
technical limitations during storage, transportation, processing, packaging and marketing of the
food production.
To solve these problems, the agriculture and food sector needs to embrace the potentials of digital
innovations that could increase productivity, supply-chain and market efficiencies. As the sector
involves a wide range of stakeholders, from input suppliers, logistics, traders, financial services to
data companies, access to near-time valuable data is extremely crucial to link information from
diverse points across the value chain. It will increase the capacity to absorb foreign and domestic
knowledge and better respond to the dynamics of the supply-chain and the market.

Innovations such as precision agriculture enable the collection of valuable data that will provide all
stakeholders with new opportunities. Precision agriculture is a modern farming management tactic
that utilizes IoT, big data, and satellite imagery to maximize resources and improve productivity.
Combining different data sources is particularly important because agriculture is very location-
specific. Water, land, weather, and climate characteristics are largely varied from one area to
another, the proximity of a given farming operation to the marketplace and the logistic also differs
greatly from location to location. In addition, farming methods and practices are influenced by
local values and cultural roots, which result in distinctive behavior and decisions made on the
farm. Precision agriculture is one of the vital components in the smart agriculture market. The smart
agriculture market alone is projected to grow from $5.18 billion in 2016 to $11.23 billion by 2022, at a
compound annual growth rate of 13.27% between 2017 and 2022.
Initial Target Countries
Aligned with Dattabot’s mission to ensure economic and informational equality for all, HARA
focuses on the agriculture and food sector in developing countries. Increased agricultural
productivity plays a vital role in alleviating poverty in these areas. Various studies have found that
there are “significant relationships between productivity growth and poverty and nutrition, and
the agriculture had a greater impact on poverty than the other sectors”10. Attempts to quantify
the impact of poverty abatement through increased of agriculture productivity estimates that
one percent (1%) increase in productivity reduces the percentage of people living on less than a
dollar per day by between 0.6% and 1.2%.11
Furthermore, in developing countries where critical agricultural data is more difficult to find,
having a decentralized data exchange platform will solve the painful problems of data
asymmetry. Access to the market and agricultural data remains key challenge for farmers in
these countries and will push the adoption of HARA platform. Starting from the needs of financial
inclusions enabled by the financial institutions, to food traceability, precision agriculture, logistics,
supply chain and general market place.
Our pilot project shows that the impact is big. This impact has not gone unnoticed and is
reflected by the supports HARA receives from: International NGOs; multinational and national
banks; insurance companies; support from local governments and communities; and also
national and international media.
The markets that HARA will focus on are developing countries located near the equator,
characterized by long growing periods (many are year-round), and where access to mobile
phone service is available. Dattabot has identified eight (8) countries that possess these
attributes, where collectively, these countries represent nearly one third of all smallholder farmers
in the world, which are:
Bangladesh                                                                                                               Indonesia   Vietnam   Thailand

Below is the analysis of the size of agriculture and food sector, as well as internet and mobile
penetration to ensure that HARA platform will be easily adopted in these countries. We also
considered financial services penetration, as it can be used to measure growth potentials in
the agriculture and food sector. In addition, financial services can also utilize HARA platform
to expand their business opportunities by touching previously untapped segments, such as
smallholder farmers, due to lack of valuable data.
Agriculture and Food Sector: Brief Overview
The agriculture and food sector is crucial in these countries. Agriculture employed almost 200
million people, or equal to 23% of total population. Furthermore, with Peru as an exception,
more than 30% of land area is used for agricultural purposes (areas that are characterized as
arable, under permanent crops, and under permanent pastures)12. In Bangladesh and Uganda,
agricultural land constitutes more than 70% of total land area thus highlights how important
agricultural sector in these countries. In size wise, Mexico has the largest agricultural land with
more than 1 million square kilometer. In total, agricultural production value in these eight
countries is worth US$ 499 billion, of which food production (e.g. cereals, food crops, and dairy
products) contributes to almost 90% of total production.

all have relatively high internet penetration rate13. Kenya and Thailand have highest penetration
with up to 85% of the population already connected to the internet. In terms of size, Indonesia
has the largest internet-connected population with approximately 140 million users. Mobile
penetration rate is also very high. Seven out of 8 countries have more than 80% penetration
rate. With the requisite mobile connectivity in place, the HARA Ecosystem solution is ready for
deployment in these countries.

Financial services
The development of agriculture and food sector requires financial services to support bigger
investment of agriculture-related infrastructure and other production-related resources. Thus, it is
important to have an overview of financial service industries and its potentials in the target countries.
All target countries have high potentials in mobile and banking/microfinance institutions
reach. According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC)14, Indonesia, for example, is
categorized as a major potential country as it has large unbanked population and high mobile
penetration. Other target countries, which are: Kenya, Mexico, Uganda, Vietnam, and Thailand,
are categorized as quick risers. This category has high mobile penetration and high adoption
rate in mobile money or digital wallet. Mobile money or digital wallet can improve efficiencies
across the food value chain and open the opportunities to utilize mobile-based technology to
advance agricultural operations. For example, in Kenya, MFarm developed an app providing
up-to-date market prices for agricultural products. This app also links farmers with buyers with a
group-selling service that facilitates smallholder farmers to market their products to large buyers15.

Despite the potentials of banking reach, microfinance institutions are still the key to improve
financial access to agriculture workers in developing countries, given its advantage in proximity
to the customers and its frequent association with more cooperative financing approaches.
Some of the target countries, which are: Vietnam, Bangladesh, Peru, and Mexico, are among
the top 10 countries for micro-loan portfolio outreach as shown in the table below:

To conclude, our initial target is developing countries where agriculture has been vital to the
country’s economic development. Agricultural land occupies large percentage of total land
area and has been one of the main sources of employment. These countries also have high
internet and mobile penetration rate, which are the requisite for the adoption of HARA platform.
In addition, combination of high mobile and banking/microfinance institutions reach increases
the potentials for HARA and its incentive system to be accepted by farmers as data providers.
Despite limited data available to illustrate the food value chain in these countries, our local
knowledge assures us that these countries are promising markets that are suitable to be the focus
of our data collection.
Data Commercial Market
As previously stated, vast amounts of data is underutilized. Many organizations are still reluctant
to invest in data management due to its high cost of data acquisition as well as limited
strategic and human resources to convert cost of data management into assets. It creates
big opportunities for players in the data commercial market. It is estimated that big data
and analytics sales will reach US$187 billion by 2019, an increase of over 50% to 2015 levels.
Furthermore, PWC estimated that revenue from commercializing financial data could be worth
US$300 billion annually by 2018 with 10.38% compound annual growth. A Capgemini survey
supports the PWC finding, in which 61% respondents state that big data is now a driver of
revenues in its own right.

Digital Advertising and Adoption
HARA focuses on the bottom of the pyramid data. This group previously received little attention
resulting in limited data availability. HARA offers limitless potentials of data commercialization,
particularly in the digital advertising to reach this particular market. The digital advertising industry
is projected to continue to experience remarkable growth through 2021 to reach almost USD
100 billion in annual revenue, with mobile and social advertising becoming the top destinations,
which the latter expected to double in size to USD 30.8 billion by 2021. Furthermore, in the Global
Advertising Forecast report published in December 2016, Magna estimated revenues from
digital advertising for 2016 to be over $178 billion (36% of the total global spend of $493 billion).
Approximately 54% of this was shared between Google and Facebook. Magna expects this 36%
figure to rise to 50% of the total by 2021 (i.e., $300 billions of an estimated $600 billion). Digital
advertising revenues are thus considerable, averaging about $89 per internet user, and $287 per
US Internet user, and they are projected to grow at 11% annually.
In addition, HARA platform facilitates data democratization that incentivizes owner of the data
or data providers. It prevents unethical/unfair data commercialization practice that only benefits
few centralized platforms that has been collecting and managing data. The market is huge, for
instance, in 2015, the data broker market alone amassed USD 156 billion from selling data that
does not belong to them.

Having visibility and understanding of accurate data is vital to identify problems and
opportunities across the food value chain. HARA facilitates implementation of precision
agriculture using a suite of applications that combines data from IoT and satellite as well as from
third parties such as farmers, input suppliers, logistics, traders, retailers, governments, and other
entities. Data collected will provide actionable data-driven insights to support results in improved
productivity and efficiency in the agriculture and food sector. HARA is a solution to connect
farms, markets, consumers, and other stakeholders that supports the efforts to ensure food
security and secure solid economic growth for all.

Crop and Livestock Farmers
Farmers in developing countries are mainly smallholders or farm households that own/cultivate
a plot of land of less than 2 hectares. The vast majority of smallholder farms are located in rural
areas, especially on the continents of Asia and Africa. As a group, they earn at or below the
poverty levels in their home countries, typically earning less than $2.00 per day. These farmers
generally have minimal access to modern farming techniques, agricultural data, and access to
market information.

Off-takers and Traders
Off-takers and traders are those who purchase agricultural products directly from the farmers.
Off-takers invest on the farmers and agree to purchase farmers’ future production. One of the
biggest risks for off-takers is failing to recover cost of their investment because farmers sell some or
most of their increased productivity to other buyers, or also known as side selling.

Data Providers
Data providers include individual data contributors, data companies,
cooperatives, NGOs, field agents, and governments. They can use the data
exchange to assess the quality of their data and monetize it by exchanging
it for tokens.
Data Qualifiers
Data qualifiers add value to the ecosystem by providing verification in the
form of proof of work. They acts as a crowd-sourced indicator of data quality,
which overtime, will help improve the overall robustness of the data and
help generate healthy, ongoing demand. Data qualifiers will receive tokens
based on their efforts related to the tasks they perform in verifying data on the
exchange. Data qualifiers can be any HARA token holders.
Data Buyers
Data buyers include enterprises such as banks, insurance companies, retailers,
agriculture input suppliers, NGOs, and government - all the way down to local
communities or even individuals.
Value-added Services
Companies and institutions that access and process raw data from HARA
Ecosystem, and resubmit it as ‘enriched data’. These can be academic
institutions, brands, data analytics, financial technology and agriculture
technology companies. They create value-added insights from the raw data
and share in the proceeds with the original data providers by submitting the
cleansed, organized, and structured data back to the HARA Ecosystem.

A native token in the HARA ecosystem is required in order to encompass the inner economy and
protects it from those with large stakes of ETH and interests that are alien to the system. Similar to
how arcades prefer to use pre-paid cards or proprietary physical tokens, without a native token,
it would be difficult to manage the ecosystem at large. It is important to note that HARA token is
issued as a pure utility token and does not represent any form of security under Singapore law,
rules, and regulations.
Smallholder Farmer as any Data Provider
Smallholder farmers use the HARA platform with the expectation of receiving multiple benefits
from the various value-added providers in the ecosystem. By being a part of HARA, they gain
access to many benefits including, but not limited to:
y  Access to precision farming advice catered specifically to their farm to help them produce
greater yields per hectare accompanied with instructions and guidance
y  Recommendations regarding the best farm inputs - crop types, seed types, fertilizers, pest
controls, irrigation and more that are specific to each farmer’s location and environment
y  Access to market information specific to each farm including: local supply chain partners,
post-harvest off-takers, traders, and wholesalers
y  The farmer uploads certified land title document and other associated data that may be
leveraged to receive loans and other financial services
y  Access to other non-banking financial services such as crop/health/life insurance
y  Access to market data related to supply and demand levels and local market prices for
each type of crop
y  Ability to earn loyalty points that can be redeemed for a variety of goods and services
provided by HARA partners
The following diagram illustrates the flow a farmer will follow to add data to his account and
other inputs such as GPS data, crop planting suggestions, pest data and other information
associated with their farming practice.

Given the inherent challenges of training farmers to submit data, HARA is employing field officers
to assists farmers in registering their profiles and continuously collecting agriculture data throughout
the farming cycle of cultivation, harvest and post-harvest seasons. Smart contracts award tokens
to these data providers in the form of loyalty points, and the farmers can collect incentives (such as
discounts on fertilizers and seeds) through local partners also in the HARA ecosystem.
AgriTech or IoT Companies as any Data Provider
Businesses operating in the realm of agriculture, food, supply-chain and technology industries are
rewarded in the HARA ecosystem for sharing their data sets on the exchange. The HARA suite
of applications include a variety of apps for companies to upload data onto the HARA data
exchange platform. To simplify the token acquisition process, we are providing an entity called a
‘Network Operator’, which maintains a reserve of HARA tokens. When data is transacted, these
companies will receive proceeds in the form of tokens and can choose to convert them into
local currency using a network operator.

Data providers have to use HARA Token to be listed on the exchange. A portion of those tokens
is allocated to receive a basic rating and compensate for the work that goes into validating their
data. Data providers that get their data qualified by more qualifiers will receive higher ratings,
which will increase credibility compared to other data sets listed on the HARA decentralized
data exchange.

Data Buyer - Purchase Raw Data Sets
In this scenario, a company, NGO, government institution, or even an individual can contribute
tokens to get access to raw data sets from HARA. These data buyers will input a search query
using parameters and filters provided in the HARA ecosystem, initially concentrated around
agriculture and food sector data. When buyers access data, they can do so directly with tokens
or go through a network operator using local currency. The network operator will find the best
exchange price and make the transaction seamless for the buyer.

In addition to accessing data on the platform, HARA is adding a data seeking program feature
for data that is not yet available. Any data buyers can request and fund the acquisition of
highly specific granular data that is not yet available in the platform in the form of a ‘mini
tasks’. Data providers are crowd-sourced and incentivized to provide the requested data.
Through this feature, these ‘mini tasks’ can be pushed out to users and targetted based on GPS,
demographic segmentation (e.g. age, gender, location), time, and so forth.
HARA also integrates a customized marketing platform where data buyers can directly offer
their services, such as loans/insurance applications and general advertisements, with basic opt-
in and subscription functionality directly within the HARA application. For example, insurance
companies can now automatically target people based on a set of criteria - effectively creating
leads in an ongoing manner.

Value-Added Services: Data Buyers Enriching Data
HARA is empowering data sharing in this collaborative ecosystem through the formation of an
“enriched data” category. This allows data buyers to re-submit data they have accessed in
a cleansed, analyzed and more processed format providing value-added ready-to-use data
to other buyers. For example, a company may choose to use agriculture data set to produce
seasonal harvest reports for companies to estimate the yield of a particular crop. The proceeds
of these data sets will trickle back down to the original data providers.

Data Qualifiers: Improving Data Quality
HARA is implementing a qualification mechanism to drive the accurate rating of data. Any
data submitted on the exchange must earn a minimum basic rating before any exchange
can occur. This adds a secondary level of information aggregation to allow for dynamic
forecasting. Data providers can allocate more token in order to drive more qualifications,
thereby increasing its rating.
Data qualification method will be gamified in various ways, such as:
• Swiping for image recognition or confirmation
• Providing photographic proof of requested items
• Answering questions related to the data
In addition, part of a data qualifier’s rating comes from qualifying other data qualifiers in order to
ensure high quality data is being submitted. The tokens for rating qualifiers are initially taken from
HARA seeding fund then funded by portion of the proceeds from the ongoing transactions. This
acts as a self-regulating mechanism to ensure that data qualifiers are providing accurate data
and to avoid data qualifiers gaming the system. The rating that data qualifiers received enables
them to have access to better tiers of mini tasks and automatically increase their credibility.

Staking
In order to maintain their accounts and get access to the platform, stakeholders (data buyers,
value-added services, data providers, and data qualifiers) need to have a minimum staked
balance. The minimum balance allows them to receive push notifications on any activities in the
platform. Each notification will reduce their staked token balance.
Notifications can be customized to allow stakeholders to choose what they want to receive,
including: relevant bounties, solicitations, and data set updates. Once the staking balance is
below the minimum level, the account goes dormant. The account will be given a grace period
and then ultimately will be frozen if no more activity is recorded. This allows the platform to
differentiate between active and dormant accounts.

Blockchain Technology
Blockchain is an immutable, transparent, public and append-only ledger. A peer-to-peer
network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verifies those updates in a way that it is
impossible to fraud or to alter data.
HARA Data Exchange Platform uses Ethereum to create smart contracts, trace and validate
transactions and ownership rights, perform transactions through HARA tokens, and enable tokens
to be traded on third-party token exchanges. Through smart contracts, we can optimize our
activities. Currently, we are developing five categories of smart contracts:
yy                                                                                                     Data acquisition: Enables access control and data connection to supplementary data. It
allows for automatic data generation and enrichment.
yy                                                                                                     Data traceability: Enables tracking the origin of data, who owns and use it.

Private (Permissioned) Ethereum Network
The decision to use Ethereum is because HARA is a running project that needs to be
implemented fast using a proven technology. Ethereum has the biggest dApps projects and
connection support to other layers through Oraclize, Infura, and so forth. It also has the most
robust community and developer support while not closing the door entirely to other blockchain
technology along the way. That is why HARA is also exploring research and development
partnerships with other blockchain technology companies.
Inter Planetary File System (IPFS)
IPFS is a distributed file system protocol to connect all computing devices with the same system
of files. IPFS is a versioned file system that can access, manage and store files. It can also track
versions over time. IPFS also accounts for how those files move across the network, as it is also a
distributed file system.
Infura
Use of Infura APIs and developer tools provide secure, reliable, and scalable access to Ethereum
and IPFS. Infura enables HARA Data Exchange Platform to access IPFS seamlessly without the
hassle of managing the infrastructure.

Oraclize
Oraclize is a data carrier for decentralized apps. As data carrier, it provides a reliable connection
between Web APIs and HARA’s App using enforced cryptographic proofs. It eliminates the need
to open additional trust lines.
Bluzelle
A decentralized, on-demand, scalable database service for HARA data-exchange developers.
GDPR and PDPA Data Compliance
Blockchain technology enables decentralized data transaction that serves as a major basis
for compliance of data protection. The platform generally fulfills Singapore’s Personal Data
Protection Act (PDPA) and Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements
concerning privacy and protection of personal data. Following are the provisions in the HARA
data exchange platform to adhere to the obligations:
Consent
Data providers agree to consent for storing personal data in an encrypted format. They can
decide whether or not they consent to allow data buyers accessing their data.
In the HARA data exchange platform, document encryption is realized through the use of AES-
256 algorithm in producing an encryption key. The encryption key is further broken down into
several keys known as secret keys. The secret keys are distributed amongst data provider’s
wallet, HARA system and trusted third-party (e.g. government, value-added service providers). To
decrypt the data, the minimum of three keys is required. Any party (other than the data provider)
that possesses the key cannot decrypt the data without the consent of other key holders.
Purpose Limitation
Data buyers must inform data providers of the purpose of data set usage, which will be stated
and mutually agreed upon purchase agreement.
Notification
Data providers are notified whenever data buyers want to access their data. This is realized
through document provider smart contract that grants access permission to any stored data.
When data buyers want to access data, the system notifies the owner of the data or data
provider via blockchain. The blockchain verifies data availability using the proof of existence
smart contract.
Access and Correction
Data providers have full ownerships of their data sets. They have full access and control to
create, edit and modify the data. HARA only provides the access information in this ecosystem.
Accuracy
Every effort is made to ensure accurate personal data is collected. For example, in the case of
farmer as data provider, field officers are assigned to assist farmer in verifying, uploading and
maintaining data in the HARA application.
Additionally, the HARA data exchange platform provides a data qualification mechanism that
is supported by data rating features to evaluate data sets based on input such as historical
transactions, and buyer feedback and connected data points.

Protection
Data is securely stored and processed in the HARA data exchange platform. A combination of
IPFS permanent web, Bluezelle protocols, and Amazon web services (S3 and Dynamo DB) will be
implemented as data storage systems off the chain.
Proof of existence smart contract is deployed in the blockchain to ensure data is tamper-proof
and uncompromised. Every data is signed with fingerprint-like proof. If the data is changed, then
the associated fingerprint will also change. To verify the data, the fingerprint must match or it is
considered as tampered. Nevertheless, data providers should also ensure that a safe and reliable
data storage and accessible mechanism is maintained.
Retention
Data providers have full control on when the data is made accessible and can set the period to
allow data access.
Breach Notification
The appointed data protection officer will notify to supervisory authorities and stakeholders (data
providers, data buyers and value-added service providers) of any breach of data with high
priority and without any undue delay.
Data Erasure
HARA data exchange supports the rights to rectification and erasure. Data providers are in
absolute control of their data sets. When an account is deleted in the platform, private keys will
be destroyed, implying loss of corresponding and encrypted data.
Privacy by Design
The platform architecture ensures:
• Data providers own the personal data and have full control over it.
• Personal data is always encrypted and data providers hold the key to decrypt it.
• Transaction of personal data in the ecosystem is carried out with explicit permission and
consent from data provider. Data provider also understands how the data set is used and for
what purpose.
• Personal data transactions are fully transparent and traceable on the blockchain and
anonymity of trading parties is completely protected.

Dattabot, as a leading big data company in Indonesia, has been successfully providing access
to data and bring valuable insights across industries since its establishment in 2003. With our
experience in combining AI and blockchain technology, we believe it is now the time to pursue
the next phase of our mission: data democratization for the world’s most socially impactful
sectors. We began with the agriculture and food sector because we believe we should start at
the bottom of the pyramid and touch the largest, yet the most likely to suffer from economic and
informational inequalities. If we agree that the agriculture and food sector is the foundation of
how we can alleviate poverty and bring economic and social benefits to many, then this is where
we need to start.
Rapid growth of the world population has made food security a critical issue in the near future.
The challenge is not only to increase production but also to reduce productivity loss that counts
almost 30% across the value chain. We believe that near-time valuable data are crucial for the
agriculture and food sector to become more productive, inclusive, and resilient. To address this
challenge, we are developing HARA as the first end-to-end solution for all stakeholders in the
data exchange market and starting with agriculture and food sector value chain. The greater
the access to valuable agriculture data, the more applications of the data that people will find.
Furthermore, it is only the beginning. The HARA Data Exchange Platform will expand to the value
chains of health, transportation, education, and recreation sectors to amplify the impact of HARA
tokens to larger population.
The challenge now is to encourage adaptation and implementation of HARA Data Exchange
Platform as impactful and as universal as possible. Contributing tokens to HARA platform will
create opportunities to transform the lives of others.
Together, we can empower billions, one byte at a time.

Regulatory risks. The regulation of tokens such as HARA Tokens is still in a very nascent stage of
development in Singapore. A high degree of uncertainty as to how tokens and token-related
activities are to be treated exists. The applicable legal and regulatory framework may change
subsequent to the date of issuance of this White Paper. Such change may be very rapid and it is
not possible to anticipate with any degree of certainty the nature of such regulatory evolution.
HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD does not in any way represent that the regulatory status of HARA
Tokens will remain unaffected by any regulatory changes that arise at any point in time before,
during, and after this offering.
No regulatory supervision. None of HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD or its affiliates is currently
regulated or subject to the supervision of any regulatory body in Singapore. In particular, HARA
TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD and its affiliates are not registered with MAS in Singapore as any type of
regulated financial institution or financial advisor and are not subject to the standards imposed
upon such persons under the Securities and Futures Act, Financial Advisors Act, and other related
regulatory instruments. Such persons are required to comply with a variety of requirements and
standards concerning disclosures, reporting, compliance, and conduct of their operations for
purposes or maximizing investor protections. Since HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD is not subject to
such requirements or standards, it will make decisions on those issues at its own discretion. While
HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD will have regard to best practices on these issues, holders of HARA
Tokens will not necessarily enjoy the same extent and degree of investor protections as would be
the case should they purchase products or services from regulated entities instead.
Regulation from jurisdictions other than Singapore. The regulatory risks described herein
take into consideration Singapore law only. If it is anticipated that HARA Tokens will be sold or
resold outside Singapore, this would subject HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD or your HARA Tokens to
non-Singapore legal requirements. These legal requirements may be significant. Non-Singapore
regulation could involve the same types of changes and outcomes described above with
respect to Singapore regulation, and may negatively affect the value of HARA Tokens or cause
HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD to cease operations.
No fiduciary duties owed. As HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD is not a regulated financial
institution, it does not owe investors in HARA Tokens any fiduciary duties. This means that HARA
TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD has no legal obligation to always act in good faith in the best interests
of holders of HARA Tokens. While HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD will have regard to the interests
of holders of HARA Tokens, it is also permitted to consider the interests of other key stakeholders
and to prefer these interests over the interests of HARA Token holders. This may mean that HARA
TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD is permitted to make decisions that conflict with, or are not necessarily in,
the interests of HARA Tokens holders. Not owing any fiduciary duties to holders of HARA Tokens
also means that holders of HARA Tokens may have limited rights of recourse against HARA
TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD and its affiliates in the event of disputes.
Tax risks. The tax characterization of HARA Tokens is unclear. Accordingly, the tax treatment
to which they will be subject is uncertain. All persons who wish to purchase HARA Tokens should
seek independent tax advice prior to deciding whether to purchase any HARA Tokens. HARA
TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD does not make any representation as to whether any tax consequences
may arise from purchasing or holding HARA Tokens.

Risks from third parties. The tokenized nature of HARA Tokens means that they are a
blockchain-based asset. The security, transferability, storage, and accessibility of blockchain
assets depends on factors outside of HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD’s control, such as the security,
stability, and suitability of the underlying blockchain (in this case, the [Ethereum] blockchain),
mining disruptions, and who has access to the private key of any wallet where HARA Tokens are
stored. HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD does not represent or otherwise assure that it can prevent
such external factors from having any direct or indirect adverse impact on any of HARA Tokens.
Persons intending to purchase HARA Tokens should note that adverse events caused by such
external factors may results in the loss of some or all HARA Tokens purchased. Such loss may be
irreversible. HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD is not responsible for taking steps to retrieve HARA Tokens
lost in this manner.
Risks of purchasing HARA Tokens. HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD cannot and does not
guarantee or otherwise assure that there are no risks in relation to your purchase of HARA Tokens.
The purchase of HARA Tokens may, depending on the manner in which the relevant purchase
is effected, involve third parties or external platforms (e.g., wallets). The involvement of such
parties or platforms may introduce risks that would not otherwise be present, such as misconduct
or fraud by the third party, or your failure to receive HARA Tokens upon duly making payment
because of a third-party wallet’s incompatibility with HARA Tokens. HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD
is not responsible for any risks arising due to the involvement of third parties, including the risk of
not receiving (or subsequently losing) any or all HARA Tokens you attempt to (or successfully)
purchase.
Vulnerability to cyberattacks. The platform and Services are available for use in part by
leveraging on distributed computing and storage resources available through wide area network
connections (the “Cloud”). As a result, the Services are susceptible to a number of risks related
to Cloud-based computing and data storage. While HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD does not have
access to the encrypted contents of the data stored through the Services, the Services may
involve the storage of large amounts of sensitive and/or proprietary information, which may be
compromised in the event of a cyberattack or other malicious activity. Similarly, the Services may
be interrupted and files may become temporarily unavailable in the event of such an attack or
malicious activity. Because users can use a variety of hardware and software that may interface
with the platform, there is the risk that the Services may become unavailable or interrupted
based on a failure of interoperability or an inability to integrate these third-party systems and
devices that HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD does not control with HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD’s
Services. The risk that the Services may face increasing interruptions and the platform may face
additional security vulnerabilities could adversely affect the platform and, therefore, the future
value and utility of your HARA Tokens.
Vulnerability to mining attacks. As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on
the [Ethereum] protocol, your HARA Tokens are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of
validating the Token transactions on the [Ethereum] blockchain. Such attacks include double-
spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks, among others. Any
successful attack presents a risk to your HARA Tokens and the platform, including, but not limited
to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving your HARA Tokens.
Disruption in operations. Technical difficulties may affect HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD or its
affiliates. Such disruptions may prevent your access to or use of HARA Tokens or the platform.
While HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD   will take all reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the
impact of such disruptions on its provision of services and its operations in general, there can be
no guarantee that all such disruptions may be successfully prevented.

No guarantee of value of HARA Tokens. There is no guarantee that your HARA Tokens will hold
their value or increase in value. You may lose the entire, or part of the, amount of any payment
you made for HARA Tokens. If you are financing your purchase of HARA Tokens and the value of
your HARA Tokens decreases, you may be unable to repay the loan used to purchase your HARA
Tokens. There is considerable uncertainty about their long-term viability, which could be affected
by a variety of factors, including market-based factors such as economic growth. In addition, the
success of your HARA Tokens will depend on whether blockchain and other new technologies
related to your HARA Tokens turn out to be useful and economically viable. HARA TECHNOLOGY
PTE LTD does not control any of these factors, and therefore may not be able to control the long-
term success of your HARA Tokens as a feature of the platform, or the ability of your HARA Tokens
to maintain their value. HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD provides no guarantee that the amount of
your HARA Tokens you purchase will retain their value. You may lose all or some of that value. HARA
TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD does not plan to maintain any type of bond or trust account designed to
protect holders of your HARA Tokens. Even if HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD did so, you should be
aware that any bond or trust account maintained by HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD for the benefit
of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by holders of HARA Tokens.
Volatility of HARA Tokens. The volatility and unpredictability of the price of HARA Tokens relative
to other virtual and fiat currencies may result in significant loss over a short period of time. Although
HARA Tokens cannot be purchased with fiat currency, the value of the cryptocurrencies that may
be used to purchase HARA Tokens can be. As a result, the value of HARA Tokens may in part be
affected by or derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat
currency for cryptocurrencies. Changes in such currencies relative to each other as well as to fiat
currencies may accordingly affect the price and, in turn, the value of HARA Tokens.
Level of demand for HARA Tokens not assured or constant. It is possible that there will be
minimal to no demand for your HARA Tokens. In such an event, the short-term and long-term
viability of your HARA Tokens and the platform will be in doubt, and HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE
LTD may terminate your HARA Tokens and cease all operations. Moreover, the cryptocurrency
market is a new and untested market, the characteristics and behavior of which, in the context
of domestic and global markets, is not fully understood. The level of demand for HARA Tokens
cannot be accurately predicted or projected.
Use and continued acceptance of HARA Tokens. Although HARA Tokens may be accepted
as payment at any point in time, there is no assurance that HARA Tokens will still be accepted as
payment (or as a medium of exchange) at any subsequent point in time.
Risks in holding HARA Tokens. If you store your HARA Tokens in a hot wallet or certain types
of cold wallets, your HARA Tokens balance will be associated with the public key address of
your wallet and, in turn, your private key address. You are responsible for knowing your private
key address and keeping it a secret. Because a private key, or a combination of private keys, is
necessary to control and dispose of HARA Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault, the loss of
one or more of your private keys associated with your digital wallet or vault storing HARA Tokens
will result in the loss of your HARA Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to one or
more of your private keys, including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet
service you use, may be able to misappropriate your HARA Tokens. HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD
and its affiliates will never ask you for your private key address, and you should never share this
information with someone you do not know and trust.

Reversal of transactions. Transactions of HARA Tokens may be irreversible. This includes
transactions made fraudulently, erroneously, or accidentally. HARA Tokens involved in such
irreversible transactions may not be recoverable. HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD does not
anticipate that it will redeem HARA Tokens from holders of HARA Tokens for any reason.
Token supply. The supply of HARA Tokens may decrease for various reasons, including reasons
outlined in this section on risk factors. In addition, if a wallet is lost, HARA Tokens stored therein
may not reenter the Token supply. Alternatively, HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD may burn any
number of HARA Tokens. Burning HARA Tokens will destroy the HARA Tokens and reduce the
overall HARA Tokens supply. The supply of HARA Tokens may increase should HARA TECHNOLOGY
PTE LTD decide, after having issued and distributed the maximum number of HARA Tokens in its
initial token offering, to have one or more token generation events.
Subsequent sale and exchange. HARA Tokens may be sold on exchanges or directly between
parties after the close of the initial token offering for fiat or other cryptocurrencies. However,
there is no guarantee that such a secondary market will develop or that mechanisms for such
secondary trading will develop or be available at any given time. HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD is
not involved in operating these exchanges and is not responsible for encouraging them or any
other person to transact in HARA Tokens. It should additionally be noted that cryptocurrency
exchanges may be newly established and subject to little or no regulatory supervision and, as
a consequence, more vulnerable to attacks, fraud, or manipulation. Fluctuations in the value
ascribed to HARA Tokens on any cryptocurrency exchange may affect the value of HARA Tokens
on other cryptocurrency exchanges. Regulatory restrictions may apply on the resale of HARA
Tokens, whether under Singapore law or the law of any other jurisdiction.
No assured use of HARA Tokens on platforms other than the platform. HARA Tokens are
designed for use on the platform. Although third parties may also build systems that also allow
the use of HARA Tokens, HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD does not anticipate any involvement in
those uses of HARA Tokens and has no responsibility for them. There is no guarantee that any third
parties will develop alternative uses of your HARA Tokens.
No participation in operations. Holding HARA Tokens does not confer any right to vote on, be
consulted about, or have a say in (i) any aspect of HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD’s management
or (ii) how the platform is administered, developed, or governed. As a result, HARA Token holders
will not have control over the platform or HARA Tokens and may not prevent or prohibit HARA
TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD from making decisions that may adversely affect the platform or HARA Tokens.
Cessation of operations. There is no guarantee that HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD or any of its
affiliates will continue as viable companies. The utility and value of HARA Tokens depend on
HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD’s success and support of the platform. If HARA TECHNOLOGY PTE LTD
ceases operations and goes out of business, you may lose 100% of the value of your HARA Tokens.
