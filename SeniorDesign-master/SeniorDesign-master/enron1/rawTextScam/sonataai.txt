2. The Vision
In the past few years, the cryptocurrency market has been constantly growing. It has become a
multibillion-dollar industry, appealing for investors who see it as a platform for making quick
money. The sudden popularity of investing in new coins and tokens was undoubtedly inspired by
stories of young millionaires who invested in Bitcoin back in the time when only few people
believed this technology would be successful.
The vision of effortless income has attracted some expert investors, but also large numbers of
inexperienced enthusiasts. A common weakness of these novice investors is that they are not
familiar with how cryptocurrencies work since they are usually not interested in the underlying
technology of blockchain. Moreover, as opposed to seasoned professional brokers, these new
investors typically lack the knowledge of basic stock exchange principles.
However, these newcomers are the driving force behind the quickly growing market, fueling the
largest share of the industry. Their number is steadily growing as the public awareness of
cryptocurrencies and their benefits spreads across the globe.
Our experience
When we first decided to invest in cryptocurrencies ourselves, we naturally started using several
different existing exchanges, because there was not a single one that would satisfy our needs.
We have soon found out, that as technology enthusiasts, we were deeply dissatisfied with the
state of the cryptocurrency market. That is why we decided to do something about it.
We approached other users to ask them about their experience. Many of them shared our views
on the unsatisfactory situation of cryptocurrency exchanges. We have heard most of those
complaints over and over. Let us summarize the most frequent deficiencies and concerns:
There is a huge need for a stable and secure cryptocurrency exchange system. Even the
biggest players have stability issues, therefore their applications are not completely
reliable. This is not acceptable in the trading world, where every millisecond can be
worth a large sum of money.
To the big surprise of users, most cryptocurrency exchanges lack many functionalities of
established exchange systems (Forex, commodities, etc.) that have been used for many
years.
The vast majority of cryptocurrency exchanges do not provide an easy-to-use trading
from charts, a tool that has been used by traditional exchanges for many years.
Sonata.ai                                                                                           6




Even the biggest exchanges offer only few of the most common coins and tokens.
Most exchanges impose restrictive daily and monthly transaction limits. The registration
process is too lengthy. The whole registration process can take up to three months,
during this time, investors can miss many opportunities.
The user interface is usually too complex for basic operations, with too much emphasis
on tools that are unimportant and not often used. Many common tools do not function
as would be expected and leave even the expert traders confused, let alone the
beginners.
These issues make the users search for more than one exchange, force them to work with more
products at once and cause unnecessary inconvenience. It seems that also expert users are
missing one exchange that would contain all the basic features and “do them right”.
Sonata.ai                                                                                     7




3. Introduction
We are aware that it is challenging to succeed as a new project in a saturated market. However,
the fact that Sonata is not the first cryptocurrency exchange on the market is actually one of its
advantages. This allows us to evaluate several established projects and the usability of their
features. Unlike the leading exchange platforms, Sonata does not have to alter an already
operational product and force users to acquire new usage patterns. Currently, we are gathering
feedback from users in the field and fine-tuning our platform before the actual launch.
Right from the start we are building an exchange with the expectation of large trading volumes,
so the whole solution is based on a scalable microservices architecture.
The motto of our company is to maintain continuous technological and functional development
of the product. Our goal is to create a balanced, easy-to-use product that would be suitable for
entry-level users, while also providing all the advanced features required by experienced
investors.
Backed by a strong investor
The main investor of Sonata is the company Solidní Finance, a.s., a company that has been active
in the investment market since 1994. Solidní Finance, a.s. provides all the financial resources
needed for the completion of our project. Thanks to a strong financial support of this company,
Sonata’s project development team can fully concentrate on the creation of a high-quality
product. Therefore, the ICO can be used as a marketing campaign, rather than a way of
gathering necessary financial resources.
Solidní Finance
Solidní Finance, a.s. cooperates with brokers and stock brokers who are helping the team with
user experience testing and they are providing advisory services in processes “behind the
curtain”. Thanks to these experts with rich experience in the field and also thanks to the
technical knowledge of our implementation team, Sonata is a project that will have a strong
position on the multibillion cryptocurrency market.
Sonata.ai                                                                                            8




4. The Market
The crypto market is without a doubt one of the fastest growing new markets in modern history.
Its total market cap fluctuates around $200,000,000,000 1 , with daily exchange volume at over
$10,000,000,0002  and is steadily growing.
Most of the market analysts agree that the field is still in its infancy and expect that it will
become more stable as cryptocurrencies will become globally accepted as a means of trade in
the future. Gradual regulation in many countries points to the fact that cryptocurrencies are
being taken seriously even at the top governmental levels.
That said, only small percentage of potential investors and traders are currently taking part in
cryptocurrency exchange. As the market is grows, we can clearly see a rising interest of investors
emerging from the general public. Their interest can be attributed to somewhat hyped media
coverage of this topic. It is surprisingly not diminishing, even though the government
restrictions and stagnant a Q2 and Q3 of 2018 would indicate the contrary. We expect steady
and strong interest in investments in this field, be it cryptocurrencies or blockchain as such.
Market analysis
It is almost impossible to find out how many people trade cryptocurrencies and how often they
actually trade them. The reasons are following:
Users can have more than one wallet. They usually have wallets for different services,
cryptocurrencies, and for different activities: payment, holding, exchange etc.
Users of exchanges can have many smaller virtual wallets for every platform, possibly
even one wallet for every transaction.
The only way to effectively count the number of cryptocurrency users is an approximation.
According to available data, currently over 28,000,000 wallets were created using the blockchain
network 3. To compare this number: at the beginning of the year 2017, only approx. 10,000,000
wallets existed. We can easily see the sharp increase in the number of wallets within the last two
years. However, to make our estimation relevant, we see the 28,000,000 wallets as a upper limit
for our calculations.

Target group
As we already pointed out in Introduction of this white paper, Sonata is aiming at the large and
steadily growing group of novice investors as the main target group. To specify the target group,
let’s sum up some of the main traits of a potential user:
A new user, who is searching for the best business opportunity and needs the help of a
community of professionals.
An experienced user searching for a better trading platform to replace his current
exchange.
The owner of a larger amount of cryptocurrencies, searching for a safe way to multiply
his holdings via high interest P2P loans.
A holder, who wants to gain passive income from the transaction fees Sonata will divide
between investors.
An exchange specialist, who knows how to maximize his earnings using a few different
exchange platforms.
Strategy providers and asset managers, who manage asset portfolios of their clients.
These user personas can and in most cases will mingle into more complex groups. That allows
us to reach our audience with a wider variety of marketing tools, as their online presence in
different channels overlaps.

5. The Product
Security
The main concern of any rationally thinking investor must be the safety of a given service.
Questions like “Is it safe to entrust my money to the platform owners?” or “Can I trust the
expertise of the creators?” are perfectly understandable. That is why we have built our exchange
with the mindset, "security first". We provide multiple security layers, including unmatched
server-side security, hardware wallet storage and premium protection against phishing and
DDoS attacks. We have learned from the best and will secure your investment no matter what.
We are still in process of testing all possible security measures, but we have already created a
basic set of rules for the exchange. The set includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Strict internal security processes, risk and vulnerability management
Certified data center that meets the highest security standards - ISO 27001, SOC 1 and
SOC 2/SSAE 16/ISAE 3402, PCI Level 1, Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), FISMA Moderate
Port scanning
An isolated database environment
Individual microservices, communication via an encrypted protocol
90%+ test coverage
Regular test-first updates of all used dependencies
Secure communication over IPsec (Internet Protocol security)
SQL injection protection
EV SSL certificate
SSL/HTTPS + HSTS
Cross-site scripting protection (XSS)
Cross-site request forgery protection (CSRF)
High efficiency DDoS protection
Sonata.ai                                                                                          11




Spoofing and sniffing protection
IP address blacklist
Strong password policy with two-factor authentication (SMS verification, Google
Authenticator)
All passwords and keys will be stored using modern hashes (Argon2i, bcrypt, scrypt or
PBKDF2)
Cryptography - we do not use MD5, SHA-2 or similar hash functions that could mean
potential security vulnerability of the system. All sensitive data will be encrypted using
AES-256 encryption.
Private keys stored on multiple cryptocurrency wallets. The wallets will be
geographically separate, so that compromise of one wallet will not endanger all keys.
Transaction fees
Although it may seem counterintuitive, we will offer lower fees than most of the competition.
Our fees will probably not be the lowest, but we will maintain them at a competitive level. It is
obvious that the SONT token holders would prefer the highest possible fees. We believe that it is
crucial to attract large group of traders who will actually use the exchange and provide high
liquidity, thus attracting more users to join. Fees are one of the criteria certain users will build
their decision on, especially on the entry level.
Finding the “sweet spot” between low fees for the active users and rewarding payments for the
token holders is one of the challenges Sonata has to solve continuously.
You can find the expected fees for the transaction and withdrawal below:

BTC, LTC, ETH                                                                                          0%
Currency                                                                                               Maker / Taker fee
BTC, LTC, ETH                                                                                          0.09% / 0.19% (decreases with volume)
Currency                                                                                               Withdrawal fee
BTC, LTC, ETH                                                                                          Varies by currency and volume
Sonata.ai                                                                                                                                      12




We are planning to add other coins and tokens based on the volume trading and internal audit,
so the system liquidity is ensured. We are expecting listing the major cryptocurrencies (Tether,
EOS and Bitcoin CASH) in the first wave. Newly added assets will be announced in advance
before they appear on Sonata.
User Interface
The best interface is no interface.
We conducted in-depth interviews with exchange experts and the results have shown that every
user has different needs and likes different things when it comes to the user interface.
Therefore, we decided to make our default interface based on the most common usage
patterns. Our designers have spent hours analyzing the user experience of professional brokers
to build a truly distraction free interface. We aim to fulfill the needs of the majority of users.
However, we plan an addition of customizable user interface to suit the needs of all of our
clients.

Margin trading
Margin (also leverage) trading is an
expert tool used to level up the order
income. On the other hand, this highly
requested functionality can represent a
high-risk scenario for the lender and the
exchange if not “done right”. It is quite
difficult to master the right algorithm for
pairing the lender with the buyer and
that is one of the reasons, why the
feature is not as common as it might be.
We are aware that margin trading is
regulated or even restricted in certain
countries. The platform will allow
restriction of certain functions for
specific countries, thus effectively          Margin trade settings, Sonata exchange application
providing the needed flexibility.

All coins and tokens in one place
Some exchanges do not offer small tokens because these tokens have low liquidity and not
everyone is interested in buying them. However, there is a high demand for exchanges with a
wide portfolio of tokens of different values. That is why Sonata will offer the majority of
important tradeable tokens.
It is probable that we will add tokens and coins gradually/one by one, so not all of them will be
available at the launch of the first version. The key trading pairs included at the launch will be:
Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum (ETH).
AI algorithms predicting price trends
Sonata will use a real-time market data and advanced AI algorithm to predict future price trends.
We are confident to deliver a very precise prediction model built by artificial neural network
(Long short-term memory). The algorithm is consulted with AI experts who have already created
a working model of short-term prediction for gold spot price.
AI prediction can by no means be seen as the only instrument for informed investment
decisions, but it can be a very helpful starting tool for beginners in the field.

Bot-friendly API
Sonata will support all kinds of traders. Traders who prefer carefully planned long-term
strategies can take advantage of our bot-friendly, well documented API. You will be able to
customize your own notifications, trading orders, limits and much more.
Social elements
Interest in cryptocurrencies has connected highly specialized communities of professional and
semi- professional exchange brokers. We plan to foster and cultivate this community even
further. Sonata will feature group chats, categorized by topics, currencies etc. Real-time chat will
allow users to share their knowledge and experience, communicate with others, ask for help or
share a solution.
Yet another social mechanism is trader ranks. The profile of every trader will be distinctly
highlighted by a color and symbols based on their trade volume and success. This way the

Mobile apps
Sonata is not a single application, but a whole
ecosystem. Although we consider the web-based
application as its core, the mobile application is not
of any less importance. The mobile experience is a
carefully planned part of the overall user experience
and unlike what you might have seen in other cases,
it is not just a smaller version of the core
application. Our mobile apps will provide all the
basic features of the web exchange, portfolio
overview, current income from SONT and also
advanced notifications settings. Sonata will be
available as a native app, both for Android and iOS.

unlimited scalability for the future.
Most of the Sonata’s microservices are written in Go and fully test-covered. The programming
language Go, created by Google, is typical for its low latency, highly secure design and a high
level of standardization.
The administrative interface and part of the microservices of Sonata is built in Python’s popular
framework Django. Database is handled by Apache Kafka, a platform for distributed streaming.
Apache Kafka was created for real-time data logging and data pairing. It will be used together
with a time series database system InfluxDB to handle transactions, margin trading and fees
distribution. All other data will be securely stored within performance-oriented database
PostgreSQL.
The front end interface (content presented to a user) is written in React, the JavaScript library
used by global services for real-time data and content streaming (Facebook, Spotify, Twitch,
Instagram, Netflix etc.)
The main interface of every trader is a chart or set of charts. Sonata will build the interface using
Tradingview charts, a service widely used among other exchange platforms. These charts are
highly customizable and provide the flexible functionality for almost every use case.

6. Sonata Token (SONT)
Sonata token (SONT) is based on Ethereum blockchain system and is standard ERC20 compliant.
During the ICO period we will offer 250,000,000 tokens out of total 500,000,000. Sale will start
on October 8, 2018 and will be followed by strategic phases as illustrated in the chapter
“Roadmap” below.
Token sale
We plan to divide the token sale into several stages, rewarding early adopters with the highest
bonus rate. The token sale will not be limited by time, as is common for other ICOs, but by the
amount of tokens. Once the tokens are sold, there will be no other chance to buy them with the
given bonus. To keep the price of SONT steady, Sonata will lockout its tokens and will release
them in regulated quantities, always in a given period of time.

Plan of token trade
Plenty of ICOs made the mistake selling their tokens in a haste. Because of that, their token lost
a lot of its value, often dropping to fraction of its potential. Knowing that, we have prepared a
trading plan that will have strict annual limits and the real trade volume will react to the market
situation.
Sonata (both the team and the company) will not take part in sale of tokens the first year after
the ICO is over, and will not offer tokens under the subscription price of $0.1.
Below is the trade plan of the acquisition tokens:
Years after ICO                                                                                       Token limits

Second year                                                                                           15,000,000 SONT
Third year                                                                                            25,000,000 SONT
Fourth year                                                                                           30,000,000 SONT
Fifth year                                                                                            35,000,000 SONT
5-year distribution will be enforced by a smart contract.

Earnings estimates for token holders
Estimated payback period
Estimation of payback period is directly dependent on daily exchange volume of Sonata.

Income from margin trading
Margin trading is one of the basic tools of trade
of any exchange broker. Traders can borrow a
leveraged amount of money at market-driven
interest rates. This way they can invest more and
Loan interest
significantly increase their profits from their
investment. A smart automatic pairing and
closing algorithm will secure both sides of the
deal.
Traders pay loan fees both to the exchange and
the loaner. 80 % of portion of the interest                                                            80% to investors     20% to Sonata.ai

income paid to the exchange is distributed
among Sonata token holders every month.
Please, see the interactive chart on our webpage
to learn more about the potential revenue
available for token holders.
Additional tokens gained from fees
You can acquire SONT tokens in more ways than by cryptocurrency exchange during the ICO
stage of the project. We designed a mechanism that will guarantee that all active users of our
exchange platform can get SONT tokens for every transaction they make.
The amount of gained tokens will be calculated according to the value of the transaction. Tokens
will be distributed fairly. They will be credited to the user’s wallet as soon as the transaction is
completed. In total, we will distribute 5 % of all issued tokens, plus the tokens that would not be
sold in the ICO stage of the project.
Reward model
The token distribution mechanism is optimized to reward actively trading users. The estimation
of the payback period is based on the system of rewards for investors; to be more specific we
base this on daily exchange volume.
Example of rewards
A user trades 1 BTC. This trade will cost him 0.19% of the traded value. 50% of the paid fee will
be returned back to the user in SONT tokens. These tokens can be further sold or you can hold
them to increase your passive revenue. This way, users can de facto get back the value of
previously paid fees.

8. Marketing Strategy
Our marketing strategy focuses on online promotion of the application. In our advertisement,
we will clearly and transparently emphasize the advantages it has for the users. The campaign
will present the project, its mission and its global impact to a pre-defined group of users.
Mission of the project
When it comes to cryptocurrency trading and exchange, we strive for simplicity and efficiency.
We want to take part in education and in the development of blockchain technologies on a
global level. Our mission is to introduce cryptocurrencies to the general public, novice traders
and ecommerce companies that can also largely contribute to the development of
cryptocurrencies.
Strategic goal of the project
The main goal of this project is the development of a community formed around our exchange
application. A community of users who would trade together, communicate, share their
expertise and help each other. When we designed our platform, we focused on the effectiveness
of the trading process and on maximizing income with respect to the current situation on the
market.
Marketing channels
The project will be promoted on efficient communication channels that can be used to target a
specific audience. Below, you can find a list of the channels we will be using. The list is neither
exhaustive nor definitive.
Press release
A press release is a great way to inform the general public about the project and its
characteristics. Not only does it raise awareness of the project and the brand, but it also allows
us to measure the conversion rate of visitors from information websites.
Reach: up to 15 million users / month
Sonata.ai                                                                                             24




Guest articles and PR articles
Publishing guest articles on thematic websites is usually for free. This applies to smaller websites
with lower reach. High-traffic websites and media servers publish PR articles for a fixed fee.
Reach: up to 25 million users / month
PPC
PPC is one of the most complicated marketing methods when it comes to advertising crypto
products. This is even more true in comparison with the year 2017. Advertising ICO and other
crypto projects is currently banned on browsers and Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter
content networks. This has unfortunately reduced the efficiency of performance marketing.
However, there is still a large number of specialized websites, blogs and media that offer PPC
advertising or other forms of publicity with great potential.
Reach: depending on the budget, we estimate it could be up to 5 million users / month
Social networks and internet forums
This is one of the best ways to achieve significant reach within your target group
at a relatively low cost. There are hundreds of communities on social networks and these
communities have hundreds of thousands of members. The advantage is that they are usually
active members with a potential of long-term communication. Some of these channels offer paid
advertisement that is easily quantifiable.
Reach: 35 million users / month
Referral program
These commission programs are more and more popular, both with users who are rewarded if
their friends join the program, but also with bloggers, youtubers and other content creators.
Reach: 3 million users / month

9. Roadmap
Q2 2015
First cryptocurrency investments. We are searching for a single exchange platform that
would fulfil all our expectations. We fail to find one.
Q3 2015
We enjoy cryptocurrency trading and we see enormous potential in this branch. We are
thinking about ways to enter the cryptocurrency market with a new product.
Q4 2016
The idea is born: Sonata will become a cryptocurrency platform designed for exchange,
trading, P2P lending and maybe even more.
Q3 2017
We set up a team of designers, developers, marketers and specialists in the field of
exchange market analysis.
Q1 2018
We create a simple currency exchange aimed for the Czech market: SonataCoin.com.
There is a lot of potential for a new full-fledged exchange and the team agrees to start the
development of such a service.
Q2 2018
The team laid the groundwork for Sonata.ai. We have a chance to meet with partners and
advisers who are as enthusiastic about our idea as we are.
Q3 2018
The first internal version of the exchange. The AI for price prediction is consulted with AI
experts and we can see the first results of short-term predictions.
Q4 2018
The public sale of SONT tokens is launched. We strongly believe that the investment will
be beneficial for investors thanks to our smart payment mechanism. The mechanism pays
out 80 percent of trade fees back to holders.
