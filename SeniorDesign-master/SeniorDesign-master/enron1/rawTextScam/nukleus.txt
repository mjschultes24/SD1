OVERVIEW
There  is  a  growing  subset  of  cryptocurrencies  known  as
masternode  coins.  Masternode  coins  operate  similarly  to
Bitcoin  and  other  cryptocurrencies  but  with  one  notable
difference; they utilize masternodes as opposed to full nodes.
This  offers  a  range  of  functionality  not  provided  by  other
cryptocurrencies  including  instant  payments,  anonymous
transactions, and more.
As  a  reward  for  providing  these  valuable  services  to  the
network, masternode operators are compensated in the form
of block rewards, similar to cryptocurrency miners. For instance
with the masternode coin Dash masternode operators earn the
same reward as miners, or 45% of the total block reward.
While operating a masternode can be profitable and fulfilling
for venturing cryptocurrency supporters and enthusiasts there
are some challenges to getting started:
• Launching a masternode is a highly technical process and
goes beyond the scope of most users’ abilities.
• Launching a masternode requires a minimum holding, or
stake, of coins to get started. This stake can require 10’s
to 100’s of thousands of dollars.
2




The Nukleus platform solves the two big obstacles preventing
more users from launching masternodes:
• One-click masternode hosting allows users to launch a
masternode with incredible ease - no advanced technical
ability required.
• Masternode pools allow users to pool their masternode
coin holdings with other users to launch a masternode.
Now users with any amount of masternode coins can
enjoy the benefits of running a masternode.
We have an ambitious roadmap and development is underway.
The  Nukleus team  expects  to launch  our full-site including
masternode hosting in April 2018. By August 2018 we will have
completed our token sale and launched our first masternode
pools.  By  December  2018  we  plan  to  support  at  least  10
masternode coins for hosting and pool services.
The Nukleus platform relies on the Nukleus token (NUK) for
users to consume our services. There are 21B NUK in existence
of which 70% will be available via token sales. NUK will not be
subject to buy-backs, dividends, coin burning, or any other
means of passive appreciation.

INTRO TO MASTERNODES
Masternodes are a key component in the technology of a
growing   subset   of   cryptocurrencies.   To   understand
masternodes it helps to have a high level understanding of
cryptocurrencies in general.
CRYPTOCURRENCY TECHNOLOGY
The validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a
blockchain.  A  blockchain  is  a  continuously  growing  list  of
records,  called  blocks,  which  are  linked  and  secured  using
cryptography. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to
modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that
can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a
verifiable and permanent way".
For  use  as  a  distributed  ledger,  a  blockchain  is  typically
managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a
protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in
any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the
alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of
the network majority.1 2 3 4 5

cryptocurrency technologies: a comprehensive introduction. Princeton: Princeton University Press.

Here is a simple example of the Bitcoin network architecture:
You’ll note the role of the  “Full Node”, which is to receive
transactions from users and broadcast to the network.
NODES
Nodes job is to enforce the rules of a blockchain network. In the
case of Bitcoin nodes enforce rules such as:
• Blocks  may  only  create  a  certain  number  of  bitcoins.
(Currently 12.5 BTC per block)
• Transactions must have correct signatures for the bitcoins
being spent
• Transactions/blocks must be in the correct data format
• Within a single block chain, a transaction output cannot be
double-spent
3 "Blockchain". Investopedia. Archived from the original on 23 March 2016. "Based on the Bitcoin protocol, the
blockchain database is shared by all nodes participating in a system."
4 Iansiti, Marco; Lakhani, Karim R. (January 2017). "The Truth About Blockchain". Harvard Business Review. Harvard
University.
5 “Cryptocurrency”. Wikipedia. Retrieved on 28 January 2018.

If a transaction or block violates the rules, then it is absolutely
rejected, even if every other node on the network thinks that it
is valid. This is one of the most important characteristics of full
nodes - they do what's right no matter what.6
MASTERNODES
Like  full  nodes,  masternodes  are  a  series  of  servers  that
underpin a blockchain’s network.    They are responsible for
enabling specific services that miners under proof of work
cannot accomplish.
Popular masternode coins:
Dash                                                                  Pivx   Crown   Linda   Ionomy
Dash   was   the   first   cryptocurrency   to   implement   the
masternode model into its protocol.   Under what Dash calls its
proof  of  service  algorithm,  a  second  tier  network  of
masternodes exists alongside a first tier network of miners to
achieve distributed consensus on the blockchain.
6 “Full node”. Bitcoinwiki. Retrieved on 28 January 2018.

Masternodes expand the scope of functionality which exists on
other  networks  such  as  Bitcoin.  In  the  case  of  Dash,
masternodes provide the following:
• InstaSend:                                                                                       Masternodes   accommodate   nearly
instantaneous transactions
• PrivateSend: Masternodes allow for users to make and
receive anonymous payments
• Decentralized Governance: Masternodes adjudicate and
vote on technological and financial developments for the
blockchain
Building  off  Dash’s  success  new  cryptocurrencies  began  to
surface which took bits and pieces of Dash’s model, especially
masternode technology, for themselves.7
MASTERNODE REWARDS
Like Bitcoin, masternode coins rely on masternodes to ensure
the  security  and  stability  of  the  network.  Unlike  Bitcoin
however,  masternode  operators  are  compensated  for  their
efforts. Dash masternode operators receive 45% of the block
reward generated as each new block is mined, with miners
receiving the same for their efforts. Other masternode coins
are similarly configured.
7 Harper, Colin (December 2017). “What are Masternodes? An Introduction and Guide”. Coincentral.

With  Dash,  the  most  established  masternode  coin,  the
compensation   from   operating   a   masternode   nets   an
approximate  10% annual return. Other newer coins are less
expensive to get up and running and can provide a more
lucrative return for masternode operators, sometimes reaching
into the 100%+ range.

THE FUTURE OF BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM
Bitcoin   and   Ethereum,   the   two   most   widely   utilized
cryptocurrencies, have been struggling to scale with growing
user demand. Two of the most promising solutions for this
issue,  The  Lightning  Network  for  Bitcoin  and  The  Raiden
Network for Ethereum, are currently under development.
Interestingly, both the Bitcoin Lightning Network and Ethereum
Raiden Network utilize many principles already employed by
masternode networks. As a result these proposed networks
allow for many features masternode coins already provide,
including:
• Instant Transactions - No need for block confirmations
• Micropayments - Possible due to lower fees
• Scalability - Infinitely scalable off-chain transactions
If  these  solutions  deliver  as  advertised  there  is  a  good
possibility  that  running  a  Bitcoin  or  Ethereum  node,  like
masternodes today, will be a profitable venture. When these
technologies  arrive  Nukleus  will  provide  a  simple  solution
allowing anyone to profit from this new opportunity.

THE NUKLEUS PLATFORM
Masternode coins are a new breed of cryptocurrencies which
enhance the best elements of blockchain technology and offer
a  range  of  incremental  benefits  to  users  and  masternode
operators.
WHY RUN A MASTERNODE?
There are two key reasons to run a masternode:
SUPPORT A CRYPTO NETWORK
Many  cryptocurrency  enthusiasts  are  passionate  about  the
projects they support and some are willing to expend time and
resources to contribute to the network infrastructure. This is
best exemplified by Bitcoin, which offers no financial incentive
to operate nodes yet has many thousands currently online.
GENERATE FINANCIAL RETURN
Some masternode operators are strictly financially motivated.
They may switch between masternodes to generate the best
return possible. Other masternode operators are more passive,
often  being  long-term  holders  of  a  coin  and  operating  a
masternode to earn a supplemental return in addition to any
appreciation they experience.
10




CHALLENGES OF RUNNING A MASTERNODE
Despite  the  various  benefits  of  and  incentives  to  operate
masternodes, there are still challenges that make running them
out of reach for many.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY
Configuring a masternode can be a challenging task, and is
beyond the abilities of a large portion of crypto users. Besides
technical skills like working from the command line, launching a
masternode also requires a reliable system. Typically this calls
for a virtual server to be set up and configured to ensure the
uptime and performance of the masternode.
A  sample  of  technical  commands  needed  to  launch  a
masternode (dash.org):
11




EXPENSIVE STARTUP COSTS
In  addition  to  the  cost  of  a  dedicated  server  to  host  a
masternode,  users  also  are  required  to  hold  a  minimum
amount of the applicable masternode coins. Dash for instance
requires  masternode  operators  to  hold                            1,000  DASH  as
collateral,  which  would  require  approximately                    $600K+  to
acquire. Most masternode coins are not as expensive as this
but many are still too costly for everyday cryptocurrency users
to acquire.
Recent  minimum  worth  requirements  to  launch  various
masternodes (masternodes.pro):
12




THE NUKLEUS SOLUTION
The Nukleus platform provides solutions to the two biggest
challenges of running a masternode: technical difficulty and
high up-front costs.
ONE-CLICK MASTERNODES
Nukleus makes running a masternode easy enough for anyone.
By providing a user-friendly interface layer the need for strong
technical  skills  is  removed.  Behind  the  scenes  our  flexible
infrastructure   and   scalable   distributed   network   ensure
maximum performance and reliability.
Masternode hosting without Nukleus:

Monitoring
LOW-COST MASTERNODE HOSTING
We will provide the lowest cost masternode hosting possible.
Pricing will be a low flat fee and never cost any percentage of
your masternode proceeds. This is possible due to economies
of scale from our large enterprise as well as proceeds from
Nukleus'  operating  stake  in  masternode  pools,  which  will
subsidize our infrastructure overhead.
14




MASTERNODE POOLS
As discussed masternode coins require users to hold a specific
amount of applicable coins as collateral in order to run a
masternode. In the case of Dash users must hold 1,000 coins,
which have been as expensive as $1,500+ each.
Nukleus solves this problem with masternode pools, which
allow users to pool their masternode coin holdings with other
users. As a result someone with only a small number of coins
can own a stake in a masternode. This makes masternodes
totally accessible for every level of cryptocurrency user.
Users can participate no matter how many coins they have:
User                                                             kleu         erve
User                                                                          cur
ternode
Monitoring
User                                                             Coin Stake

THE LIGHTNING NETWORK AND THE RAIDEN
NETWORK
The Bitcoin and Ethereum communities are rapidly working to
develop a scaling solution for each blockchain. The Lightning
Network will utilize a network of 2-way payment channels to
create a scalable layer on top of the original blockchain. The
Raiden Network will utilize a similar approach combined with a
shift to the less resource intensive proof-of-stake consensus
methodology.
This is important because once implemented these solutions
introduce profit potential for operating Bitcoin and Ethereum
nodes. Nukleus, as an expert in masternode infrastructure, will
be well positioned to capitalize on these innovations.
Once completed, Nukleus will offer one-click hosting and pool
services for Bitcoin and Ethereum nodes on the new Lightning
and Raiden networks. Users of any technical ability will be able
to profit from these new innovations just as they do from our
traditional masternode services.

TOKEN SALE
RISK DISCLOSURE
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NUKLEUS TOKEN AND SALE
Last updated February 28th, 2018
NUKLEUS Token (“NUK”) is a new and innovative product. This memorandum is intended to
apprise you of some of the risks involved with purchasing, buying, owning, and using the NUK
Token. It does not purport to advise you of all of the risks and other significant aspects of the
sale (“Token Sale”) by NUKLEUS LLC., (“NUKLEUS” or “Company”) of NUKLEUS Tokens
(“Tokens”). You should also consider any additional risks and considerations relating to the
Token Sale and consult your own legal, tax, financial and other advisers before entering into any
transaction.
There are a number of risks involved in this Token Sale, as well as the future development,
maintenance and management of NUKLEUS and Tokens. Some of these risks are beyond the
control of the Company. Each person participating in the Token Sale  (“Purchaser”) should
comprehend, consider and evaluate carefully the risks described below in addition to any other
available information before participating in the Token Sale.
Participation in the Token Sale shall be taken as an action based upon careful and prudent
analysis  and  evaluation,and  will  be  deemed  as  the  relevant  Purchaser  having  been  fully
informed, advised and willing to bear all of the risks associated with it, including as set out in
this Agreement.
A purchase of the Tokens is not an investment. There is no guarantee - indeed there is no reason
to believe - that the Tokens you purchase will increase in value. They may decrease in value. For
a more complete description of NUKLEUS and the Tokens, please see NUKLEUS whitepaper,
available  at  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G1Ht9v8algl9dkUbVhIwHmU68qeYN4BZ
the contents of which are incorporated into this document by reference.
1) Risks Associated with Purchaser Credentials
Any third party that gains access to the Purchaser’s login credentials or private keys may be able
to dispose of the Purchaser’s Tokens. To minimize this risk, the Purchaser should guard against
unauthorized access to their electronic devices.
2) Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions
20




Crypto-tokens have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory authorities and may be
overseen by the legal and regulatory authorities of a number of jurisdictions globally. The
functioning of NUKLEUS and the Tokens could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries
or actions, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the use or possession of digital tokens like
the Tokens, which could impede or limit the development of the NUKLEUS platform. The
Company  may  receive  notices,  queries,  warnings,  requests  or  rulings  from  one  or  more
authorities upon short notice, or may even be ordered to suspend or terminate any action in
connection with the Token Sale or the NUKLEUS platform as a whole without prior notice.
Furthermore, many aspects of NUKLEUS also involve untested areas of law and regulation, and
could be subject to new laws or regulation, so their legal and regulatory outcome in all relevant
jurisdictions  is  not  possible  to  predict.  The  planning,  development,  marketing,  promotion,
execution or otherwise of the Company or the Token Sale may be seriously affected, hindered,
postponed or terminated as a result. Since regulatory policies can change with or without prior
notice, any existing regulatory permissions for or tolerance of the Company, NUK and the Token
Sale in any jurisdiction may be withdrawn without warning. The Tokens could be deemed from
time to time as a virtual commodity, a digital asset or even as money, securities or currency in
various jurisdictions and therefore could be prohibited from being sold, purchased, traded,
distributed or held in certain jurisdictions pursuant to local regulations. In turn, NUK could be
deemed to be a regulated or restricted product. There is no guarantee that the Company can
maintain any particular legal or regulatory status in any particular jurisdiction at any time.
3) Risk of Insufficient Interest in NUK
It is possible that NUK will not be used by a large number of businesses, individuals, and other
organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of this
and other distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the
NUKLEUS platform and therefore the potential uses or value of the Tokens.
4)  Risk  that the  NUKLEUS  platform, As Developed, Will  Not Meet  the Expectations  of
Purchaser
The NUKLEUS platform is presently under development and its governance structure, fees,
purpose,  consensus  mechanism,  algorithm,  code,  infrastructure  design  and  other  technical
specifications and parameters may undergo significant changes without notice. Any expectations
regarding the form and functionality of the Tokens or NUKLEUS held by the Purchaser may not
be met, for any number of reasons, including a change in the design and implementation plans
and execution of the NUKLEUS platform.
5) Risk of Theft and Hacking
Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with NUKLEUS or the
availability of the Tokens in any number of ways, including, without limitation, denial of service
attacks,  Sybil  attacks,  spoofing,  smurfing,  malware  attacks,  or  consensus-based  attacks.
Additionally, there may be attempts to steal the Token Sale proceeds. Such theft or attempted
theft may impact the ability of the Company to fund the development or maintenance of the
NUKLEUS platform. While the Company will endeavor to adopt industry best practices to keep
21




the Token Sale proceeds  safe  (including, but  not  limited to,  the use of cold  storage  and
multisignature authentications), successful cyber thefts may still occur.
6) Risk of Flaw in Source Codes
While the Company adopts quality assurance procedures to help ensure the source codes reflect
as accurately as possible their intended operation, the flawlessness of the source codes cannot be
guaranteed. They may contain bugs, defects, inconsistencies, flaws or errors, which may disable
some functionality, create vulnerabilities or cause instability. Such flaws may compromise the
predictability, usability, stability, and/or security of the NUKLEUS platform. Open source codes
rely on transparency to promote community-sourced identification and solution of problems
within the code.
7) Risk of Unpermissioned, Decentralized and Autonomous Ledger
The NUKLEUS platform is being developed in connection with various distributed ledger
systems including, but not limited to, Ethereum, which are unpermissioned protocols that could
be accessed and used by anyone. The utility and integrity of the NUKLEUS platform relies on
the stability, security and popularity of these decentralized ledgers. The NUKLEUS platform is
envisaged to be an open, decentralized community and its composition can include users,
supporters, developers, Token holders and other participants worldwide who may or may not be
connected with the Company in any manner.
8) Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography
Cryptography is evolving and there can be no guarantee of security at all times. Advancement in
cryptography technologies and techniques, including, but not limited to, code cracking, the
development of artificial intelligence and/or quantum computers, could be identified as risks to
all cryptography-based systems, including NUKLEUS and the NUK. When such technologies
and/or  techniques  are  applied  to  NUKLEUS,  adverse  outcomes  such  as  theft,  loss,
disappearance, destruction, devaluation or other compromises may result. The security of the
NUKLEUS platform cannot be guaranteed as the future of cryptography or security innovations
is unpredictable.
9) Risk of Token Mining Attacks
As with other decentralized blockchains, the blockchain used for the NUK is susceptible to
mining attacks, including, but not limited to, double-spend attacks, majority mining power
attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the NUKLEUS
platform. Despite the efforts of the NUKLEUS team, the risk of known or novel mining attacks
exists.
10) Risk of Abandonment or Failure
Due to the technically complex nature of the NUKLEUS platform, the Company or those
contributing to the NUKLEUS software development effort could face difficulties from time to
22




time that may be unforeseeable and/or unresolvable. Accordingly, the development of the NUK
could fail, terminate or be delayed at any time for any reason, including due to lack of funds.
Development failure or termination may render the Tokens untransferable, of reduced or no
utility, and/or obsolete.
11) Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the NUKLEUS Platform
The utility of the Tokens is dependent on the popularity of the NUKLEUS platform. While the
Tokens should not be viewed as an investment, they may have value over time. An absence of
active users or low level of utilization may negatively affect the long-term development and
future of the NUKLEUS platform, and reduce or obviate the utility of the Tokens.
12) Risk of an Illiquid Market
After the Token Launch, the Company is not responsible for and has limited control over the
subsequent circulation and trading of the Tokens. The Token is not money, legal tender or
currency,  fiat  or  otherwise,  issued  by  any  individual,  entity,  central  bank  or  national,
supranational or quasi-national organization, nor is it backed by any type or quantity of assets,
property  or  credits,  nor  does  it  represent  any  entitlement  to  any  distributions  of  profits,
dividends, or any other returns or payments of any kind. There is no obligation of the Company
nor anyone else to redeem, repurchase or acquire any Tokens from any Token holder. There is no
guarantee or assurance that there will be a market or marketplace where holders may readily
trade Tokens.
13) Risk of Price Volatility
Many  cryptographic  tokens  have  volatile  prices.  Large  fluctuations  in  price  over  short
timeframes occur frequently. Such fluctuations could result from market dynamics (including,
but  not  limited  to,  speculation),  regulatory  changes,  technical  advancements,  exchange
availabilities and other factors that impact the equilibrium between token supply and demand.
14) Risk of Exposure to Cryptographic Tokens
After the completion of this Token Sale, the Company expects that a certain portion of the
proceeds will be held in cryptographic tokens. The Company expects to convert an appropriate
proportion of cryptographic tokens received into fiat currencies at the sole discretion of the
management of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, no Token holder has any right, title or
interest in any such cryptographic tokens.
15) Risk of Masternode Tokens’ Modification of Payouts
Due to the NUKLEUS platform’s inherent reliance on  3rd party token platforms and their
respective  developers  and  management,  the  payment  structure  which  Company collects  in
exchange for hosting masternode points may change unpredictably or be reduced to make
hosting masternodes for any given token unprofitable. There is no guarantee or warranty of any
23




kind that hosting masternode points will produce any type of income for the Company or any
Purchaser.
16) Risk of Uninsured Losses
Unlike bank accounts  or accounts at some other financial institutions, funds held using a
blockchain network are generally uninsured. In the event of loss or loss of value, there is no
public insurer, such as the FDIC or private insurer, to offer recourse to the Purchaser.
17) Risk of Privacy and Data Retention Issues
As part of the Token Sale and the subsequent verification processes, the Company may collect
personal information from Purchasers. The collection of such information is subject to applicable
laws and regulations. All information collected will be used for purposes of Token Sale and
community management for the NUKLEUS platform and may be transferred to contractors,
service providers and consultants worldwide as appointed by the Company. Apart from external
compromises, the Company and its appointed entities may also suffer from internal security
breach whereby their employees may misappropriate, misplace or lose personal information of
Purchasers. The Company may be required to expend significant financial resources to alleviate
problems caused by any breaches or losses, settle fines and resolve inquiries from regulatory or
government authorities. Any information breaches or losses will also damage the Company
reputation and thereby may harm its long term prospects.
18) Risk of Malfunction in the NUKLEUS
It is possible that the NUKLEUS platform malfunctions in an unfavorable way, including, but
not limited to, one that results in the loss of Tokens, or information concerning a market.
19) Risk Relating to Use of the Internet or Other Electronic Medium
Without limiting the foregoing risks, any communication or transaction via or information
(including document) transmitted via the internet or other electronic medium involves risks and
by participating in the Token Sale or utilizing NUK, you acknowledge that you understand and
accept the following risks:
•    We and/or third parties may use such authentication technologies as we deem
appropriate. No authentication, verification or computer security technology is
completely secure or safe. You agree to bear all risks of unauthorized access/use, hacking
or identity theft.
•    The internet or other electronic media (including, without limitation, electronic devices,
services of third party telecom service providers such as mobile phones or other handheld
trading devices or interactive voice response systems) are an inherently unreliable form
of communication.
•    Any information (including any document) transmitted, or communication or transactions
made, over the internet or through other electronic media (including electronic devices,
services of third party telecom service providers such as mobile phones or other handheld
24




trading devices or interactive voice response systems) may be subject to interruption,
transmission blackout, delayed transmission due to data volume, internet traffic, market
volatility or incorrect data transmission (including incorrect price quotation) or stoppage
of price data feed due to the public nature of the internet or other electronic media.
•    As a result of such unreliability there may be time-lags, delays, failures or loss of data or
loss of confidentiality in the transmission of data and receipt of communications; and
while the Company may believe certain data to be reliable, there may be no independent
basis for it to verify or contradict the accuracy or completeness of data.
•    This is not an exhaustive list of all of the consequences arising from such unreliability.
•    Purchasers are solely responsible for preventing anything which may be harmful to any
equipment that they use in connection with the Tokens or the NUKLEUS platform
(including any computer virus, malicious program or harmful component) from affecting
any such equipment, regardless of whether it originated in connection with the Tokens or
the NUKLEUS platform.
20) Tax Risk Relating to Participation in the Token Sale
The taxability of cryptographic tokens is an evolving area of law, is subject to change, and may
vary amongst jurisdictions. In some instances, there may be little or no formal regulatory
guidance. Participation in the Token Sale may have tax reporting implications and liabilities for
Purchasers,  and  such  liabilities  and  obligations  shall  be  borne  by  the  Purchasers  alone.
Purchasers are advised to consult their tax advisors prior to participating in the Token Sale.
21) Unanticipated Risks
Applied cryptography and blockchain technology are new and untested. In addition to the risks
set forth here, there are risks that the NUKLEUS team cannot anticipate. Risks may further
materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the risks set forth here.
