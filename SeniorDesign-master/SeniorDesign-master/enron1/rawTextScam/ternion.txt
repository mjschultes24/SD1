As it can be evident from the table above, The Ternion Payment Processor will be standing out
among other top payment processors due to being regulated and supporting more currencies.
The Ternion Payment Processor has been already planned and verified by a partner company
(Flashboys) to be working. Furthermore, it keeps up-to-speed with the other leading payment
processor platforms and offers cards, an app and integrated exchange to ease the payment
transactions. Moreover, we will be partnering with banks making the Payment Processor more
efficient and more secure.
5.3 Competitive Advantages
The detailed market opportunity for the Ternion Exchange can be found in Chapter 3.2.
The current situation on the market shows us a need for a newly established, regulated, licensed
fiat-to-crypto exchange. If we take a look at current exchanges, then we can see that there is only
a handful of those who have license, and even a smaller number of them who have fiat-to-crypto
exchange and excellent customer service. Ternion provides both of them, thus, we can conclude
that the monthly volume of these exchanges will be the bare minimum of the trade volume
Ternion can expect per year. These numbers will be enhanced due to a large amount of money
that Ternion plans to use on advertising opportunities and placing the Exchange on the top of all
search engines.

Key assumptions for forecasted expenses:
•  The numbers of expenses represent the costs that have been similar to other large scale
Brokerage companies that operate under a similar business model and that have been
working with or have belonged to the shareholders of Ternion.
•  The numbers that are mentioned and shown represent only cryptocurrency trading without a
marginal business model.
•  The cost goes up in value each year due to a new representative office opening in countries,
which is cost efficient, but legally well bound to operations.

7. The Ternion Token Economics
Ternion’s ecosystem will be supported by the TRN Utility Token. The TRN Token is an ERC-
20 compliant token to be issued on the Ethereum blockchain. The TRN token will be the core
payment mechanism for all goods and services exchanged through the Ternion Ecosystem, and
will give a competitive advantage to those who use it in the Ternion Ecosystem.
Overview of the Ternion Ecosystem
Within the Ternion Ecosystem, all internal revenue-generating mechanisms are geared towards
upholding the Ternion Liquidity Fund. Just as the Ternion Financial Model relies on natural market
forces to support Ternion liquidity, so too does the utility functionality of the Ternion token. The
TRN token is exceptionally well integrated into the Ternion Ecosystem, serving as a method of
exchange for fees incurred through the Ternion Exchange and the Ternion Payments business. If a
party wants to list on our Exchange, then it can pay commission fees with the Ternion tokens and
get a lower price. This utility mechanism may result in higher demand for the TRN token, which is
then channeled back into the ecosystem, creating a contained cycle of supply and demand.
Accredited Investors
For accredited investors we are selling a token which shall be repurchased with 25% of the
company’s profit once per quarter at a determined price. For more details please contact the team
directly at info@ternion.io and schedule a conference call.
Public Sale
For the Public sale, we are selling a token which can be used to pay commission on a discount
and access additional services on the exchange and payment mechanism.
The utility tokens which will be used for payment of commission and listings will be sent to the
token burn program. Please refer to section 7.3 for more details.
7.1 The Token Utility Features: Liquidity Support
The TRN is a utility token positioned to grant users access to a variety of benefits within the
Ternion Ecosystem. TRN utility functions include to pay for:

7.2 Ternion Exchange: Trading Fee Discounts
Ternion wants to encourage users to pay for their trading fees with the TRN tokens. Users will be
heavily incentivized to use TRN tokens by receiving significant discounted trading fees. Trading
fees will move in three well-defined stages. The circulating supply of TRN tokens will determine
the current stage. When the Ternion Exchange is launched for public trading in September, the
TRN token holders can start instantly using the tokens on the Exchange, for example, to lower
their commission fees.
All the TRN tokens that have been received as a part of promotions can be sold only in one year.
In the meantime, they can be used to pay the commission fees on the platform. This procedure is
essential for sustaining the value of the token.

7.3 Financial Model: Asset Price via Token Burn
In order to facilitate reliable liquidity, Ternion operates around a financial model built on market
forces. The Ternion financial model and the ecosystem that supports it ensure the Ternion token
remains relevant and provides a competitive advantage. The Ternion token (TRN) is an intrinsic
part of the Ecosystem and serves as the native currency for Ternion’s three fundamental pillars:
The Exchange, Ternion Payments and The Liquidity Reserve.

8.2 Token Sale
Token Sale Dates
The Ternion token sale is split into Pre A,  A, B, C rounds. Presale and a Public Token Sale.
Token Presale (Pre-A round)
The Presale will run until: June 28th 2018.
The pre-sale will allow Ternion to raise the necessary funds to begin building the exchange,
having a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) available during the Public Token Sale. The pre-sale will
also help us acquire valuable feedback early on in the build, contributing to the efficiency of the
exchange development process.
The funds raised during the public pre-sale will be used primarily for development and growth
efforts, though a fraction will still go towards laying the foundation of the Ternion Liquidity Fund.

11. Roadmap
Working on the Ternion Ecosystem, our primary objective is to reduce the amount of time lost
between major milestones and give contributors access to the Ternion Ecosystem immediately
following the public sale. This will give us a decisive edge against competitors who tend to be
mired in lengthy delivery times post-token sale. The following roadmap includes all the major
steps in the development of the Ternion Ecosystem.
