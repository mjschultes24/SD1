UltraNote (XUN) White Paper
ABSTRACT
‘’UltraNote has been designed to solve the core problems inherent to two of the most important
aspects of everyone’s daily life which are; communication and exchanging money which require
both privacy and security. ‘’
UltraNote is a secure and privacy centred open source digital asset which is accessible to all. With
UltraNote you will not only take control over your freedom but also act as your own ‘’bank’’. You
and only you will control and hold responsibility for your funds. Your accounts and transactions are
kept private from intrusive eyes through peer to peer encryption technology.  UltraNote uses
advanced cryptographic techniques, namely zero-knowledge proofs, to guarantee the validity of
transactions without revealing sensitive information about them.                                          UltraNote                                                                                 transactions are private,
untraceable and anonymous.
The                                                                                                       UltraNote                                                                                 Blockchain is a mutually distributed ledger that creates, distributes, facilitates storage
and finally executes the exchange of the cryptographic assets (XUN) via its wallets. The                  UltraNote
Blockchain forms the ecosystem of the digital asset, which has been structured to deliver a set of
financial and communication solutions. With                                                               UltraNote you will get to enjoy; enhanced security,
greater utility (Desktop GUI, Online as well as mobile wallet), increased scalability (400+ TPS), wider
acceptance, improved efficiency and above all unchallenged privacy. Similar to every blockchain
platform,                                                                                                 UltraNote payments are stored on the blockchain in order to keep the books balanced but
the sender, recipient, and content of each transaction remain anonymous and untraceable. With the
Self Destruct message feature you are guaranteed that your message transaction hash is destroyed
making it simply inexistent on the blockchain.
At the heart of the system is an optimised version of Bitcoin, offering a fully decentralized open
source digital asset which allows enthusiasts to contribute to its development and moreover help
bring new ideas to the table on a highly empowering and individual level. With the core principles of
the Digital Assets system in mind, the                                                                    UltraNote platform has been designed to increase global
prosperity through improvements in the quality and efficiency of its asset exchange. In addition to
the Anonymous and Untraceable Funds Transfer facility, UltraNote wallet offers a P2P Encrypted
Messaging with IPFS Encrypted File Transfer Service, Bank like facility such as Deposit for Interest of
3% per year and Integrated CPU Wallet Mining. Within the UltraNote ecosystem; Individuals,
Businesses, Cooperatives and Merchants can freely exchange UltraNote coins for payments, Deposit
Coins as a Store of Value as well as transfer Confidential Data such as video, voice recordings as well
as confidential documents without the involvement of indiscrete  3rd  parties like email service
providers, banks or governmental institutions.
Furthermore  instead  of  establishing  value  on                                                         UltraNote  assets                                                                         via  government  backing  or
declarations from regulating bodies, unlike accustomed commodities like gold or oil, the value of
UltraNote is solely based on the quality and soundness of the ecosystem. In a world where
governments  dictate  our  financial  activities, monitor  our  communications  and  data  collection
institutions stealing our private data from social media and regular service providers; offering an
environment of Trust, anonymity and total self-sufficiency is fundamental to UltraNote. Putting the
community first, ultimately through mass adoption, a more efficient and better-calibrated system of
value will be established to promote prosperity and privacy among a larger and more diverse global
population.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, right after the world financial crisis of 2008, the rapid
adoption of what once was qualified as an unrealistic and impossible project is now taking a real
strategic turn to full adoption over the next 10 years. European, Asian and Middle East governments
as well as banks are finally recognising the power and competitive threat of digital assets. Either Fed
by fear of being left behind or realizing the true power of Blockchain technology they are now also
encouraging the introduction of equivalent technology in their core business activities.
While the principal idea behind Bitcoin was to shake down and reshape the way we use and move
money around the world, as a self regulated ecosystem offering confidential, faster and cheaper
facilities as compared to fiat currency, Digital assets are also identified to be capable of empowering
global population either in distressed regions as well as 1st world countries to regain power over
their wealth. Allowing any Smartphone with an internet connection to turn into a personal and
confidential ‘’bank’’ account, digital assets aim to give citizens of the world indifferent of age, race,
location and wealth, the opportunity to store and use their money in a unified and democratic way.
Early adopters and visionaries are already reaping the benefits of their early investments, as the
numbers speak for themselves. Bitcoin since 2009 appreciated from $.01 to $10,000 in 2017 scoring
an increase of 1,000,000 X over 8 Years and only in 2017 recorded a raise of above 400X. The total
digital asset market capitalisation is today in 2017 at $500 Billion from $30Billion over just 9 Months.
Note: (This Document is constantly being updated but since market figures are always moving; we are keeping the market reference
numbers recorded at the time the first whitepaper was published)
Technology-based money known as Digital Assets or Cryptocurrency is now a reality and is poised to
develop for generations to come by recruiting more and more adepts as days go by. Bitcoin the
pioneer of this emerging asset class has now paved the way and moreover demonstrated how it is
possible  to establish  Digitalized  and  furthermore Decentralize  ecosystems built on  blockchain
technology.
Even though Bitcoin and Blockchain technology has a lot to be praised for; the digital asset industry
is not yet as glamorous and well-rounded as we may think. For instance anonymity, price as well as
scalability/ liquidity remain major barriers to mass-adoption. Even though Bitcoin, Bitcoin clone
coins or Bitcoin like coins allow keeping the names and identifications of users confidential since
only the digital (wallet) addresses are used to interact, it is still not as private as cash. Using a
mutually  distributed  transparent  ledger,  transactions  within  the  Bitcoin  or  Bitcoin  like  coins
ecosystem can be easily retraced and pointed to specific individuals (see link below). The price of Bitcoin
furthermore in regards to mass adoption is not an easy factor to deal with neither. With a low
liquidity& limited total supply of 21 Million coins, the price of 1 Bitcoin is now at around $10,000
from an all time high of $19,600. With moreover fees becoming more and more expensive, Bitcoin is
now simply unaffordable to nearly  92% of the world’s population.    Scalability should also be
considered as a challenge for Bitcoin and Bitcoin clone coins since being able to handle only 7
Transaction  per  seconds  it  is  unimaginable  to  see  Bitcoin  progress  via  mass  adoption  while
transactions are being delayed by hours like we witnessed during the end of 2017. Litecoin for
instance can handle up to 57 Transactions per Seconds but we are not there yet for a comfortable
mass adoption.

2.0 ULTRANOTE VS. ALTCOINS
Over the past 8 years the huge international success of Bitcoin has of course brought much attention
to blockchain technology. Over the years, trying to improve the way people carry business as well as
routine daily activities, several developers have also decided to implement their own blockchain
start-ups.  Today  in  May                                                                                  2018,  https://www.livecoinwatch.com/  the  cryptocurrency  reference
website in regard to listing and sorting of cryptocurrencies/ Altcoins already has around 2000 listed
Digital Assets each of them looking to write their own success story and name on the leader board
next to Bitcoin.
Unfortunately this ‘’Bull Run’’ has also brought along several challenges for the digital assets industry
actors. Scams as well as ‘’ridiculous’’ projects are surging everywhere like wild mushrooms making
some Altcoins easy quick money making avenues for several groups of unreliable developers. Mainly
running through ICOs their actions are of course hindering trust while promoting greed and creating
confusions among interested investors/ users confused about where to put their money. From this
perspective it is essential for UltraNote to show that we care about general public education and get
them  to  understand  how  UltraNote’s  mission  and  vision  align  with  the  true  values  of
Decentralisation and furthermore what UltraNote has to offer within a privacy focused ecosystem.
While majority of Altcoins develop their business model to be a newer or better version of Bitcoin
which is at the end of the day only an alternative payment avenue to fiat currencies with some level
of confidentiality. UltraNote is bringing to the market real unmatched added value through a range
of comprehensive Communication and Financial services. UltraNote is Untraceable & Anonymous
allowing Private Fund Transfers, P2P Messaging with IPFS Encrypted File Transfers. With the Bank-
Like Deposit service UltraNote additionally allows users to deposit coins for interest of 3% per year.
Positioned to lead mass adoption UltraNote Coin is again ahead of the curve by offering Wallet
Integrated CPU Mining which allows anyone with a computer to mine UltraNote coins at minimum
costs. Taking full advantage of blockchain technology; UltraNote is the go-to coin for new digital
currency adepts as well as avid Cryptocurrency users by setting new standards.
Providing unmatched cutting edge technology such as Anonymous & Untraceable Transactions,
Asset Deposit for Interest, P2P Messaging, IPFS Encrypted File Transfers, Integrated CPU Wallet
Mining and 400+ TPS UltraNote, comfortably confirms its superiority to Bitcoin as well as majority of
Altcoins.

3.0 ULTRANOTE VISION & MISSION
At UltraNote our Vision & Mission is to establish a truly Anonymous as well as Untraceable global
Communication and Financial platform which will unlock unquestionable privacy for every citizen of
the world. Eliminating the drawbacks of  traditional communication and financial channels by
adapting to the new digital age, UltraNote is now setting grounds to provide a better, safer and
egalitarian environment for people to interact and transfer assets.                                      ’’Why pay greedy Bankers
massive fees to transfer money to a family member or pay your bills when you can pay yourself via
mining fees’’
Our focus is set on delivering solutions that improve people’s lives and empower citizens of the
world to experience freedom of interaction without concerns about censorship or institutions
monitoring their communications or finances. As a result each UltraNote user also becomes hacker
worthless. At UltraNote we are highly committed to provide an environment where privacy and
anonymity is respected and stays unbreakable.
Until today the worldwide power distribution was unfortunately mostly in favour of a handful of
individuals known as the ‘’elites’’, who fed their craving for power through unfair regulations, bans,
embargoes, economic sanctions, restrictions, censorship and even great depressions or dictatorship.
Although humanity hopes to overcome global crises through education and internationalization, we
still fail to take control over our lives and enjoy true freedom. With such a powerful asset as
UltraNote it is now time for all of us to regain access to our fundamental rights.
In A World Where Everyone Spies On Each Other, You Have To Be Invisible To Protect Your Privacy!

amount of assets is necessary to ensure that at any given time enough coins are distributed and
made available to secure the transactions. With 85 Billion coins mined over 30 years it has been
observed that as time goes by and mass adoption grows, UltraNote will allow for liquidity without
disturbing the asset value as well as   protect it from hyper inflation which will be in total harmony
with the major aim of UltraNote as a digital asset. ‘’Empower people by providing affordable access
to state of the art communication and Financial technology while being able to self manage their
own funds within their own means. Rich or poor we should all have the right to own a few UltraNote
coins, Freedom is for everyone’’

Upcoming Launch & Release
   Smartphone apps:
1.  Upcoming: IOS- Android Q4 2018 - Q2 2019
IOS and Android Apps for mobile wallets with fully integrated features as well as contact less
payments are for UltraNote a fundamental part of its long term growth. In this perspective, mobile
wallets will be implemented along the medium term time frame to allow optimised usability
together with social integration of UltraNote worldwide.
4.4 Capital Appreciation
With a limited amount of coins mined over a predefined time frame; capital appreciation is simply a
by product of demand and supply which directly influence the price of the asset. Adapting to a
growing amount of daily transactions and a fixed deposit facility paying annual interest rate, it is
inevitable that UltraNote will overtime develop a capital appreciation ecosystem which will allow
any stage adopters to be rewarded for believing in the UltraNote project. With an inverted supply
curve, it is also expected to witness a more stable price action over the years as compared to other
well-known coins jigsaw price pattern. UltraNote supply will match UltraNote demand growth
making it always affordable and resilient to hyperinflation. Nevertheless, similar to any traded asset,
capital appreciation cannot be guaranteed. (This section should not be considered as an invitation to
buy UltraNote for capital gains. The aim is only to depict the vision of UltraNote)
UltraNote

4.5 Distribution & Acquisition of UltraNote Coins (XUN)
1st stage UltraNote will only be available via mining which will distribute the coins among miners. It
has been identified that in order to make UltraNote available to everyone and encourage an organic
growth;  No  ICO  will  be  implemented  on  UltraNote  which  will  provide  assurance  that  every
interested party/stakeholder gets a fair chance on acquiring UltraNote.
2nd stage UltraNote will be listed on exchanges where miners will be able to cash out (sell) their
UltraNote coins at market value. The UltraNote conversion to Bitcoin  - Litecoin  - Ethereum  -
Monero & WeyCoins will allow miners and regular users to enjoy their coins as they wish. As stated
above UltraNote Development Team together with Community Leaders have already been able to
get UltraNote Listed on 4 Exchanges but it does not stop there. We are also in constant negotiation
with cryptocurrency exchanges for new listings as well as strategic partners and payments service
providers. It is fundamental for the development team to get the best Deal possible for every
stakeholder: Miners, Exchanges as well as the UltraNote Community. As time goes by and the
UltraNote network grows we will be able to simultaneously expand our partnerships with new
merchants along with mainstream service providers.
4.6 Fixed-Limited Supply
A fixed and predefined amount of 85 Billion UltraNote coins will be mined over 30 years. The
distribution and mining of UltraNote will still be running for our next generations of users to allow
the maximum of people to participate in this new adventure. Although the Digital Asset class is still
at its infancy stage, we are anticipating a steady expansion of the users’ network over the next 10
years. A fair amount of UltraNote coins will not only create an excellent level of liquidity to provide
for micro-payments but also stabilize the level of inflation on the asset so as to again allow a wider
global participation and organic growth due to its affordable price. Furthermore, with an inverted
supply curve we can expect a more stable price action, UltraNote supply will adapt to a growing
demand instead of diminishing supply while demands increases. Furthermore the limited supply of
85 Billon coins guarantee the rarity of UltraNote Coins which by default protects the ecosystem from
depreciation practices well known from governments when printing new bank notes and making
money supply unlimited.
Even if 85 Billion coins can be perceived as enormous; moving the decimal place to 6 instead of 8 or
even 12 like other well-known digital assets; the UltraNote Atomic-Unit supply aligns perfectly with
the major brands supply, thus solving the issue of dividing coins to several decimal places when
dealing with micro transactions. Furthermore while keeping the total supply at a fair level for mass
adoption, since by 2047 the world population is estimated to be at around 8.4 Billion People, it has
been observed that even with a mid-range market penetration there will be enough coins for
everyone without facing any oversupply situation.
An example of XUN supply against other Altcoins:
18,446,744.073709551616                                                                                   -12   (Monero)
21,000,000.00000000                                                                                       -8    (Bitcoin)
85,000,000,000.000000                                                                                     -6    (UltraNote)

4.7 Proof of Holding & Deposit for Interest
In order to encourage mass-adoption and offer a fair avenue to people of any background to grown
their net worth within a prosperous ecosystem; a Bank-Like Fixed Deposit facility paying an annual
interest rate of 3% is available to UltraNote users. With an annual interest rate comparable to
conventional deposit/saving accounts at entities like banks or mainstream financial institutions,
UltraNote is well positioned to take the lead as a value storage asset too.
4.8 Fully Encrypted-Anonymous & Untraceable Ecosystem
The UltraNote ecosystem is based on the highly encrypted and impenetrable CryptoNote Algorithm
and  IPFS  Protocol  allowing  complete  autonomy,  untraceability,  anonymity  and  privacy  while
transferring funds or communicating within the UltraNote ecosystem. To any entity either within or
outside of the UltraNote ecosystem you are simply a Ghost.
4.9 Convertibility
UltraNote coins distributed among community members as stated previously will of course be
tradable on relevant recognised cryprocurrency exchanges allowing UltraNote holders to convert
their  coins  to  either  Bitcoin  or  other  major  cryptocurrencies  and  Fiat  currency.  Merchants’
partnerships will in addition contribute to the convertibility options available to UltraNote Holders
since they will be able to pay for their bills as well as their goods and services directly with UltraNote
Coins from their Wallets.   The future implementation of contactless payment via UltraNote mobile
wallet on smart phones IOS & Android will furthermore consolidate the convertibility of UltraNote
coins.
5.0 ULTRANOTE TARGET MARKET
As a true Anonymous, Untraceable and moreover Egalitarian Digital Asset, UltraNote is designed to
appeal to a wide international audience due to its simplicity of utilisation, mining specifications as
well as affordability.
Developed to offer a trustworthy and comfortable environment for adults as well as younger people
to interact, we believe that regardless of someone’s profile everyone can easily benefit from
UltraNote. Anyone should be able to privately and safely message a loved one and share holiday
pictures away from intrusive eyes. Similarly anyone should be able to transfer funds to a loved one
with minimum fees calculated in cents as compared to mainstream money transfer facilities like
MoneyGram or Western Union charging between 8% to 10% of the amount transferred.
As a very safe and affordable cryptocurrency for the mass-market we are expecting parents to feel
comfortable enough to make UltraNote their go to digital asset in regard to their children pocket
money and financial education. Children as well as adults can feel safe using their UltraNote coins on
the relevant platforms while enjoying the freedom of taking care of their own finances and build up
their net worth with the fixed deposit service of UltraNote.

8.0 ULTRANOTE TECHNOLOGY
UltraNote is initially build on the Cryptonote Blockchain technology on which is also based Monero
as well as Bytecoin our main running mates. Nevertheless even if we share the same technology, our
team of developers and analysts have been able to come up with UltraNote with a far better
implementation of Cryptonote Technology as developed above. ‘’If you like Monero your will love
UltraNote’’. Since the launch of UltraNote we have brought much development to the Algo which
makes UltraNote a unique project even if sharing the DNA of other CryptoNote Coins.
In order to better understand the technology behind UltraNote; the following tech specifications
have been directly imported from CryptoNote Website. https://cryptonote.org/inside/
CryptoNote Philosophy
CryptoNote  is  the  technology  that  allows  the  creation  of  completely  anonymous  egalitarian
cryptocurrencies. A number of our community members have been focused on research and
development for more than a decade. We aim to promote the derived principles to influence the
contemporary economic paradigm.
The current power distribution on our planet is the legacy of the world where the economy is
controlled by the few. The status quo was shaped throughout centuries, making human beings
engage in rat races, detrimental rivalry, and bloodshed. In spite of humanity's hope to overcome
local crises through education and internationalization, we still fail to have full control over our lives.
However,  state-of-the-art  advancements  in  technology,  mathematics,  and  cryptography  may
become the key to subvert this paradigm. The advent of cryptocurrencies is the first sign that the
new world is coming. It is marked with a hope that the economy will interlace with the technology,
that communities will set new transparent principles, and impartial cryptographic algorithms will
control its implementation.
It is in our philosophy to encourage enlightenment through breakthrough innovations. Emancipation
begins with laymen getting access to financial resources that will give the oppressed the hope for
quality education, drinking water, and a better life. CryptoNote is not about creating yet another
digital currency. It is the mindset and concepts that represent the first small step to regain the
power over ourselves in order to live peacefully and prosper.

Ring Signatures: Untraceable Payments
The ordinary digital signature (e.g. (EC)DSA, Schnorr, etc...) verification process involves the public
key of the signer. It is a necessary condition, because the signature actually proves that the author
possesses the corresponding secret key. But it is not always a sufficient condition.
Ordinary signature
Ring signature [1] is a more sophisticated scheme, which in fact may demand several different public
keys for verification. In the case of ring signature, we have a group of individuals, each with their
own secret and public key. The statement proved by ring signatures is that the signer of a given
message is a member of the group. The main distinction with the ordinary digital signature schemes
is that the signer needs a single secret key, but a verifier cannot establish the exact identity of the
signer. Therefore, if you encounter a ring signature with the public keys of Alice, Bob and Carol, you
can only claim that one of these individuals was the signer but you will not be able to pinpoint him
or her.
Ring signature

This concept can be used to make digital transactions sent to the network untraceable by using the
public keys of other members in the ring signature one will apply to the transaction. This approach
proves that the creator of the transaction is eligible to spend the amount specified in the transaction
but his identity will be indistinguishable from the users whose public keys he used in his ring
signatures.
Untraceable transactions
It should be noted that foreign transactions do not restrict you from spending your own money. Your
public key may appear in dozens of others' ring signatures but only as a muddling factor (even if you
already used the corresponding secret key for signing your own transaction). Moreover, if two users
create ring signatures with the same set of public keys, the signatures will be different (unless they
use the same private key).

One-Time Keys: Unlinkable Transactions
Normally, when you post your public address, anyone can check all your incoming transactions even
if they are hidden behind a ring signature. To avoid linking you can create hundreds of keys and send
them to your payers privately, but that deprives you of the convenience of having a single public
address.
Linkable transactions
CryptoNote solves this dilemma by an automatic creation of multiple unique one-time keys, derived
from the single public key, for each p2p payment. The solution lies in a clever modification of
the Diffie-Hellman exchange protocol[1]. Originally it allows two parties to produce a common
secret key derived from their public keys. In our version the sender uses the receiver's public address
and his own random data to compute a one-time key for the payment.
The sender can produce only the public part of the key, whereas only the receiver can compute the
private part; hence the receiver is the only one who can release the funds after the transaction is
committed. He only needs to perform a single-formula check on each transactions to establish if it
belongs to him. This process involves his private key, therefore no third party can perform this check
and discover the link between the one-time key generated by the sender and the receiver's unique
public address.

Unlinkable transactions
An important part of our protocol is usage of random data by the sender. It always results in a
different one-time key even if the sender and the receiver both remain the same for all transactions
(that is why the key is called "one-time"). Moreover, even if they are both the same person, all the
one-time keys will also be absolutely unique.
Double-Spending Proof
Fully anonymous signatures would allow spending the same funds many times which, of course, is
incompatible with any payment system's principles. The problem can be fixed as follows.
A ring signature is actually a class of crypto-algorithms with different features. The one CryptoNote
uses is the modified version of the "Traceable ring signature" [1]. In fact we transformed traceability
into linkability. This property restricts a signer's anonymity as follows: if he creates more than one
ring signature using the same private key  (the set of foreign public keys is irrelevant), these
signatures will be linked together which indicates a double-spending attempt.
To support linkability CryptoNote introduced a special marker being created by a user while signing,
which we called a key image. It is the value of a cryptographic one-way function of the secret key, so
in math terms it is actually an image of this key. One-wayness means that given only the key image it
is impossible to recover the private key. On the other hand, it is computationally impossible to find a
collision (two different private keys, which have the same image). Using any formula, except for the
specified one, will result in an unverifiable signature. All things considered, the key image is
unavoidable, unambiguous and yet an anonymous marker of the private key.

Key image via one-way function
All users keep the list of the used key images (compared with the history of all valid transactions it
requires an insignificant amount of storage) and immediately reject any new ring signature with a
duplicate key image. It will not identify the misbehaving user, but it does prevent any double-
spending attempts, caused by malicious intentions or software errors.

Cryptonote Blockchain Analysis Resistance
There are many academic papers dedicated to the analysis of the Bitcoin's blockchain. Their authors
trace the money flow, identify the owners of coins, determine wallet balances and so on. The ability
to make such analysis is due to the fact that all the transfers between addresses are transparent:
every input in a transaction refers to a unique output. Moreover, users often re-use their old
addresses, receiving and sending coins from them many times, which simplifies the analyst's work. It
happens unintentionally: if you have a public address (for example, for donations), you are sure to
use this address in many inputs and transactions.
CryptoNote is designed to mitigate the risks associated with key re-usage and one-input-to-one-
output tracing. Every address for a payment is a unique one-time key, derived from both the
sender's and the recipient's data. It can appear twice with a probability of a 256-bit hash collision. As
soon as you use a ring signature in your input, it entails the uncertainty: which output has just been
spent?
Trying to draw a graph with addresses in the vertices and transactions on the edges, one will get a
tree: a graph without any cycles (because no key/address was used twice). Moreover, there are
billions of possible graphs, since every ring signature produces ambiguity. Thus, you can't be certain
from which possible sender the transaction-edge comes to the address-vertice. Depending on the
size of the ring you will guess from "one out of two" to "one out of a thousand". Every next
transaction increases the entropy and creates additional obstacles for an analyst.

Standard Cryptonote Transaction
A standard CryptoNote transaction is generated by the following sequence covered in the white
paper.
Bob decides to spend an output, which was sent to the one-time public key. He needs Extra (1),
TxOutNumber (2), and his Account private key (3) to recover his one-time private key (4).
When sending a transaction to Carol, Bob generates its Extra value by random (5). He uses Extra (6),
TxOutNumber (7) and Carol's Account public key (8) to get her Output public key (9).
In the input Bob hides the link to his output among the foreign keys (10). To prevent double-
spending he also packs the Key image, derived from his One-time private key (11).
Finally, Bob signs the transaction, using his One-time private key (12), all the public keys (13) and Key
Image (14). He appends the resulting Ring Signature to the end of the transaction (15).

9.0 CONCLUSION
Since 2009, Digital Assets and Blockchain Technology have together certainly received more than
enough attention in order to become the hottest subject on the streets. Millions of fiat currencies
are being converted into digital assets everyday with a momentum never seen before. Is it the right
time to start paying attention? Unquestionably yes! This technology is and will for a long time keep
disrupting the way we do business as well as spend money everyday. At the moment the market is
certainly very volatile due to several unknown variables that are creating as much hope, excitement,
speculation as well as fear. Will digital assets eradicate fiat currency like many people tend to
believe?  Certainly  not!  Simply  because  without  Fiat  Currency,  Digital  Assets  will  have  no
benchmarking value.
At UltraNote we believe that digital assets as a new asset class has it very own place in an
environment where privacy and autonomy is often compromised. As a service provider we expect
UltraNote as well as other valuable digital assets to co-exist in harmony within their respective
established ecosystem. Similar to any asset class, without fiat currency as a scale of value, an asset is
worthless. The key factor is how we use UltraNote to use our fiat currency more efficiently.
Only time will tell how Digital Asset will establish itself but if one thing is certain; it is that
cryptocurrency is here to stay and grow. Digital Assets and blockchain technology are still at their
infancy state and yet have to achieve mainstream adoption to start expanding further. The internet
took almost 2 decades to become what it is today and yet has so much more to offer. Patience will
definitely be very generous to anyone who is willing to put a few Dollars or Euros into UltraNote or
other solid digital assets as the upcoming  5 years will definitely set solid grounds for what is
described as the currency of the new age.
After several years of research and thorough analysis carried out by our expert developers and
analysts, we are confident that UltraNote has been executed to be perfectly positioned to record
solid organic growth over the next 3-5 years going through mass-adoption, before exploring new
horizons such as high profile organisations taking advantage of the cheaper and more cost efficient
encrypted communication tools offered by UltraNote. The business applications of UltraNote are
furthermore limitless and this is what makes UltraNote a very valuable asset for those who know
how to identify long term value propositions.
We humbly invite you to get involved with UltraNote by joining us on our various social media
platforms as well as download your wallet on Ultranote.org to start mining with us for a fair chance
to prosperity.
Launch is scheduled for the 4th Of November 2017.
Good luck Everyone!
Warmest Wishes,
UltraNote Team
