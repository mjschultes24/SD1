Vision
The  Crypto-Currency  market  is  growing  at  an  enormous  rate,  and  many  governmental
organizations are fearing that they might overtake the fiat currencies in no time. Of course, that
would seem impossible if you are already an expert in this market. However, it is quite an
interesting theory that we might have to be prepared for, because nobody knows how far and
how big this market will end up.
AliBabaCoin is an open-source platform to develop the digital crypto currency market spaces
and objects of any purpose, as well as their quick launch and integration into a unique ecosystem.
The platform is maintained by a business crypto economy and is powered by Blockchain.
AlibabaCoin is a new development of crypto-based currency that will be using new features and
techniques  of  security  and  encryptions  so  that  worldwide  payment  solutions  can  provide
customers with liable modules for payment and transactions. Personal information needs a new
format of being kept safe and solid. AlibabaCoin Foundation will provide the world a new
solution where nobody will have to be afraid of keeping their crypto on their portable devices.
Although we cannot avoid using fiat currency, it is quite obvious that we are carrying less paper
money in our leather wallets, and they have all been converted into digital assets kept in banks or
credit cards. Eventually, they are featured in a similar format as crypto’s and are used in our
daily lives these days. The world is gradually initiating that crypto is a better format for keeping
your assets safely and decentralized. However, there have been several cases of malicious attacks
and disturbances in the market where robbery and hacking events have occurred. Of course, this
event of thievery did not occur in matters of the block chain, but rather that of the personal
information and database resources.
Basically, our mission is providing flexibility to the users, as well as all around the world to
reducing their time consumptions with secure and efficient system with advance features.
The requirements for the project are to development of a system that has a secure access to all
users  to  avail  the  all  functionality  provided  by  AlibabaCoin  foundation.  User  requires
implementing different features related to how to use ABBC wallet. The Alibabacoin System is
4
Alibabacoin Foundation




intended to replace the manual model of user’s registration for wallet record keeping by means
paper records. The registration and paper records are replaced with a single interaction between
the users and the Alibabacoin Foundation. Users will be able to view their all ABBC coins
including buying selling and online shopping by a secure Alibabacoin wallet. The features
expressed in this white paper document are intended to be fully implemented.
Although technology is rapidly changing almost at the speed of light, most of the Crypto
currencies are still using manual management system, these Crypto currencies management,
share ideas and passing of information, are done manually hence providing:
•   Providing untimely assessment information.
•   Consume a lot of time.
•   Waste and use lots of resource forms.
•   Difficulty of searching and retrieving records.
•   Security issues.
•   Frudentlants.
•   Sacmes.
The manual handling of the cryptocurrency system has always been a difficult task and less
secure, so the sub-objective is to identify the requirement and design the Digital currency system
that will resolve the above problem of manual system, by designing and implementing the
proposed system successfully and securely.

Introduction:
Since the birth of Bitcoin, crypto 1.0 has been the most influential and most dominant format of
cryptocurrency in the market for a very long time. However, new algorithm formats of encoding
have become the new kids on the block and has started to dominate the market, threatening the
position of the world’s first and biggest coin. We have searched for the best format to use for our
new payment solution, and have chosen the X13 Format:
7
Alibabacoin Foundation




1. X 13 Algorithm:
X13 is one of the most modern hashing algorithm models in the market. It uses 13 rounds of
hashing with 13 different hash functions such as “bmw, blake, groestl, jh, keccak, skein, luffa,
cubhash” etc. This unique function allows the algorithm to be one of the most reliable and safe
crypto-currencies in the world.
Bitcoin’s inception in 2009 many
newcomers have emerged, and we
call them altcoins today. They all
share the same basic principles of
Bitcoin,  but  have  different  PoW
algorithms,   different   difficulty
adjustment  mechanisms,  different
amount  of  coins  generated  per
block  and  different  number  of
supply. Bitcoin along with altcoins
form  the  cryptocurrency  market
where they can be exchanged into the usual fiat currencies. However, a bulk of altcoins where
conceived with the aim to improve the limitations and weaknesses of Bitcoin. A major weakness
of Bitcoin is the fact that its PoW algorithm is based on SHA-256 and makes it therefore
vulnerable to ASIC miners. Litecoin was the first altcoin to be ASIC  (Application Specific
Integrated Circuits) resistant by making use of Scrypt as PoW algorithm. It ought to be resistant,
but in 2014 the first Scrypt ASIC miners were released. After that people tried to further improve
the Scrypt algorithm in order to make it again resistant. Algorithms such as NeoScrypt, Scrypt-
Adaptive-N-factor (Scrypt-N) and Scrypt-Jane (Scrypt-Chachacha) emerged. These algorithms
claim to be more memory intensive than Scrypt. With the release of Dash, a new ASIC resistant
PoW algorithm was released as well. This algorithm was called X11. X11 uses a combination of
eleven hashing algorithms in series in order to be resistant. However, X11 has also been
superseded by ASICs and successors combining thirteen hashing algorithms in series (X13) and
recently even fifteen hashing algorithms in series (X15) had emerged.
8
Alibabacoin Foundation




Obviously combining more and more different hashing algorithms in series will not make it
more resistant but will solely make it more inefficient to mine.
There is a large number of cryptocurrencies using the Scrypt PoW algorithm as well as,
probably due to legacy reasons, another large number of cryptocurrencies is still using the SHA-
256 PoW algorithm. In the beginning, 1st generation cryptocurrencies could only be mined using
CPUs and the power consumption was very high. Afterwards 2nd generation cryptos started
using GPUs for mining purposes as they achieved faster speeds with lower power consumption
but  still  comparably  high.  Then,                                                                3rd  generation  newcomers  started  using  FPGAs   (Field
Programmable  Gate  Arrays)  in  order  to  mine  cryptocurrencies  at  higher  speeds.  FPGAs
decreased the power consumption quite substantially making the mining of cryptocurrencies
truly profitable. However, as more people joined, the profitability went down and the  4th
generation of miners followed, namely ASICs. ASICs are dedicated miners with the purpose of
decreasing the costs of mining and in particular power consumption many times. Thus, the
process of mining coins started out with the use of software solutions and evolved further to the
use of hardware solutions due to the steadily rising demand for higher speeds. The increase of
hardware solutions has initiated the development of memory hard PoW algorithms, such as
CryptoNight and Ethash. Nowadays all PoW algorithms are supported by CPU and GPU miners,
whereas the support for ASIC miners is currently solely available to PoW algorithms with a large
number of cryptocurrencies i.e. SHA-256, Scrypt and X13. This however does not mean that
other PoW algorithms are resistant to ASIC miners but are simply currently not available for sale
as the demand is just too low. Support is theoretically possible as some of the PoW algorithms
are not memory bound whereas this is currently the only limitation of ASIC miners.

X13 uses both POS and POW methods of mining, and is quite easy to utilize the algorithm for
mining. Mining is often thought of as the way to create new coins. But that is just a secondary
purpose. The primary importance of mining is to ensure that all participants have a consistent
view of the data. As cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, consist of a distributed peer-to-peer
system, there is no central database that keeps track of who owns how many coins. Instead, the
log of all transactions is distributed across the network. The main problem with a distributed
transaction log is to avoid inconsistencies that could allow someone to spend the same coins
twice. The solution is to mine the outstanding transactions into a block, which makes the
transactions official. Conflicting or invalid transactions are not allowed into a block, so the
double-spending problem is avoided. Although mining transactions into blocks avoids double-
spending, it raises new problems: What stops people from randomly mining blocks? How do you
decide who gets to mine a block? How does the network agree on which blocks are valid?
Solving those problems is the key innovation. Background of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin.
Cryptocurrencies usually solve these problems by making mining of new coins very difficult
through a technique called proof-of-work (PoW). PoW used to be an economic measure to deter
denial of service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some
work from the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer. A key feature
of PoW is the asymmetry: the work must be moderately hard (but feasible) on the requester side
but easy to check for the service provider. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies borrow their PoW
system from “Hashcash”. Hashcash is a PoW system that was used to limit email spam and
denial-of-service attacks and that was proposed in May 1997 by Adam Back. It uses partial hash
inversions to prove that work was done, as a good-will token to send an e-mail. The sender is
required to find a message whose hash value begins with a certain number of zero bits. The
average work that a sender needs to perform in order to find a valid message is exponential in the
number of zero bits required in the hash value, while the recipient can verify the validity of the
message by executing a single hash function. Bitcoin for instance, uses a cryptography hash
function called double SHA-256. This hash function takes a chunk of data as input and shrinks it
down into a smaller 256 bits hash value. With cryptographic hash functions, there is no other
way to get a desired hash value, without trying a whole lot of different inputs. In more detail, to
mine a block in Bitcoin, the miner first has to build the block header. The block header contains
a handful of fields that describe the block. The first field being the protocol version and the
10
Alibabacoin Foundation




second field being the hash of the previous block in the blockchain, which ensures that all the
blocks form an unbroken sequence in the blockchain. The next field is the Merkle root, a special
hash of all the transactions that should go into the block. The first transaction is the special
“coinbase” transaction, which grants the mining reward to the miner. The remaining transactions
are standard Bitcoin transactions moving Bitcoins around. The Merkle root is also a key part of
Bitcoin’s security, since it ensures that transactions cannot be changed once they are part of a
block. The next fields consist of a moderately accurate timestamp of the block, followed by the
mining difficulty value. This value changes according to the hash rate of the whole network, in
order to keep a consistent generation of Bitcoins. The last field is called the nonce. The nonce is
an arbitrary value that is incremented on each hash attempt in order to provide a new hash value.
The tricky part of mining is to find a nonce that works. After the block header is built, the miner
hashes the block to form a 256-bit block hash value. If the hash starts with enough zeros, the
block has been successfully mined, whereas it is sent to the Bitcoin network and the hash
becomes the identifier of the block. However, most of the time the hash is not successful, so the
miner keeps incrementing the nonce value contained in the block header and tries again, over and
over, billions of times. Eventually the miner will successfully mine a block and the process starts
over. It takes a tremendously huge amount of computational effort to mine a block, but it is very
easy for peers on the network to verify that a block has been successfully mined. The difficulty
and competitiveness of mining is a key part of Bitcoin’s security, since it ensures that nobody
can flood the system with bad blocks. Each mined block references the previous block, forming
an unbroken chain back to the first block called the “genesis” block. This chain of blocks, also
called the “blockchain”, ensures that everyone agrees on the transaction record. It also ensures
that nobody can tamper with blocks in the chain since re-mining all the following blocks would
be computationally infeasible. As long as nobody has more than half of the computational
resources, mining remains competitive and nobody can control the blockchain.

Related Work:
Bitcoin.  Bitcoin  is  a  digital  currency that  relies  on  cryptography,  also  denoted  as
cryptocurrency, that finally provides an elegant solution to the problem of requiring a trusted
third party. It broadcasts and agrees on transactions through a peer-to-peer network in order to
prevent doublespending. The design paper was published under a pseudonym called “Satoshi
Nakamoto” in 2008. In more detail, Bitcoin relies on digital signatures to prove ownership and
on a public history of transactions to prevent double-spending. The history of transactions is
shared using a peer-to-peer network and is agreed upon using a proof-of-work system. The legal
status of Bitcoin varies from country to country. It is banned in some parts of the world, but the
reception is in general positive. Bitcoin is nowadays accepted by major companies, such as
Microsoft, as a currency for online purchases. Currently more than 16.000.000 Bitcoins were
generated and the exchange rate is 10,450.60 USD for one Bitcoin. Bitcoin is comprised of about
5.252 servers and the estimated number of clients is 200.0002 . Bitcoin’s pseudonymity comes
from the fact that users of the system are identified by Bitcoin addresses which are essentially
hashes of public keys. Each user can create locally as many public keys as he or she wants.
Bitcoin is an electronic analog of cash in the online world. It is decentralized: there is no central
authority responsible for the issuance of Bitcoins and there is no need to involve a trusted third
party when making online transfers. However, this flexibility comes at a price: the entire history
of Bitcoin transactions is publicly available which makes it vulnerable to de-anonymization
attacks.

SOCIAL CONTRIBUTION:
ABBC is fundamentally operated by the Foundation with the aim of social contribution
and donation. It supports the Foundation’s capabilities in war, hunger, and medical care. Block-
chain technology also applies to the structure of donations, allowing diverse people, society, and
organizations to support them through ABBC.
GLOBAL PAYMENT:
Nationwide and global companies, all the way down to small-shop operators, tend to use
private and centralized software systems and solutions. Banks and the modern financial system is
a perfect example. If I want to send you money, I have to go through a bank in order to verify the
transaction the bank being the “centralized” hub for verification. But through the blockchain, the
very building blocks that power cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, that centralized
entity no longer has a purpose. It doesn’t have a job. There is no need for its services because the
blockchain does the verification automatically. Alibabacoin Foundation is currently preparing an
15

online shopping and a crypto exchange business that will combine all platforms and enable them
to use a more facilitated payment structure and a more safe method to keep and distribute
cryptos.
ECONOMIC GROWTH:
Cryptocurrencies   is not going to replace any major currency or central bank anytime
soon. It will definitely serve as alternate currency/asset for a long time. It encompasses all
activity related to production, consumption and trade of goods and services in a country. So to
trade you need a convenient medium of exchange that is currency and to issue a currency you
need a trusted party like government and central bank. That’s where Bitcoin is challenging the
traditional methods. Alibabacoin wants to serve as one of the best asset in real time economic
growth in a long progress in all aspects.
CHARITY:
ABBC  is  a non-profit  foundation  created  for  a purpose to  enhance the blockchain
technology and to share the financial benefits to all parts of the world. We start with our local
societies.  ABBC  Foundation  is  located  in  Dubai,  and  we  are  willing  to  find  places  and

HTML5:
This version of markup hypertext language has latest feature for user including easy
video streaming everything is latest maximum browser are supported by this version.
HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images so that your Internet browser may
display them as they are intended to look. Without HTML, a browser would not know how to
display text as elements or load images or other elements. HTML also provides a basic structure
of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance. One could
think of HTML as the bones (structure) of a web page, and CSS as its skin (appearance).

What is HTML5?
HTML5 is the update made to HTML from HTML4  (XHTML follows a different version
numbering scheme). It uses the same basic rules as HTML4, but adds some new tags and
attributes which allow for better semantics and for dynamic elements that are activated using
                                                                                                  JavaScript.  New  elements  include  section,                                                                    <article>,      <aside>,              <audio>,    <bdi>,   <canvas>,

<mark>, <meter>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <rp>, <rt>, <ruby>, <time>, <track>, <video>,
and <wbr>. There are also new input types for forms, which include tel, search, url, email,
datetime, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, and color.

With the increasing movement to keep structure and style separate, a number of styling elements
have been removed along with those that had accessibility issues or saw very little use. These
following elements should no longer be used in HTML code: <acronym>, <applet>, <basefont>,
<big>, <center>, <dir>, <font>, <frame>, <frameset>, <noframes>, <strike>, and <tt>. HTML5
also simplifies the doctype declaration to the tag in the following box.
<!doctype html>
CSS3:
CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and
fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens,
small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based
markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share
style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments.
How Css looks Like?
The following very simple example of a portion of an HTML document illustrates how to create
a link within a paragraph. When rendered on the screen (or by a speech synthesizer), the link text
will be “final report”; when somebody activates the link, the browser will retrieve the resource
identified by “http://www.example.com/report”:
<p class="moreinfo">For more information see the
<a href="http://www.example.com/report">final report</a>.</p>
The class attribute on the paragraph's start tag (“<p>”) can be used, among other thing, to add
style. For instance, to italicize the text of all paragraphs with a class of “moreinfo,” one could
write, in CSS:
p.moreinfo { font-style: italic }
By placing that rule in a separate file, the style may be shared by any number of HTML
documents.

PHP:
PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a powerful and widely-used open source server-
side scripting language to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP scripts are executed on
the server and the result is sent to the browser as plain HTML.
PHP can be integrated with the number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL,
Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.
What You Can Do with PHP?
•   There are lot more things you can do with PHP.
•   You can generate dynamic pages and files.
•   You can create, open, read, write and close files on the server.
                                                                                                •   You can collect data from a web form such as user information,   email,   credit   card
information and much more.
•   You can send emails to the users of your website.
•   You can send and receive cookies to track the visitor of your website.
•   You can store, delete, and modify information in your database.
•   You can restrict unauthorized access to your website.
•   You can encrypt data for safe transmission over internet.

Perl:
Perl is a family of script programming languages that are similar in syntax to the C language,
including Perl 5 and Perl 6. Perl is an open source, general-use, interpreted language.
In general, Perl is easier to learn and faster to code in than the more structured C and C++
languages. Perl programs can, however, be quite sophisticated. It is often used for developing
common gateway interface  (CGI) programs because it has good text manipulation facilities,
although it also handles binary files.
Perl includes a number of popular UNIX facilities such as sed, awk, and tr. It can be compiled
just before execution into either C code or cross-platform bytecode. When compiled, a Perl
program is almost as fast as a fully precompiled C language program. A plug-in can be installed
for some servers, such as Apache, so that Perl is loaded permanently in memory, thus reducing
compile time and resulting in faster execution of CGI Perl scripts.
The first version of Perl was created in  1987 by programmer Larry Wall. The name was
originally said to stand for "Practical Extraction and Reporting Language," but that name is no
longer used. Wall prefers the usage of an upper-case "Perl" for the language itself and lower-case
"perl" for any interpreter or compiler of Perl.
As of May 2017, Perl is in its fifth release, Perl 5, which was first made available in 1994. The
current version is 5.24, released in May 2016
What perl look like?
# Prints the message using two different delimeters.
print "Hello, world!\n";
print qq=Did you say "Hello?"\n=;

Project characteristics:
Following are the characteristics of our project that distinguish it from other projects in
other word s this project are highly:-
Maintainable:
changes can be made to satisfy new requirements or to correct deficiencies.
This applies especially to the architecture, the "big picture". And our project will be more flexible
and more familiar
Correct:
This project adheres to its specified requirements
Reusable:
This project can be reused in developing other software.we adding module that will be used in
the code again and again because if we want to write one type of module more then one time we
should reuse the code as we write it before we don’t need to write code again and again .
Reliable:
The frequency and criticality of software failure, where failure is an unacceptable effect or
behavior  occurring  under  permissible  operating  conditions.                                         Repeatable  processes  reduce
variability  through  measurement  and  constant  process  correction.  The  term  originated  in
manufacturing, where results were well defined and repeatability meant that if a process had
consistent inputs, then defined outputs would be produced. Repeatable means that the conversion
of inputs to outputs can be replicated with little variation. It implies that no new information can
be generated during the process because we have to know all the information in advance to
predict  the  output  results  accurately.  Repeatable  processes  are  not  effective  for  product
development projects because precise results are rarely predictable, inputs vary considerably
from project to project, and the input-to-output conversions themselves are highly variable
Reliable processes focus on outputs, not inputs. Using a reliable process, team members figure
out ways to consistently achieve a given goal even though the inputs vary dramatically. Because
31
Alibabacoin Foundation




of the input variations, the team may not use the same processes or practices from one project, or
even one iteration, to the next. Reliability is results driven. Repeatability is input driven. The
irony is that if every project process was somehow made repeatable, the project would be
extremely unstable because of input and transformation variations. Even those organizations that
purport to have repeatable processes are often successful not because of those processes, but
because of the adaptability of the people who are using those processes
Portable:
This can be easily using on computer configurations other than its current one.                      Onepoint is a java
app, which raises some portability issues for the purists. However, it appears to be a great
candidate for the PortableApps treatment. I am using Onepoint regularly from my USB stick
with no issues. It appears to be very portable natively. The visual look and feel of this app is
streets ahead of the other open source project managers - and the software is robust and very
functional. This app is highly recommended as a "must try" for anyone interested in project
management software. It can import MS Project files
Efficient:
The degree of our ABBC project fulfills its purpose without waste of resources.
7 Habits of Highly Effective Project
•                                                                                                    Be A Proactive Project Manager:
The “accidental” project manager is someone who has come up through the ranks and may have
been picked to lead a project due to their vast technical experience, but not their people
management expertise. For example, a strong network technician may be asked to head up the
network upgrade because he understands the system better than anyone else. These people may
fall into the role with a lot of specific project knowledge, but they may struggle with branching
into the team-building, management category of the work.
The “good” project manager is someone who handles both the knowledge and management
portions of the business well, but they tend to be more reactive than proactive in their approach.

They do what is expected, but no more. They follow the rules, but don’t create new innovative
venues to do things better
•                                                                                                     Begin with the End in Mind
In project management, as with anything, it is easy to go into analysis paralysis. When multiple
people take a project, and break it down into pieces of their own real estate, it sometimes can get
difficult to stay focused on the final picture. Everyone’s work must come together in the end.
Egos must be set aside for the greater congruency of the overall picture. It is much easier to work
together when everyone is focused on the final team outcome, not on stealing the spotlight and
looking like a rock star.
•                                                                                                     Put First Things First
Covey says to always do your big rocks - your most impactful, important things - first. This
means, you don’t allow little distractions and rabbit trails to take away your focus from the
main areas in your project.

platform with its own trading or wallet service platform and its own internal Blockchain service
which is also known as a Peer to Peer network that is allowing development of complex
applications in its own scripting language (which is similar to Java).
The use of Ethereum Blockchain smart contracts is limited only to critical functionality and
utilizes the ERC 20 Blockchain.
Smart Feature of this platform:
The best identifiable system is implemented using 3 keys:
User open key -users to get open information about the user;
User private key -We can say that the private key is sharable key to each user, stored in
browser local storage and used for sharing money apart to use private key on runtime user
identification by the front-end;
User fingertip -That is smart secure feature which you can use during transaction when it
was ask pin or fingerprint. That is used by the back-end and internode communication.
Users may choose to provide full identification or remain anonymous. In addition to the existing
ID system, we are planning to use Key base and other identity systems later, once they become
available.

Improved Proof-of-Stake Algorithm:
Proof of Stake (PoS) is a method of securing a Cryptocurrency network that relies upon users
showing ownership of coins in order to sign blocks. In the long run, the probability of signing
blocks is proportional to the amount of coins owned, someone owning 1% of total coin supply
will be able to sign 1% of all proof of stake blocks. Compared to proof of work approach, proof
of stake requires significantly less computational power, and thus less energy usage.
Coin Age and Linear Proof-of-Stake:
Linear Proof-of-Stake designs have attracted criticism in relation to Coin Age. Many argue that
linear Proof-of-Stake encourages hoarding of coins (which can have a detrimental effect on trade
and transfer volume) Fundamental to most implementations of Proof of Stake, including that of
ALIBABACOIN, is the concept of Coin Age. Essentially, this is a measure of how long a coin
36
Alibabacoin Foundation




holder has held onto coins without spending or moving them. Another valid complaint against
linear Proof-of-Stake relates to the effect it can have on network security. Linear Proof-of-Stake
implementations often suffer due to users periodically connecting to the Cloak network to stake
their coins and then disconnecting once all Coin Age has been destroyed.
From the time a transaction is completed, coins that were part of that transaction begin to
accumulate Coin Age (which starts at zero). The user then waits until Coin Age has replenished
before repeating the connect-stake-disconnect process. This does not provide the best security for
the network, and a Proof-of-Stake algorithm that rewards frequent or constant staking would be
most beneficial to ALIBABACOIN and related Proof-of-Stake currencies. To ensure Enigma
ABBC are rewarded as amply as possible, Coin Age should be removed from ABBC Proof-of-
Stake algorithm. This would ensure that ABBC receive both the full staking reward and any
Enigma ALIBABACOIN rewards. The additional incorporation of a velocity component in
calculating staking rewards would further reward active Enigma coin nodes. In addition to
providing greater rewards to actively participating users, an improved Proof-of-Stake algorithm
also provides the aforementioned improvements to network security.

Proof of Work:
Consider ALIBABACOIN as an example of a cryptocurrency system secured with a proof of
work algorithm. Each block in ALIBABACOIN consists of two parts:
➢  Block header of key parameters, including block creation time, reference to the previous
block and the Markel tree root of the block of transactions
➢  Block list of transactions. To reference a specific block, its header is hashed twice with
the SHA-256 function; the resulting integer value belongs to the interval [0, 2 256 − 1].
41
Alibabacoin Foundation




To account for different possible implementations, we will use a generic hashing function
hash (•) with a variable number of arguments and range [0, M].
For example, arguments of the function can be treated as binary strings and merged together to
form a single argument that can be passed to the SHA-256 hashing function. The block reference
is used in the proof of work protocol; in order for a block to be considered valid, its reference
must not exceed a certain threshold:
Hash(B) ⩽ M/D, (1) where D ∈ [1, M] is the target difficulty.
There is no known way to find B satisfying other than iterating through all possible variables in
the block header repeatedly. The higher the value of D, the more iterations are needed to find a
valid block; the expected number of operations is exactly D. The time period T(r) for a miner
with hardware capable of performing r operations per second to find a valid block is distributed
exponentially with the rate r/D (see Appendix A):
P{T(r) ⩽ t} = 1 − exp(−rt/D). Consider n ALIBABACOIN miners with hash rates r1, r2, …,rn.
The period of time to find a block T is equal to the minimum value of random variables T(ri)
assuming that the miner publishes a found block and - 5 - it reaches other miners immediately.
According to the properties of the exponential distribution, T is also distributed exponentially:
P{T def = min(T1, . . . , Tn) ⩽ t} = 1 -exp( − t D ∑n i=1 ri ) ; P{T = Ti} = ∑ ri n j=1 rj .
The last equation shows that the mining is fair: a miner with a share of mining power p has the
same probability p to solve a block before other miners. It can be shown that proof of work as
used in ALIBABACOIN satisfies Conditions.

Proof of Stake:
In proof of stake algorithms, inequality is modified to depend on the user’s ownership of the
particular Proof-of-Stack protocol cryptocurrency and not on block properties. Consider a user
with address A and balance bal(A). A commonly used proof of stake algorithm uses a condition
as hash(hash(Bprev), A, t) ⩽bal(A)M/D, where • Bprev denotes the block the user is building on,
•t is the current UTC timestamp. For various reasons, some cryptocurrencies use modified
versions of which we discuss in the corresponding sections
Unlike the only variable that the user can change is the timestamp t in the left part of the
equation the address balance is locked by the protocol; e.g., the protocol may calculate the
balance based on funds that did not move for a day.

Alternatively,  a  Proof-of-stake  crypto  currency  may  use  unspent  transaction  outputs  as
ALIBABACOIN does; in this case, the balance is naturally locked. A proof of stake protocol
puts restrictions on possible values of t.
For example, if it must not differ from the UTC time on network nodes by more than an hour,
then  a  user  can  attempt  no  more  than                                                           7200  values  of  t.  Thus,  there  are  no  expensive
computations involved in the proof of stake. Together with an address A and a timestamp t
satisfying, a user must provide a proof of ownership of the address. To achieve this, the user can
sign the newly minted block with his signature; in order to produce a valid signature, one must
have a private key corresponding to the address A. The time to find a block for address A is
exponentially  distributed  with  rate  ball                                                          (A)/D                                                    (see  Appendix  A).  Consequently,  the
implementation of proof of stake is fair: the probability to generate a valid block is equal to the
ratio of user’s balance of funds to the total amount of currency in circulation. The time to find a
block for the entire network is distributed exponentially with rate ∑ a ball (a)/D.
There is selfish mining attack that is based on hiding mined blocks. We don’t consider it here
and assume that all miners are honest. Thus, if the monetary supply of the currency ∑ a bal(a) is
fixed or grows at a predictable rate, the difficulty D should be known in advance: D = 1 Tex ∑ a
bal (a), with Tex denoting the expected time between blocks. In practice, D needs to be adjusted
based on recent blocks because not all currency owners participate in block minting.
Consensus in a decentralized digital currency like ALIBABACOIN is achieved by requiring
generated  blocks  to  contain  a  proof  that  the  node  which  generated  the  block  solved  a
computational hard task. Unfortunately, the concept of the Proof-of-Work (Proof-of-work) the
based system tends to lean towards eventual self-destruction. Proof-of-stake  (Proof-of-stack)
aims to replace the way of achieving the consensus in a distributed system; instead of solving the
Proof-of-Work, the node which generates a block has to provide a proof that it has access to a
certain amount of coins before being accepted by the network. Generating a block involves
sending coins to oneself, which proves the ownership. The required amount of coins (also called
target) is specified by the network through a difficult adjustment process similar to Proof-of-
work  that  ensures  an  approximate,  constant  block  time.  As  in  Proof-of-work,  the  block
44

generation process will be rewarded through transaction fees and a supply model specified by the
underlying protocol; which can also be seen as interest rate by common definition. The initial
distribution of the currency is usually obtained through a period of Proof-of-work mining.
A. Related work:
The first Proof-of-Stack based currency was ALIBABACOIN. Which is still in a period of
Proof-of-work mining. Further development of the ALIBABACOIN Proof-of-System protocol
lead to Bitcoin which uses a hybrid Proof-of-Stack / Proof-of-System that uses a pure Proof-of-
stack a based protocol which is based on the development of the above described projects.

Market Adaptations:
Since the beginning of 2016, the total market capitalization of crypto currencies has increased
almost 14 times reaching 165 billion in early September 2017.
Alibabacoin Foundation is planning to create a shopping platform, as well as a new payment
solution and combine these two items to create a synergy in this new crypto market. Our solution
will provide a new paradigm for shopping culture as the payment solution itself will also raise in
price in such market conditions.
After  a  successful  creation  of  a  shopping  platform,  ALIBABACOIN  Foundation  will  be
developing and launching a self-oriented crypto exchange targeted for big hand users and crypto
specialists.  Our  services  will  be  combined  into  one  platform,  and  our  PC/Mobile  version
solutions will be able to be connected to the shopping and exchange service that will be provided
in the near future.

TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW
PC Web-Wallet:
POS and POW integrated wallet will be released in PC version. Mining in both CPU and GPU
will be available due to its hybrid algorithm format. In one sense online web wallet providers are
creating their own ecosystem - they are vertically integrated sometimes and offer both trading
and storage options - such as Coinbase. This raises the issue of anonymity as wallet holders and
exchanges generally are being pushed to hold documentation about users to combat AML and
KYC financial regulations - especially in America. This can mean that at the simple request of
the US Government a full list of personal information can be obtained - cryptocurrencies are not
so anonymous.
Mobile wallet:
Alibabacoin Foundation introducing the native Mobile wallet for the android and also for the ios
by this user can sell the coin, buy the coin and online shopping with the secure facial recognition
Algorithm X-13 to make it non-hackable. User can access the wallet by their face which is
uniquely identify by this algorithm as well as this Alibaba coin wallet which is user friendly.

Multi-Crypto Hard Wallet Solution (Manual)
One of our first to come milestone is the development of the multi-cryptocurrency HD
wallet.
Our HD wallet will allow facial recognition, multi-crypto storage function, pin code transaction
confirmation, crypto trading, online shopping mall connection, and also crypto payment.
AlibabaCoin will be accepting 7 types of crypto currencies in this exchange wallet platform. It
will work just like a crypto currency changer, a switching platform. Users will be able to switch
from one crypto to another in instant rates. Our wallets will allow users to control their own
private keys, and use proper APIs for each crypto according to global price in
www.coinmarketcap.com. It is most important that hard wallets allow each crypto holder to take
responsibility of their own assets in the proper way that the blockchain industry demands each
user to comply to. Our criteria will let the wallet users to learn faster, adapt quicker to the market
standards and to learn how to manage crypto assets wisely and safely in the most effective way
provided in the market.

If you first open the wallet app, the first page you will arrive at will be the main page. It is the
log in page for each one’s account. If you are a new user, you must create a new account in order
to create a proper wallet address and credit for usage. Click on “Register” and proceed with the
new account creation process as you fill in the required blanks for personal information. It
requires ID, Email Address, Password, Confirmation Code, and the Access Key.
Use any ID you wish, and unless it is used by another person, you can register as your unique
identity name. An email address is required in order to confirm the real user and for recovery
issues when you forget certain information for login. You will definitely need a password to
access into your account to use the wallet functions. Please create a password using a variety of
combinations of types of letters. A good model for a safe password is that which is hard to hack
or make duplicates. Recently, many platforms require types of passwords such as those with
capital letters, small letters, numbers, and symbols included all together in one password. Of
course, it is not easy to remember this; you must record it and keep it somewhere safe where you
can find it but also not get caught by someone else easily. When you click on the authentication
button next to the Confirm blank, you will receive an email including a 6-digit number. You
insert that number on the Access Key, and your registry will be complete.
If you forget your password and wish to recover it, insert your ID, email, and confirm access
key to retrieve lost password.

Alibabacoin Foundation




Once you log in properly, you will reach the Home Page with 6 circles around the center
Alibabacoin Logo. The top circle menu has the function of sending the coins to others through
blockchain. Once you click it, you can check your balance, and available amount of ABBC coins
you can transfer. On the Amount blank space, you can insert as much ABBC within available
amount according to balance. If you wish to send the entire amount, you can simply click on the
MAX button to insert automatically the full amount available. 0.02 ABBC will be deducted for
every transaction for system maintenance on the blockchain through mining system. The amount
shown on the Total will be the amount inserted + 0.002 ABBC.
52
Alibabacoin Foundation




There are some more options on the transaction page.
The Address button shows you your wallet address options. You can check the wallet address
and send your crypto assets via wallet address format. The QR Code button leads you to check
your own QR code format of the crypto wallet. This is a way to input complicated information in
an easy code form that can be recognized by the mobile device camera. The camera recognizes
the QR code and de-phrases the picture into the original information it intends to hold: the wallet
address. The Face Recognition button will allow the transaction to be confirmed using personal
face recognition, and this function will allow everyone to keep their assets safe by prohibiting
other people from stealing the funds. The facial recognition technology will still recognize your
face whether you change hairstyle, hair color, facial hair, different clothes, or other types of
changes in the appearance. The facial recognition function will recognize accurately the owner of
the crypto wallet by comparing the registered information embedded in the blockchain and allow
safe connection to the crypto wallet for further actions such as transactions or payment.
53
Alibabacoin Foundation




In case your facial information does not match the original registered information of the owner
of the wallet, the recognition confirmation will not proceed, and the person attempting to connect
to the wallet will not succeed. In order to change the facial recognition information from old to
new, you must enter the pre-inputted password that was set to reset the personal information
settings. After typing in the proper password for reset, the solution will ask for 5 different shots
of the facial pictures. The photos taken will be saved in the blockchain format to be compared in
order to verify the similarities of the instant physical appearance taken by the mobile device
camera. After taking a few photos for registry of main blockchain data, the Proceed button will
save the data and encrypt the data into the blockchain instead of saving it into the server, which
is the conventional way.
54
Alibabacoin Foundation




If you click on the Receive button, you can check your own crypto wallet in hash format as well
as in QR Code mode. You can check your balance on the top section just under My Amount. It
below that is the QR Code where you can show other people or take a screenshot to send to
others in order to receive crypto into your wallet. Under the QR code is your wallet address
where you can copy by dragging and sweeping the address itself, or pressing the Copy Address
button on the very bottom middle side of the page.

Let’s take a look at the Deposit button. If you click on this section, you can check your deposit,
or income into your crypto wallet. The deposit feature provides you 4 types of information;
address, TXid, quantity, and date. The Address shows the wallet address information of the
sender of a certain transaction so that you can check exactly you sent the crypto to your wallet.
TXid shows the transaction hash within the system, and you can always check the transaction
information via our ABBC explorer (abbcexplorer.com). Quantity will show how much ABBC
coins have been transferred up to the decimal point of 1/10million. Date will show the exact date
of the particular transaction according to the server time. The function will show 3 boxes with all
4 information included in each of them. To view more transactions, you must click on the bottom
page turner where you can choose which page to divert directly.
56
Alibabacoin Foundation




The Withdraw button function will allow you to check the output of coins in the same fashion as
the Deposit function. It will show Address, TXid, Quantity, and Date. 3 boxes will show, and the
page viewers will be presented as well on the bottom part of the page to jump directly to a
certain page number.

This is the function of the HD wallet that our foundation is developing. We will be dealing with
8 currencies: ABBC, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, Qtum, Bitcoin Cash, and Ripple. Your
account holder name will be shown on the top of the screen as well as your email and balance of
ABBC. Right below the balance, there is a searching function where you can type in and search
for a specific cryptocurrency within our list. We currently have 8, but this list will expand, and
you will have to search for the coin you are looking for when there will be more available coins
in the list. AlibabaCoin amount will be on the very top, and the rest of the coins will follow that
list. This page is just an overview so that you can check the balance of each coin you hold. If you
wish to convert any of the coin to another, you can click on the button with the calculator picture
that is written Convert.
60
Alibabacoin Foundation




Once you have reached the Covert page, you can see the changer option. The default setting of
the page is BTC on the first column and ABBC on the second column. If you click on the
columns, you can chose the specific type of crypto you would like to convert. The first column
shows the coins that you are holding, and that you wish to sell in order to switch to a new type of
coin. The second column is where you chose the new type of coin that you wish to purchase after
selling the coin on the first column. After you have chose each crypto, the calculation of
converting each coin will appear automatically. If you click on the circulation resembling button,
you can switch column 1 and 2, make the convert direction to the opposite. Below that, the
minimum deposit and maximum available deposit amount will be shown in order to show you
how much funds you will be capable of converting, the Instant Rate will show you the current
price for converting specific types of coins to another.
61
Alibabacoin Foundation




While you are thinking of converting a certain coin to another, you will want to search for some
information concerning technology, or even price, or any possible news or accouncement of the
coin that you would like to chose. If you click on Bitcoin for instance, you will be sent to a page
showing the Logo picture of the cryptocurrency, the coin symbol, and the current price according
to www.coinmarketcap.com. It will also show Marketcap in USD, trade volume, circulating
supply amount, and also the maximum available supply of the coin. If you click on the Go to
Website button, you can directly connect to Bitcoin webpage and check on crucial information or
notices on the website. This will be available on all cryptos registered on our wallet list.

Face Recognition Technology
Facial recognition is a category of biometric software that maps an individual's facial
features mathematically and stores the data as a faceprint. The software uses deep learning
algorithms to compare a live capture or digital image to the stored faceprint in order to verify an
individual's identity.
The phone's software, which is designed with 3-D modeling to resist being spoofed by
photos or masks, captures and compares over 30,000 variables. As of this writing, Face ID can
be used to authenticate purchases with Apple Pay and in the iTunes Store, App Store and iBooks
Store. Apple encrypts and stores faceprint data in the cloud, but authentication takes place
directly on the device.
An image analysis service that's part of the Amazon AI suite, to add facial recognition
and analysis features to an application. Alibaba-Coin-Wallet provides a similar capability with
its Google Cloud Vision API. The technology, which uses machine learning to detect, match and
identify faces, is being used in a wide variety of ways, including entertainment and marketing.
64
Alibabacoin Foundation




Paying With Your Face
Facial recognition technology has been speculated all over the world for decades, but
only has  it  been  in  recent  years  that  this  technology has  become  accurate  enough  to  be
implemented in financial business or criminal investigations. There have some firms in China
that have published business presentations introducing new facial recognition technology, and
we will soon find more advanced models all around the world sooner or later.
The new AlibabaCoin’s blockchain technology will use artificial-intelligence techniques
effective for image recognition most reliably to identify a person most accurately as possible,
and use this technique effectively for the structure of payment of electronic wallets and financial
transactions.
65
Alibabacoin Foundation




Breakthrough:
Face recognition technology that is finally accurate enough to be widely used in financial
transactions and other everyday applications. Like
•   Online shopping
•   Deposit money
•   Withdraw money
•   Make more secure transaction
•   Send money
•   Exchange ABBC crypto coin with other crypto coins (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)
•   Supporting various online shopping platforms (Amazon, Alibaba.com, eBay, etc.)
The AlibabaCoin blockchain technology offers a secure and extremely convenient method of
payment without raising privacy concerns.

Multi-Crypto Wallet
We are currently developing a multi-crypto wallet that will be combined with the payment
solution shown above. Our platform users will be able to store more than 5 types of crypto-
currencies, and will also be able to be switched with each other.
Our Wallets will support X13 as well as SHA256 algorithms which all fall to the simple
function using the BIP 32 Tree. (Picture)

Alibabacoin Foundation




HD wallets generate a hierarchical tree-like structure of keys which start from the seed master
key based on BIP 32. The wallet goes ahead and drives all the private keys of the tree using BIP
32. This way, our HD-type wallet using a one-way SHA-256 hash algorithm will produce this
tree of keys without any error if the input (or seed key) is the same.
Shopping
We have a big database and
infrastructure   prepared   for
the  present  online  market.
We know what people want
and how to deliver it to them.
The only problem we had was that we were not able to unify the payment solution because of fiat
currency differences and regulations problems in each country. With AlibabaCoin, we can
integrate all fiat currencies and allow the world to pay in one unified crypto and make global
payment easier than ever.
With our own shopping platform, and our own shopping payment solution, we can create
synergy and make a new paradigm in online shopping. Our target is to combine country to
countries, such as China, France, Korea, Germany, Japan, and many more international countries
that are participating in crypto markets as well as online shopping industries.
Using a decentralized coin in order to purchase certain items, not going through a bank to
achieve something you wish, this value will create a big trend and allow crypto to develop more
fast and big than ever. Shopping Platforms expected to be implemented in the near future:

platform currently.Last but not least and i want to highlight something to all NEO owners,
83
Alibabacoin Foundation




Binance will somehow assist in the value of NEO in the coming 10days or so due to the opening
up of accessibility for NEO. ( Another bumpy ride to come very soon ) Hold on NEOer's !

GEMINI:
Gemini is a digital currency exchanger started by the Winklevoss twins in 2015.In June
2016, according to CNBC report, Gemini became the world's first licensed ether exchange. It has
begun operations in Canada and U.K.Primary competitors include Coinbase, Bitstamp and
Kraken. All enable users to trade cryptocurrency and fiat currency on an open market, at a
moderate cost; transfers to banks are also possible. The operation began in order to facilitate
buying Bitcoin and storing it safely in a password-protected site with a complex system of
private keys for protection. As an added measure, only a small percentage of the Bitcoin is held
online, with the majority offline to minimize the risk of loss from hacking. Nonetheless, experts
recommend holding cryptocurrencies offline in a Wallet and not on an exchange. The site Profit
Confidential addressed this issue as follows:To be perfectly honest, there is no yes or no answer
to the “Are Ethereum exchanges safe” question. Going purely on past records, they are safe
though exchanges like Poloniex have been hacked. This does not make Poloniex any less safe
than  the  others.  People  who  hack  exchanges  are  constantly upgrading their  methods,  and
likewise, the exchanges are trying to stay a step ahead. The best bet is to use offline storage of
ETHs once the transaction is complete. Gemini is one of the few trusted by Ari Paul of the hedge
fund BlockTower Capital which deals in virtual currency. In mid December 2017, Gemini was
one of the exchanges used by Cboe Global Markets "as the basis for the daily settlement for the
bitcoin futures that began trading this week", according to a report by Bloomberg News for
Fortune (magazine).
LIQUI:
Liqui, found online at Liqui.io, is a cryptocurrency exchange with particularly strong
liquidity in Ethereum and other altcoins - including MGO, BAT, VSL, and ROUND.At the time
of writing, Liqui was sitting at the 28th spot in terms of 24 hour trading volume, with about
$10,000,000 of trading volume over a 24 hour period. That puts in between exchanges like
CEX.io, Gatehub, OkCoin, and Gatecoin in terms of trading volume.The exchange was launched
in 2016. You can read the official launch announcement at the BitcoinTalk forums here.What
makes Liqui different from the dozens of other exchanges? One of the advantages is that Liqui
85
Alibabacoin Foundation




has a savings account where you can earn a 24% annual percent rate (APR). Interest is paid
every 24 hours, and you can withdraw your funds at any time. Obviously, there’s a catch to this
24% APR: you can only deposit a certain amount of money into the Liqui savings account. Your
allowable amount is based on your Liqui trading volume. At the time of writing, Liqui had a
limit of 300 BTC. Liqui is clearly a unique concept compared to other cryptocurrency exchanges.

choice for European users, but after a number of acquisitions in the last couple of years, their
focus seems to be shifting from Europe to Worldwide market. kraken-cover.
The verification process is straightforward, but Kraken can be a bit strict when it comes
to the higher tier verifications. There are four tiers. Tier 1 and 2 take only a few minutes, but it
can take longer if the application requires manual review. Tier 3 verification usually takes a
couple of days to complete.Kraken doesn’t allow deposits, withdrawals or trading without

higher than Tier 2. Tier 3 verification also allows margin trading. The verification requires:

UPBIT:
Upbit is a new Korean cryptocurrency exchange. The exchange was launched by Korea’s biggest
messaging app developer, Kakao. At launch, the platform will offer trading of 111 altcoins.
The exchange was announced on September 27, soon after Korea passed China in terms of total
bitcoin trading volume.
There’s a reason Upbit’s upcoming launch is a big deal. Kakao Corp is more than just an internet
giant. The company’s Kakao Talk app is Korea’s most popular messaging app by far. Kakao also
offers Korea’s second most popular search engine, Daum, which sits just behind Naver in terms
of overall volume.
Other services offered by Kakao include a taxi app similar to Uber, a music streaming service, a
YouTube-like video sharing platform, and a popular mobile gaming network.
The company also offers Kakao Pay, which is the second largest mobile payment system in
South Korea behind only Samsung Pay.
To launch Upbit, Kakao Corp teamed up with American exchange Bittrex, which is one of the
world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges.
Another unique feature of Upbit is the ability to trade currencies via the Kakao Stock platform,
which is built on the Kakao Talk messenger. That means Korean cryptocurrency users will be
able to trade cryptocurrencies as easily as they use the Kakao Talk messenger app.
How Does Upbit Work?
Upbit is expected to offer functionality similar to Kakao Stock. Users will be able to interact
with the platform over their mobile device, similar to how they already interact with Kakao
Stock.
During the initial Upbit launch, the platform will mostly handle bitcoin and major altcoins - like
Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.
However, the ultimate goal of Upbit is to allow trading of 111 different cryptocurrencies from
167 different markets. They also plan to be South Korea’s largest digital currency exchange,
surpassing existing exchanges like Bithumb, which typically sits in the top  5 in terms of
worldwide trading volume.
Upbit will be available for iOS and Android. Users will also be able to access it on desktop
computers through any standard web browserIn addition to offering cryptocurrency trading
89
Alibabacoin Foundation




services through an exchange, Upbit will give users coin investment guides, altcoin analysis
information, and other information.
There will also be an internal Bitgo wallet available to users. Plus, users can use Kakao Pay - the
mobile payment solution created by Kakao - for added security.
What Does South Korea’s Government Think Of Bitcoin?
China’s cryptocurrency market was exploding with growth until the government essentially shut
it down. Could South Korea’s government take a similar approach?
So far, the government has seemed happy to allow bitcoin pioneers to operate. However, the
Korea Fair Trade Commission has recently decided to introduce legislation to the marketplace.
They’ve adjusted digital and financial laws, for example, to accommodate bitcoin. They’ve also
introduced bitcoin-specific anti-money laundering amendments to existing acts of parliament.
Both of these decisions came as a shock to bitcoin users in the country.
Regulars have also indicated they will “punish” certain types of initial coin offerings, or ICOs,
although it’s not clear if they plan to ban ICOs outright.
Another thing investors need to know about the future of South Korean bitcoin is that there are
some reports that the Korean Communications Commission and the Ministry of Science and ICT
will begin on-site inspections at bitcoin exchanges in South Korea. However, these reports have
not yet been confirmed.
Despite  these  regulations,  bitcoin  continues  to  boom  in  South  Korea.  South  Korea’s
cryptocurrency market is now the third largest in the world, trailing only the United States and
Japan. Blockchain technology companies have also sprung up across the country, and bitcoin
continues to skyrocket towards mainstream acceptance across the peninsular nation.
COINBASE:

and merchant services. It’s pretty much a one-stop shop for all cryptocurrency market players.
