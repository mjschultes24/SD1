Introduction:
Gainer Coin is based in London. With an aim to provide its users / investors the huge ROI of 800%
per annum even with 500 Masternodes.
The users have to purchase 5000 coins and make a Masternode to support the network.
Users then get 75% of the rewards of each block, for the PoS coin. If users cannot buy as much as
5000 coins, then they can buy any number of coins and do staking. Staking gives 25% of the rewards
of each block. You can expect regular maintenance and smooth flow of transactions / Blockchain as
we have already tested the blockchain for 2 weeks.
Rewards:
GAINER coin has dynamic reward structure. The rewards changes / increases as the block number
increases. The rewards are split into 75% for Masternode and 25% for Staking.
There is a Single wallet setup option for both staking and Masternode. This means that users do not
need to worry about the staking of rewards, as the wallet does both Masternode services and gives
rewards for coin staking too. The wallet can be used for multiple Masternodes and all the rewards
can be auto staked automatically.

WHITEPAPER
Advantages of investing in Masternode coin:
Early investors get coins at 1 USD  per coin. Early investors can right away start making Masternods
with the 5000 coins they receive. They can do staking if they have amount greater than 5000 or less
than 5000. We are not distributing tokens in ICO, but directly coins in ICO.
This is why users can directly start earning before the coin even hits the exchanges. We are planning
on getting the coin on http://Cryptopia.co.nz ,  http://gate.io http://kukcoin.com and
http://coinexchange.io , to ensure proper liquidity.
Future plans:
Integrating the coin on online casino sites as currency for gambling.
Adding the coin on the white label debit card websites which provide GNR to USD conversion and
withdrawal from Debit cards. Have sent proposals to
https://uquid.com/uquid-card
https://bitwala.com
Have sent proposal to:
http://cykeys.com for integrating GNR as currency for purchases of Games.
Rewards distribution:
There are 1200 Blocks a day. Example: The reward of 10 coins per block is divided into 75% for
Masternodes(7.5) and 20% for Staking (2.5)
Further the rewards are distributed to all running Masternodes. The more number of Maternodes,
the less rewards you get, because the rewards are distributed to each Masternode in a timely
manner. Coin Distribution of 1,000,000 (4%) pre-mine
Due to the fact that the Masternode rewards program is a fixed percentage and the Masternode network nodes
are fluctuating, expected Masternode rewards will vary according to the current total count of active
Masternodes. Payments for a standard day for running a Masternode can be calculated by using the following
formula:
Where:
n is the number of Masternodes an operator controls
t is the total number of Masternodes
r is the current block reward (presently averaging about 10 GAINER)
b is blocks in an average day. For the Dash network this usually is 1200.
a is the average Masternode payment (75% of the average block amount)
Return on investment for running a Masternode can be calculated as

WHITEPAPER
r * b *a / (n / t)
Where variables are the same as above.
The cost associated with running a Masternode creates a hard and soft limit of active nodes on the network. The
soft limit is imposed by the price it costs to acquire a node and the limited liquidity on exchanges due to usage of
Dash as a currency and not merely an investment.
Deterministic Ordering
A special deterministic algorithm is used to create a pseudo-random ordering of the Masternodes. By using the
hash from the proof-of-work for each block, security of this functionality will be provided by the mining network.
Pseudo Code, for selecting a Masternode:
For(mastenode  in  masternodes){
current_score  =  masternode.CalculateScore();
if(current_score  >  best_score){
best_score  =  current_score;
winning_node  =  masternode;
}
}
CMasterNode::CalculateScore(){
pow_hash  =  GetProofOfWorkHash(nBlockHeight);  //  get  the  hash  of  this  block
pow_hash_hash  =  Hash(pow_hash);  //hash  the  POW  hash  to  increase  the  entropy
difference  =  abs(pow_hash_hash  -  masternode_vin);
return  difference;
}
The example code can be extended further to provide rankings of Masternodes also, a “second”, “third”, “fourth”
Masternode in the list to be selected.
