Mission
« Bring professional trading tools to everyone by providing a simple yet
powerful drag’n’drop strategy builder »
Executive summary
Since 2009, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies enjoyed a phenomenal growth in terms of public
interest and valuation. Holding investors, professional traders and hobbyists all benefited in their
own ways from the amazing opportunities granted by this brave new world. Nevertheless the
trading game requires time, technical knowledge, analytical skills, discipline and proficiency using
professional tools in order to achieve true success. Crypto traders without all of this missed
opportunities or lost a chunk of their assets in the last few years.
Now that the Kryll.io platform enters the game, this is changing.
Kryll.io is the ultimate platform for cryptocurrency traders who are looking to use the most
advanced trading tools and strategies, as well as the combined intelligence of the community in
order to achieve the best returns in cryptocurrency markets.
The platform provides intuitive ways to create your own trading strategies and set them to
execute automatically. Through a What You See Is What You Trade interface you can design
trading strategies making use of the industry’s most powerful tools and safely test them with
backtesting and sandboxing.
Once your tools prove their worth you can set them to live-trade on your behalf, taking the right
positions at the right time, as if you’re following the markets 24/7.
On Kryll.io you can also rent-out your very own winning strategies that’ll help fellow traders
reach the success you did. You will be rewarded with passive income for doing so.
The core Kryll team is composed of veteran developers and Internet professionals who’ve all
been trading cryptocurrencies as hobbyists for years. With their background and close circle
of advisors ranging from economists, business developers, artificial intelligence and semantics
analysis experts, they’ve decided to build the right platform for crypto traders. They provide
fellow traders with the tools, community and environment they know everyone is longing for.

Introduction
Cryptocurrency trading has been a continuously rising market since the first bitcoin transaction
around early 2009. The next step spawned the birth of new cryptocurrencies and exchanges
where people could trade different currencies. Today there is an active community of millions of
traders exchanging coins in volumes corresponding to >100 Billion USD every single day.
There are dozens of exchanges where people buy or sell bitcoins or so called altcoins, trying to
make a profit from the current market trend, trading channels signals, news feeds or even pure
luck and intuition.
There are communities of hobbyist traders talking in channels like Telegram, Slack or Discord or
on internet forums, who collaborate in the hopes of forging a path through the vast universe or
crypto trades.
We’ve been part of this community for quite a while, and want to offer a tool allowing us to join
forces and all profit from. Historically, the hive mind has always won out.
Crypto trading facts
Hedge funds, professional traders and hobbyists share the same exchange platforms, and
environment but are not quite equal when it comes to resources, manpower, knowledge and
tools.
Indeed, efficient trading requires resources like computational power to run intensive data
models and crunch historical data trends crucial for assessing strategies risk-free. High-speed
connections are needed to reach to exchanges around the world.
Aside from computational resources, trading takes a lot of time, especially for a one-person




team. Preparing the right strategy, having it analyze relevant data and get it ready to execute in a
timely manner 24/7 within moving markets requires special abilities. This is hard enough leaving
aside the discipline of steel and cool head needed to take the right decision at the right time.
Trading is also a very technical domain where your area of expertise needs to span from an
ability to perform technical analyses to machine learning and semantics analyses.
Solution : Kryll Platform
The Kryll.io platform aims to fill in the gaps to get everyone efficient
trading tools.
Introducing WYSIWYT (What You See Is What You Trade) technology,
the Kryll team will provide a simple yet powerful strategy defining
interface based on blocks and flow. A flow visually describes the
confluence of signals, operators and relevant data determining a
particular strategy.
There are 5 main families of blocks that can be used to build a strategy :
Market Trends. They span from the usual trend analysis (volume modification,
price fluctuation, ) to technical data analysis & studies (channels identification,
patterns  detection,  resistance  rejection,  demand  zone  detection)  and
modelling (machine learning based market prediction) units.
Trading actions. Like buy, sell, split amount into subsets, hold amount (like
profits), loop, stop...
Signals. Coming from professional traders, qualified Telegram channels or
social network semantic analyses.
Operators. They’re meant to organize data feeds and signal interactions (eg:
IF the market is up AND “BTC” is receiving positive feedback on Twitter ...)
Notifications. To keep you informed of a strategy’s status (this could be a
Figure of block categories
text message, email or smart notification)
Once a strategy has been finalized it’s time to put it to work. Before sending it to the big boy
arena you’ll be able to test it over the 6 months of recorded data - assuming it does not depend
on an external non-reproducible input - using 250+ pairs and a 1 second frequency that will be
available for backtesting.
Another testing modality will be available with our sandboxing option where the strategy is
tested as if it were actually running on the market, but not accounting for the impact it may have
on the market’s actual.

When you are confident enough with a strategy’s efficiency you can put it to work in live-trading
and inject a small amount of Kryll (KRL) to grease the wheels.
Depending on your design and preference, a strategy may run once on your input, for example by
buying a coin at market price and optimizing its holding via a 2 steps Take-Profit and Stop-Loss
operation. Another might as well just listen to twitter sentiment about your favorite currency
to compare it with market data before notifying you of a (probable) dip. Yet another one (many
can run concurrently) may automatically stay awake, listening to market ready to buy a coin the
second it dips, whenever it may happen so to sell it for a profit and start all over, or send you an
alert when the mood is bad on social networs and marker starts dropping.

Kryll Companion app
Once  you  connect  your  mobile  companion  app  to  the
platform, you will be able to access your dashboard, get
push  notifications  regarding  your  strategy  runs  as  well
as stay connected in a much lower-key manner with your
crypto trading status.
It’ll be a pretty good feeling to get notified about a position
that’s been taken automagically and then sold, instead of an
alarming signal pushing you to quickly catch the opportunity
on your favorite exchange website.
Moreover  the  mobile  application  will  introduce  further
interactions with the strategies you designed or selected,
thus giving you complete control over your trades right in
the palm of your hand
Exchange Support
The Kryll.io platform will be interconnected via API to all exchanges that provide one, enabling
you to trade your favorite coin of your choice on your favorite exchange right from the platform.
This massive support will also allow you to use a single platform to manage your entire portfolio’s
strategy.
The    first    set    of    supported    exchanges    includes    the    following    platforms:
Bittrex, Poloniex, Kucoin , Coinbase/Gdax, Cryptopia, YoBit.net, Binance, HitBTC, Bitstamp, Liqui.




Architecture, Hosting,
Performance & Security
Figure of a full flow & block toolbox
Crypto currencies are traded  24/7. Kryll.io supports exchanges all around the world and is
committed to making its platform available, efficient and secure. The architecture of Kryll.
io encompasses several dedicated servers in Europe, Asia and North America, enabling the
execution of strategies in the most efficient way according to the exchange on which they are
taking place.
The infrastructure is designed so that it will scale automatically, providing maximal performance
and up-time for all connected users and strategies being run - whatever the circumstance.
Our user data is of the highest value and is why we take security very seriously. In addition to our
servers being under permanent DDOS protection, we also plan to have an external security audit
every quarter, thereby insuring things are safe and stay that way.
The platform will apply the strategies you have designed via the APIs provided by the supported
exchanges. Whenever the exchanges allow it, we will make sure that the API key does not allow
any withdrawal of funds, thus ensuring your currencies remain safely in your possession.




Kryll community commitment
Kryll.io isn’t just a great platform where you can easily build, test and automatically run your
strategies. We think collective intelligence is a huge asset that’ll make all of us more successful
in the trading market.
Therefore the platform will offer a marketplace section where anyone can share a strategy
build-up (as a blackbox) for others to enjoy in exchange of a KRL fee chosen by the creator and
free of charge from the platform. People with excellent insights, with more time available or a
well-honed intuition can help their fellow traders climb the success ladder.
The marketplace will also feature a chat section related to every strategy for people to interact
in, advise, receive advice from the startegy’s creator or other skilled users.
Strategies featured on the marketplace will be awarded a rating according to their users’ ratings
and internal measures of efficiency performed by the platform.
Because we’ve always placed users at the center of great products, you will be part of Kryll.io’s
life and evolution :
Р   Competitions will be organized where people will have to achieve the best performing
strategy given time and block limits for a given set of (past) data. Winners will be rewarded
with krylls for their talent.
Р   When we will have released our Block Construction Kit, hackathons will be organized
for developers to congregate and build up future winning blocks we’ll integrate   in the
platform(after thorough testing and benchmarking)
Р   Our past gaming experience taught us to make it easy and transparent to share results,
achievement on social media
Р   Once the first set of 50 blocks we have in mind will have been released, we have a lot more
ideas in the pipeline, and we’d love our community to vote for the next ones to come




Smart Token economy
Strategy cost
The Kryll.io platform economy relies on its utility tokens
(KRL) that can be spent when using a strategy in live
trading. Just like each smart-contract execution costs on
the Ethereum blockchain depends on the complexity of
the code, each live trading strategies execution on the
Kryll.io will cost some energy (KRL fractions) depending
on  the  complexity  of  the  task  performed.  Strategy
creation, backtests and sandbox testing will be free for
all users.
Apart from fractions of KRL spent in the platform to
fuel live trading strategies, no further expense will be
charged by the platform: no subscription plan, no hidden
fees, no commissions on trade, no strategy rent fees…
Cost governance
Since the token value (as compared to USD) will vary over time, an autonomous decentralised
smart-contract will re-assess every 48 hours the energy needed to run the blocks in order to
keep it at a fair level for everyone, whatever the value of the token takes over time.
Community provided strategies
When using a strategy provided by a creator, energy will be sent to the platform to fuel it, as
well as an excess of Krylls set by the creator as a reward for the work, Kryll.io will never take a
fee on strategy sharing or renting.
Business plan
The token sale will fund the development of the platform as well as provide marketing power
to get onboard new users. After that step, users using it in live trading will pay a fee that’ll be
recouped over time to cover the exploitation, maintenance and extension of Kryll.io.
Our past entrepreneurial endeavors tell us that 3 years business plans are unreliable given the
reality of highly variable environments, which is all the more true in the cryptocurrency world.
Nevertheless, we’ve projected one anyways !
Using Bittrex as an example and based on a rough estimate, if there are 0.2% of monthly users
on the platform in 2019 spending the equivalent of 6 USD per month in KRL (10 KRL) on average,
the operating cost of the platform will be covered. Given this, we will be able to invest a third of
the revenue into R&D projects in addition to keeping on innovating on the platform.




Token Sale Details
Why a Token Sale ?
An Initial Token Sale or Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is the event for a cryptocurrency project such
as Kryll.io to sell its cryptocurrency tokens (KRL) to early adopters and enthusiasts in exchange
for funding.
This is an opportunity for Kryll.io to fund the future development of the platform and for the
purchasers of tokens to participate in the early stage of the project.
From the Kryll.io platform’s point of view, it is also an unique opportunity to inform future users
(whether they actually participate in the sale or not) about features they’ll be able to enjoy on
the platform. Moreover, users who’ll have taken part in the Initial Token Sale will benefit from an
early glimpse at the platform when the “funders” version is released.
