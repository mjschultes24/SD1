Republia Whitepaper
Abstract
Technologies, in fact, about people,
not about hardware or software.
Robert Veiday, Head of the
Department of Technological
Development Khemeia Consulting
ABSTRACT
Republia is a large-scale decentralized ecosystem, that includes elements of
the countries that are familiar to us in the digital space and operates
mechanisms based on blockchain technology.
The coordination structure of Republia is analogous to “we-government”
model that is aimed at direct management of the ecosystem, without involving
the relevant regulatory institutions.
“We-ecosystem” is a new stage of management that excludes mediation and
provides platform users with opportunity to influence the development of the
system and make decisions according to different changes.
The project collected all the most relevant mechanisms of the real countries
that are familiar to us and combined them with highly efficient technologies.
The global ecosystem Republia is a set of operating tools based on well-
organized structure, operating under a set of internal rules, that ensures safe and
comfortable usage at every stage of operation.
Ecosystem is based on the main principles of the operation of blockchain
technologies.
secure storage of user data (information and resources are protected
through integration with Republia blockchain);
justice (all disputes are resolved by consensus);
transparency (ecosystem users always have access to all the necessary
information);
full democracy (members of the ecosystem directly affect the life of
Republia).

Republia Whitepaper
Abstract
The key components of the decentralized ecosystem provide a trusted and
absolutely transparent relationship between users, presenting a unique concept
of smart contracts, a platform for creating and modifying the entire ecosystem as
well as comfortable way of communication between community members.
A distinctive feature for Republia project is an approach to safety: innovative
protocol is embedded in the project ensuring data and resource protection in the
conditions of the entire global ecosystem.
Republia’s internal payment tool is an RPB coin protected from strong
volatility, smoothing of volatility shows undoubted advantage of RPB along with
other coins of the crypto industry.
Republia can be seen as a platform for organizing campaigns to attract
investments through ICO, while protecting all blockchain communities from
fraudulent schemes.
The white paper of Republia project includes the study of all components of
the decentralized global ecosystem, the description of the possibilities of
fundamentally new technology and a proof of the need for such solutions in
industry.

Nowadays new ICO are being created on the blockchain Ethereum Platform,
NEM, NXT, Waves etc. The first of them, in turn, is able to conduct  maximum of
25 transactions per second which is the minimum indicator of the comfortable
usage of the network.
Limited capacity of the network is an important drawback of the existing
crypto-currencies and it is associated with the original nature of the blockchain.
New projects often do not represent specific technologies, which creates mass
character, but not market stability.
Against the backdrop of the emergence of a huge number of ICOs which are
connected neither ideologically no technologically, there is a glut of the industry.

Starting from 2008 network of Bitcoin cryptocurrency has been undergoing a
lot of hard forks. Users turn to this step in order to solve the problem of
scalability, low capacity of transactions, limited block size and generally offload
common Bitcoin network.
At the same time hard fork entails creation of a new network chain which no
longer operates according to the rules that were established by an old protocol of
the blockchain. The nodes of a new and an old network are incompatible since
hard fork means changes in the mechanism of consensus itself.
According to the experts such an oversaturation of the industry with so many
variations of one crypto-currency undermines trust of users towards blockchain,
because, in fact, hard fork is a side effect of disagreements within the crypto
community.
Many crypto enthusiasts are sure that instead of permanent separation from
2
the main networks, it is better to come to a common agreement.

Various factors affect crypto-market: economic and political situation,
emergence of new-cryptocurrencies, news, demand or supply from users or
investors.
The volatility of crypto-currency can be 50-100% just because of one piece of
news and several large traders that came into the market.
If you compare digital assets with fiat money, average annual volatility of fiat
money usually does not exceed 3-4%. In cryptocurrency this figure often is more
than 20%.

Members of the blockchain community are constantly at risk by providing
their data and funds to various projects. Only in 2017 several serious hacking
were recorded, which resulted in losses of billions of dollars.

It is known that crypto community can be conditionally divided into two
groups. The first group perceives crypto-currencies as a payment tool, and the
second group considers them as an investment tool. Often these two groups
argue with each other and it leads to uncompromising division of the crypto-
currency into two new digital assets with own rules and regulations.

Republia Whitepaper
Background
The problem is that fragmentation will not stop, as a result, the market will
be filled with new coins and tokens.
Since Republia acts on “we-ecosystem” ideology, where users can directly
participate in the process of modernization of technological solutions, the project
is based on the advanced system of consensus, which is one of the main
advantages of technology. Modernization means addition of new functions to the
subsystem.

Republia Whitepaper
Background
Due to voting system, that leads to adoption the decisions by consensus,
and then automated updating of the protocol among users, Republia completely
solves the problem of hardforks.
Republia creates a single public blockchain, and its protocol is automatically
updated. Since the system of the blockchain protocol is divided into three layers
(network layer, layer of consensus, transaction layer), separating one layer from
the others means that protocol can be modified without need for hardfork, the
general system is doomed to split because of hardfork. Read more in Technical
Paper.
2.2                                                                                 Protection of fraudulent projects
Republia can be considered as a platform for ICO, while it protects the entire
blockchain community from the emergence of  projects that are ultimately
announced as SCAM. This goal has been achieved by expanding the entire
Republia ecosystem with  interrelated projects, rather than adding competitive
ICOs, as it occurs inside, for example, the Ethereum Platform. However,
competition remains in another form. Users compete for modernization, but not
for maximizing profits.
To add the desired project to Republia ecosystem you will need to submit an
application within Republia ICO Platform and go through voting phase among
users, which is based on the layer of  Republia Blockchain consensus protocol.
Users can apply amendments to any subsystem as well, when most users
consider a particular function as an error in the ecosystem, they can vote for
changing or deleting this function.
Each decision on a particular vote is entered in the blockchain and has its
own hash and hash of the decision that was adopted or rejected. Also
participants who voted will be recorded in the block, their decisions and time of
the vote will be shown to the entire community, this type of the block can be
viewed at any time, in this case falsifications are impossible.
Thus Republia is a complex system, in which each subsequent addition is a
product, and there is a demand among real users for this product.

Security is a priority for Republia team, all important information is stored in
Cloud X.    It is a decentralized data storage, that provides security of information
and funds in the context of the entire global ecosystem.
Republia offers its users a unique digital analog Identity Card - RepubliaID.
The main feature of RepubliaID is advanced security, which minimizes the risks of
losing funds or hacking user accounts. Moreover, RepubliaID is used to identify
users in the voting, exchange and Republia banking system. In this way,
participant that owns RepubliaID becomes a full member of Republia community
and can directly influence the life of the community.
VERACITY
SYSTEM
Republia offers three-level security - Veracity System:
The first level is a password and biometric identification of users;
The second level is a confirmation by email + two-factor authentication;
The third level is RepubliaID.
In case of hacking attempt Veracity System automatically freezes all user
data, including his private information and information on his accounts.
Moreover, Veracity System will help to ensure that user can access his data
and funds within the shortest period of time.
Veracity System is an innovative security system, which is the first product in
the line of Republia development using artificial intelligence.

PROJECT SPECIFIC SECTION
The developers of the project laid a powerful technological foundation, due
to this foundation all elements of the ecosystem will be realized with higher
efficiency, than existing technological solutions, thus, the basic principles of the
operation of blockchain technology will be observed - decentralized management,
justice and pure democracy.
The goal of Republia project is to create large-scale decentralized
ecosystem, which combines elements of countries that are familiar to us and
mechanisms based on blockchain technology, where users make decisions
through consensus and influence modernization of the entire ecosystem directly.
Republia tasks:
to enable users to manage components of the ecosystem through
transparent and democratic management system (we-ecosystem);
to prevent the emergence of SCAM-projects;
to establish trustworthy and transparent relationship between users by
means of advanced system of smart contracts;
to exclude the possibility of loss or theft of user accounts through three-level

The large-scale ecosystem of Republia allows its users to make important
decisions in the life of Republia and to influence the modernization and
expansion of ecosystem elements. Such possibility appears due to Republia
operation within the framework of “we-ecosystem” model, which, in turn, is aimed
at direct management of the platform, avoiding relevant regulatory authorities.
3.1.1                                                                              Distinction of “we-ecosystem”
In the traditional model of governance of a democratic state there are
numerous branches of legislative and executive authorities between the head of
state (president) and nation.
Example of the US government
Separation of power in the United States of America
Legislative branch                                                                                                                 Executive branch
The bicameral congress                                                             President                                       Judicial power
Senate Supreme Chamber                                                             Lower Chamber of Representatives                Supreme Court
If we exclude mediation in the digital world and provide users with opportunity
to influence the development of the system by themselves, making decisions
according to the changes in the community independently, new stage of
management will appear - “we-ecosystem”.

Operations of Veracity System when recording
suspicious activity of an account:
1. Instant notification of user( when system detects an attempt to
hack into an account, user is instantly notified about it via a
phone call, message, e-mail notification etc.);
2. Automatic freezing of all data( during hacking attempt all data
regarding funds and private information are frozen automatically,
in order to exclude access by third parties);
3. Help in regaining control over your account (when hacking
attempt is detected, Veracity System freezes the data for 72
hours, during this time the security system due to a specific
algorithm will help the user to be able to access his account at
the shortest period of time);
4. As additional security, the user is given an opportunity to
specify in settings three ecosystem participants - recovery
partners, who are assigned digital keys. To restore access to your
account, digital keys must unite.
All user information is stored in Cloud X, which provides transparent
relationship between community members and minimizes the risks of losses
both informational and financial.

Taking into account all the drawbacks of existing market solutions, Republia
presents its own ICO Platform.
All elements of Republia ecosystem will be interrelated, as they will logically
complement each other.
For example, consensus will not allow to pass ICO, if such a project already
exists in the system, since there is no need to create projects on the platform
several times, taking into account narrow market.
User account will show the requests of teams, wishing to conduct their ICO
on the platform and supplement Republia ecosystem with their projects.

To expand the ecosystem with your project you need:
to be a member of Republia ecosystem;
to have a unique RepubliaID;
to fill in an application form;
to pass automated verification Republia Spam-Content Bot;
to pass an independent expert evaluation, which is carried out by
professionals, chosen by the community members;
to pass successfully a voting stage, in which at least 50% of ecosystem
members should take part, while 51% of them will support the hosted project.
Republia ICO Platform will allow to expand, add and supplement one or
another product of the system.
One of the advantages of such a system is data analysis in conditions of
Republia ICO Platform, which occurs according to this principle:

Republia ICO Platform is a place, where you can bring your idea to realisation
without owning a huge capital and get a response from blockchain community.
In addition to the above Republia ICO Platform operates in order to inspire users
to new accomplishments in the industry, always pointing out inaccuracies during
consideration of the projects for the purpose of further improvements.

RPB coin is a main payment tool in Republia Bank, which is based on
decentralized and transparent mechanisms.
The smoothing volatility is a definite advantage of RPB along with other
coins of the crypto industry, the goal was achieved by implementation of Republia
Bank, which is the main component of the economic model of decentralized
Republia ecosystem.       Its main purpose is to smooth the volatility of RPB coin
and two types of tokens released by Republia.
Republia Bank combined principles of the Central Banks of countries familiar
to us and innovative technologies. Republia Bank automatically regulates the
volume of demand and supply on exchanges. Smoothed volatility is a result of a
balance and an automated analysis of the market situation. Republia participants
are an integral part of the stabilization of RPB coin, as the system offers them
rewards for holding coins depending on the balance of demand and supply, which
are formed from commission charges for the mining of RPB and reserve fund of
Republia Bank.
RPB cryptocurrency does not depend on top 10 cryptocurrency, this step
provides support for the coin rate of exchange while the price of popular
cryptocurrency is declining.
Stability makes RPB coin suitable for both trading, long-term investments
and for daily financial transactions.
RPB is a cryptocurrency, which is a convenient payment tool for daily usage.
Republia represents two generations of the bank - Republia Bank Classic and
Republia Bank Next.

Republia Bank involves in its work two cold and one hot wallet.
The first cold wallet performs the role of a reserve fund, which is constantly
supplemented by a commission, accrued by mining. This type of wallet is formed
in Genesis Block.
The purpose of the second cold wallet is to accept funds when user converts
RPB coin to USDR token.
The third type of wallet, hot wallet, is used to pay interest rates in the bank.

In Republia Bank 4 types of “parkings” are available (day, week, month and 6
months). The user receives a reward for holding funds at his wallet accrued
according to “parked” amount.
Interest is accrued from the reserve fund Republia Bank, which consists of
160 million coins. A fee is also charged for each of the guessed block, which is
recorded in Genesis Block Republia Blockchain.
In the addition to above, each user is provided with information on funds,
stored in the bank, function of viewing the bank’s expenses and incomes as well
as overall financial status of Republia Bank, which is a proof of its openness to
ecosystem participants. Republia Bank, as a legal entity, is an institution, which is

Republia Bank Classic will be functioning for the first two years of the
ecosystem and then it will be transformed into Republia Bank Next, transferring
part of functionality from the previous version.
The main objectives of Republia Bank Classic are to reduce volatility in the first
stages of operation and popularize the ecosystem in the industry.
The tool for smoothing volatility, “Parking”, will also tolerate the transition to
another stage, thereby dividing Republia Bank into two generations.
This step provides users with an honest and voluntary system of holding funds
with transparent payments.

From the economic point of view, such technology as   “Parking”, will not be
able for many years to satisfy the level of user demand that is observed on the
market.
Thus, interest rates during the first two years will be at the maximum levels -
70% per annum, then they will gradually and evenly decline.
3.4.5                                                                                Republia Bank Next
Taking into account high demand for payments after two years of operation
of the system, Republia Bank Nex will be brought into operation. This project is a
financial institution that will act as an investment bank in the real economic
sector.
Republia Bank Next will undertake a task of accepting payments and will act
within the framework of European legislation in accordance with regulations of
international banking standards.
Users of the ecosystem are offered two types of banking:
1. Decentralized (when using a decentralized version, interest after two-year
period will be lower than in the regulated Republia Bank Next).
2. Regulated in the real sector ( percentage deductions from “parking” of the
second type will remain almost at the same high level, as in Republia Bank
Classic ).
In the addition to above, Republia Bank Next will provide quarterly reports,
which will describe all investment activities.

In order to achieve smoothed volatility of RPB coin USDR tokens and
Republia Bonds operate in Republia ecosystem.
These tools are introduced taking into account behavioural theory, according
to this theory some shareholders want to move to more reliable and secure asset
during disbalance of demand and supply. This disbalance is characterized by
moving the investors to more stable assets(for example, the Swiss franc or gold)
and is observed in global crises, during the fall of stock markets. “USDR’ system
operates by the same principle. It is designed to encourage users to “lock in”
during strong market fluctuations. USDR token is provided by the reserve fund
Republia Bank in the conditions of real banking institutions.
USDR tokens, in turn, are backed by the corresponding amount of US dollars.
In order to achieve minimum market price fluctuation in USDR, Republia
introduces an advanced algorithm, based on artificial intelligence and
participation of financial experts. This algorithm is based on usage of the system
of bonds (Republia Bonds).
Bond tokens are released by  Republia Group and are sold on the basis of
auctions.    The number of bonds and, correspondingly, the number of USDR
tokens (1USDR:1USD) are known in advance, as Republia Group assumes an
obligation to provide financial statements on financial condition of the banking
institution on a quarterly basis.
After making a decision to release a certain number of USDR tokens on the
market, automatic exchange of bond tokens to USDR starts by “First in - First out”
principle, which means that the first participants of auction will be given top
priority in receiving USDR.
If the price does not correspond to the declared characteristics of the token
(1token:1USD) or if the balance of demand and supply is undetermined, Republia
Group activates additional number of bonds, which had been released, but were
not distributed among the participants of auction. In the addition to above, the
user is provided with an opportunity to exchange his USDR tokens to the US
dollars at any time via Republia Exchange and receive the amount to his bank
account, in this case his tokens will be burned.

Republia Bank releases its own debit card, and USDR token will be a payment
tool of this card, which is very convenient way of exchanging cryptocurrency to
fiat funds when paying bills by debit card, since USDR is bound to a stable fiat
currency - USD.
Fast transactions are provided by internal conversion of  RPB coin to USDR
token, which is equivalent to the US dollar 1:1. Due to Republia Blockchain
transactions will be executed much faster, than via such popular systems as
Mastercard, American Express or Visa.
Republia Bank system is configured in such a way that  that users always
have an opportunity to “lock in” in dollar and to have more innovative tool of
management - “parking”, while receiving a stable income.

Republia plans to achieve the same transaction speed in decentralized Rialto
Exchange , as it happens inside decentralized analogues.
Republia Exchange is a platform for making fast and secure transaction,
which is ensured by Veracity System.
Emporium provides an opportunity for the exchange and executions of
transactions via internal Republia bank cards. When making a transaction by
Republia debit card, certain amount of RPB coins will be sold under a market
order and the transaction will be made faster, than via such popular payment
systems as MasterCard or Visa, due to instantaneous operation of Atomic Swap.

Eric Berne, American psychologist
CONSENSUS
One of the main advantages of the technology, underlying the project, is the
ability of users to participate directly in the process of modernization of
technological and ideological solutions of the entire ecosystem, it is called
consensus.
Modernization means addition of new functions to the subsystem.
1. Consensus in Republia ICO Platform.
Republia users decide whether the proposed ICO is needed or not in the
ecosystem.
2. Consensus for changing any subsystem.
When most users consider a function as a critical error in the ecosystem,
they can vote for changing or deleting this function.
Falsifications are impossible
Elimination of falsifications in voting:
decision is recorded in blockchain;
regardless of the result, the decision has own hash;
openness throughout the community (decisions of all participants, time of
their votes are available for viewing)

Using the number of your RepubliaID ensures fair and open voting,
confirming that it is not falsified, as it is impossible to forge, because it is a
unique, digital passport, and information about this passport is stored in Republia
distributed register.
Republia does not allow any falsifications in its ecosystem: user can see ID
of each voter, as they all use this security tool.

Republia Cloud X
When a good idea has struck you, act
immediately.
Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft
REPUBLIA CLOUD X
Decentralized data storage is the future.
All data exchanged between users in Republia ecosystem is stored under
reliable protection of Cloud X technology.
Cloud X was developed by Republia, and it is a decentralized cloud storage.
Large flows of information flow through Republia ecosystem. Taking care of
data security, they are not stored on Republiа servers, instead all user information
is stored decentrally in an encrypted form.
Economy of Republia project is built in such a way, that users are paid for the
storage of data. Cloud X technology eliminates the problem of information theft.
Popular services such as Facebook or Google, for the purpose of targeting,
collect personal information and data about site visits. Considering this, Repulia
provides complete security inside the ecosystem, because user data is stored
decentrally in an encrypted form. Payment for data storage is not provided.
Republia Cloud X is a safe data storage, and it is the future of the entire
global ecosystem. All information is controlled by users without centralized
servers.
51




Republia Whitepaper
Republia Cloud X
Republia Cloud X in the ecosystem is responsible for storing:
1. Data about chats between users;
2. Attached files;
3. Media files;
4. Information, recorded in RepubliaID;
5. Confidential information, generated on the platform ( user data is recorded
in Republia blockchain, due to this process the identity of ecosystem participant
is verified)
Republia Cloud X is also responsible for decentralized training of artificial
intelligence (Machine Learning). So all data of the machine that you are training is
stored in Cloud X. Decentralized training will take longer time than in case of
Google AI, but with higher quality and safer.
The inspiration of this technology is the development of the open source
system of machine learning IBM (IBM Analytics).
In the code it will be written:
class learning =
object
initializer
_className <- "learning"
val _env =
Env.getEnv()
val mutable _learningObject : learningObject =
new dummyLearningObject
method getLearningObject : learningObject =
_learningObject
method setLearningObject (obj : learningObject) =
_learningObject <- obj

Republia Rating system
I am convinced, that science and
research bring more pleasure than
making money
Stephen Hawking, theoretical
physicist
REPUBLIA RATING SYSTEM
Republia Rating system is designed to exclude malevolent users from the
ecosystem, whose purpose is to harm, discriminate the system or to create
obstacles for other users in making decisions and in Republia life.
Republia Rating system provides users with confidence in professional
competence of each Republia participant.
Republia Rating system is embedded in such subsystems as:
Republia Bank;
Republia Exchange (in Emporium and Rialto);
Smart Contract Platform;
Votings (Consensus);
Republia Cloud X;
Spam-Content Bot.
Participants with high rating will receive additional bonuses of the
ecosystem ( visiting free meetups, organized by Republia Foundation, reducing
commission etc.)
The user rating will decrease for misbehaviour inside ecosystem (spam
attacks, deception of other participants, theft of funds and attempts to hack
accounts).
54




Republia Whitepaper
Republia Rating system
Reducing a rating could also be a consequence of verification which was not
passed by spam content. In this case user is not allowed to access functions of
“parking” in Republia Bank, to trade on Republia Exchange, to take part in voting
on ICO Platform.
Errors in calculation of the rating and falsified results are impossible in
Republia Rating System, because this system is completely autonomous.
If the user does not agree with his rating, there is a special automatic revision of
coefficients in response to a user request.
Such steps are aimed at users mutual respect and Republia intention to
become one of the most progressive ecosystems in blockchain community.

Republia Wallet
Innovation distinguishes the leader
from the person, who is trying to catch
up.
Steve Jobs, founder of Apple
REPUBLIA WALLET
Republia Wallet is a unique, complex technology, that includes both a wallet
and an instant messenger with the addition of contacts via RepubliaID.
Republia Wallet solves the problem of heavy wallets with 16-digit addresses
through the implementation of the possibility of transaction using the number of
RepubliaID.
In Republia Wallet users can view their transaction history of their
transactions, using clear and user-friendly graphical interface they can send or
accept payment, and all transactions are under the protection of Veracity System.
Holders of Republia Wallet can use a convenient function of expanding their
address book by contacts via RepubliaID and users can open or close an access
to sending funds.
Republia Wallet includes not only the technology of wallet, but also instant
messenger, users can exchange messages, files (stored in Republia Cloud X), and
create smart contracts with their contacts.
The possibility of direct voting is introduced in Republia Wallet as well, the
user can directly participate in any voting created in the ecosystem, the result of
voting will influence the modernization of Republia technologies.
Republia ecosystem offers several types of wallets:
1. Heavy wallet (full node):
with GUI secure locker ;
with GUI full version of the ecosystem.
57




Republia Whitepaper
Republia Wallet
In a heavy wallet there are a full node and a full Republia client, in which all
the functions of the ecosystem are available, including Republia Bank, Republia
Exchange, ICO Platform etc. After downloading a full node, the user also
becomes a participant in blocks confirmation, in other words in PoA mining. The
ecosystem provides a version in which only a full node will be available with the
ability to store funds, in this case GUI will look like a secure locker and storage.
2. Light weight wallet:
In this type of wallet a full blockchain is not embedded, but it is implemented
into site to transfer components of the wallet.

TECHNOLOGIES OF AI (½)
Republia implements artificial intelligence as machine learning for one
personal user. The user will train his one machine and all data will be stored in
Cloud X system and under reliable protection of Veracity System. In the future
these results will be used in IoT component. Republia offers a solution which will
allow to use confidential information decentrally without collecting it. Thus,
Republia develops decentralized AI.
Personal machine learning is a basis for real AI which will operate in
decentralized manner. All data collected by AI1 are not recorded in public register,
but are stored in Cloud X. Analysis of this data will be personalized which
excludes the usage of confidential information by third parties.
In the ecosystem Artificial intelligence will be used: 1) in Republia Bank
(regulation of interest rates); 2) spam content; 3) in the rating system; 4) for
personal machine learning
Artificial intelligence in RepubliaID decentrally read out information about the
type of device when logging in, analyzing recent entries.
While implementing decentralized mechanisms of data analysis, Republia
completely protects its users from transferring/ hacking/ selling accounts.

Republia Initial Coin Offering
REPUBLIA INITIAL COIN OFFERING
The date of Pre-SALE is  from 23.08.18 to 23.09.18.
The date of PUBLIC SALE is from 23.11.18 to 23.12.18.
Republia conduct a campaign for attracting investment in two stages in
order to provide maximum transparency and efficiency of using the collected
funds.
Thus, during Pre-SALE, Republia attracts financing for finalization and official
release of the test version of Republia Blockchain (testnet). Before the beginning
of PUBLIC SALE phase all users will be provided with opportunity to participate in
testing of this protocol. Hard cap of Pre-SALE stage implies the release of
maximum full-fledged product, which together with existing results of Republia
Group (MVP) will show all the advantages of the project. In addition, before Pre-
SALE, Private Round is started, which has a number of distinctions from existing
forms of attracting funds. During the month before Pre-SALE stage, Republia
Group will provide everybody with an opportunity to leave objective feedback
about the project, point out possible errors and assist in the implementation of
their corrections. Private Round does not mean attracting funds, but only real
participation of users and potential community for the improvement of any
component of the project. This step will provide Republia project with an
opportunity to move to the stage of collecting funds taking into account
suggestions of all users, which entails the creation of real democratic project, in
which decisions and possible adjustments are made by users.
Collecting funds take place on the principle of share participation, which
means obtaining a share by each investor, which is calculated in relation to the
total amount invested by all PUBLIC SALE participants. In addition to the above,
Private Round participants receive additional 5% from invested funds as a bonus,
which is an incentive to participate in the modernization of the project.
PUBLIC SALE phase is conducted to attract investment for the
implementation of the entire ecosystem. Taking into account the real demand of
investors for the fastest project implementation, Republia Group will do its best
to implement the entire project and the components of the ecosystem during 1-2
years, which, first of all, directly depends on the amount of collected funds.
