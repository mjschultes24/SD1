BEATZCOIN.IO WHITEPAPER
INTRODUCTION
WHAT ARE VIBRAVID AND BEATZCOIN?
VibraVid is here to change the way consumers interact with digital content, while
increasing the revenue potential of content creators. VibraVid is a free P2P/peer-topeer desktop and mobile streaming application that enables users to view and listen to
content created by video and audio creators.
VibraVid is a platform for creators to upload, store, market, lease and sell their content to
users with the added benefits of being able to crowdfund and sell merchandise and event
tickets directly to their subscribers and fans.
BeatzCoin is a cryptocurrency which is the exchange of value on the VibraVid platform.
Together, VibraVid and BeatzCoin provide an ecosystem that allows creators and users a
means of exchange, peer-to-peer, for goods, services, through bounties, and as prizes.
Both, users and creators, are rewarded for their participation by receiving BeatzCoin,
which they can use to purchase content, fan merchandise and event tickets, as well as to
promote their own content.
THE PROBLEM:
Over 600,000 hours of video content and 18,000 hours of music is uploaded to the major
free streaming services on the web daily for consumers to view and listen to 1. This
makes it incredibly difficult for an emerging creator to be noticed. Creating high quality
content requires time and resources, as does content marketing.
6
BEATZCOIN.IO WHITEPAPER
A paradoxical situation arises wherein the creator is forced to forsake production in favor
of marketing and advertising. Instead of using time and talent to produce creative
works, the creator becomes a marketer, resulting in a massive amount of low quality
content made available to users, who, in turn, lose interest.
Even with a successful team and marketing campaign, statistics show that the majority of
any targeted audience does not interact with a content creator’s advertisement or provide
feedback. The VibraVid platform aims to solve the issue of discover-ability with the added
benefits of an improved method for increasing user interaction, critiquing and feedback.
Existing platforms are focused primarily on increasing advertising revenues and provide
insufficient participation incentives for users and content creators alike. They offer
marketing solutions to creators at a premium and do not incentivize users to view or listen
to new content.
The most successful creators earn a minority share of revenue from the platforms they
upload their content to. VibraVid feels that this is an unfair business model and our platform
seeks to change the status quo in favor of content creators and users by incentivizing
them to create and enjoy quality content.We believe that this not only will allow more
creators to start making new and independent content, but will also allow them to
generate a fair income that is truly based on the popularity of their content.
7
BEATZCOIN.IO WHITEPAPER
1. Signing up to the VibraVid platform
2. Locking their tokens
3. Participating in bounties
4. Opting to watch paid to view (PTV) advertisements
5. Competing in daily and weekly challenges
Some of the ways creators on theVibraVid platform will
earn BeatzCoin are:
1. Having their content watched or listened to
2. Having the most views in a selected period
3. Allowing paid to view (PTV) advertisements on their content
4. Receiving tips from viewers
5. Crowdfunding on our platform
THE SOLUTION:
With BeatzCoin at the center of VibraVid, we are able to offer both users and creators a
new way of earning money for creating, watching, or listening to what they love.
While advertising is not a thing of the past, we believe that users should be able to
decide if they want to view adverts, and creators should be able to decide whether, and how
frequently, advertisements are displayed during the duration of their content.
Some of the ways VibraVid
users will earn BeatzCoin are:

THE OPPORTUNITY
In 2016, the music industry generated 15.7 billion dollars, globally. This was after a 15
year decline in revenue from 1999 to 2014 where it declined by 40%. This up-tick in
revenue is attributed to the accessibility of digital music. From 2004, where digital
music held a share of 0.4% of the total market revenue, it has now grown to exceed
50% of the market.
This is mainly due to technological advancements, better mobile data connectivity, and
streaming services, the latter of which turned the music industry around after many
years of piracy-related decline.
The industry is now growing steadily at approximately 5.9% per annum, with 60.4%
growth in streaming services and 17.7% digital revenue growth. Physical revenue is
down 7.6% and download revenue is down 20.5%.
Video streaming has had an equally meaningful impact on us, with over 100,000 hours
of video being streamed every minute on subscription based services, and more than
600,000 hours of video being uploaded to free video streaming services - all indicators
that the industry is experiencing exponential growth. The 2017 revenues created by the
top 10 streaming video providers stood at $781M. The most interesting statistic being
that Q1 2017 realized $145M in revenue, and Q4’s revenue was $242M.
VibraVid’s timely market entry is a strategy certain to genuinely benefit and justly reward a
large variety of creatives including, but not limited to, popular video creators, instrumental
producers, musicians and movie producers and their many fans and followers.

BEATZCOIN.IO WHITEPAPER
– USERS
Users will be able to decide whether they would like to view adverts on the platform, which
will earn them BeatzCoin, or they may opt to turn it off. The selection will not be fixed and
can be changed by the user at any time.
They will be able to stake their tokens and earn interest by using Proof of Locked Stake
(POLS). The tokens will be locked for predetermined periods which will lower the circulating
supply.
Users may choose to enter various bounties on the platform in order to earn
additional BeatzCoin. There will be two types of platform-based bounties; free and
paid. Paid bounties will require all participants to pool a small amount of BeatzCoin in order
to stand a chance of winning a larger amount of tokens.
The platform will also offer daily and weekly challenges which the user can participate in
to win tokens.
Users will be able to search for content by audio or video and play it on either their
mobile or desktops. Some content will have a cost which is allocated by the creator, and
some will be free or paid to the user to play or download.
HOW IT WORKS
Joining VibraVid will be a simple process. Anyone wanting to participate will
register a Tron wallet address.
10
BEATZCOIN.IO WHITEPAPER
– CREATORS
Once a creator has completed their registration, they will be able to upload their content
to our blockchain-based P2P network.
Creators will then be able to set the fee for playing/viewing the individual track,
album, video or season.
They will be able to decide whether they will make their content available for lease or
sale (download-able) or to rent for a specific period of time.
VibraVid will also provide creators with the means to create crowd-funded projects as
well as sell merchandise and tickets to events.
The marketing section on the creators dashboard will allow for the set up of bounties
for platform users to earn BeatzCoin, focused recommendations to users, spotlight
promotion, as well as rotation spots on our streaming platforms VibraVid TV and VibraVid
Radio.
Creators will also be able to participate in VibraVid sponsored creator competitions.

BEATZCOIN ROADMAP
BEATZCOIN.IO WHITEPAPER
1. Due to nodes on the network, space is plentiful
2. Fast Bandwidth Speeds
3. Larger files can be automatically split into chunks
4. There is an existing network structure with many dApps
We do however foresee a few issues:
1. Videos that are stored on the network would not be restricted to VibraVid, the
reward structure could be circumvented using a regular IPFS node and streaming
tools.
2. Data is stored in an open environment
TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY
The three primary aspects of BeatzCoin are the Video/Audio Streaming, Payment
Incentivization, and License and Distribution Control.
VibraVid aims to build a reward structure for accessing, watching and listening to
content while allowing for the licensing control of the content to be held directly by the
creator.
We will make use of the IPFS protocol, A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to
distribute the content on the platform.
IPFS allows for files to be shared and accessed by a large number of distributed devices
with the goal of creating a distributed internet. Files are hashed and accessible using the
IPFS:// structuring.
VibraVid chose to use IPFS for a number of reasons:
14
BEATZCOIN.IO WHITEPAPER
We plan on minimizing the risk of these issues by encoding the videos with an overlay
layer, so that either a BeatzCoin wallet or node is required to decode it (consensus
Recognition). We will also push hash addresses onto the blockchain in an alternate format
(encrypt it), and then decrypt it with an unreleased mathematical calculation.
Finally, we will also keep all videos protected by utilizing a key structure, which will
allow VibraVid sites to be the only provider of the content.
This will ultimately protect content providers and their content to ensure that they
are able to own and distribute their material whichever way they choose.
There is also the concern of illicit materials such as pirated content or pornography
making its way onto the network. The team will monitor content to ensure that these
materials do not get uploaded to the platform, however should they be uploaded, we will
blacklist the hash for any of these videos, making it unwatchable. We do, however, plan for
further decentralization by implementing consensus-based rewards for nodes that blacklist
the hash of unlawful content.

TOKEN TRADING EVENT OVERVIEW
KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER/ANTI-MONEY
LAUNDERING REGULATIONS
For our private sale, VibraVid will follow all mandatory legal requirements in line with the
KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulation and with
solutions in place to detect and prevent suspicious activityfor our private sale.
As part of the private sale, background and compliance checks are executed on all
token buyers. The KYC process is a fundamentally important part of VibraVid’s
promise to identify users who require further investigation, and for ultimately providing
evidence to enable VibraVid to approve/deny new users.
The KYC process includes validating the identity of users involving personal ID verification
checks. A successful KYC process must also comply with local regulations, and VibraVid will
do so without altering the customer experience.
VibraVid will include KYC processes and procedures across our future locations to
build a global set of KYC rules, as well as establish specific rules to comply with local
regulatory requirements.
TOKEN STRUCTURE
VibraVid will hold a preliminary Token Trading Event, and a Main Token Trading Event. The
preliminary will be announced in August, 2018 and will run until October 15, 2018. The Main
Event will be divided into three stages. Each stage will offer 400 million BeatzCoin and will
last for 30 days. Should the tokens deplete before the 30 day period is complete, the round
will end and the next round will begin. The first stage of the Main Event is scheduled for 1
November 2018, with stage two and three commencing on 1 December 2018 and 1 January
2019 respectively.

ENSURING DECENTRALIZATION
In an effort to protect the integrity of the VibraVid platform and prevent Beatzcoin
price manipulation, we’ll take the following steps:
1. All unsold tokens offered during the sale will be burned
2. The reserved supply of 15% will be locked until 2020
3. 67% of the tokens will be distributed to the community through airdrops, sales or as
payments for services.

FAQs
Q

Q
A
Q
A
Q
A
Will the POLS system be permanent?
The POLS system will be something that Beatzcoin holders can utilize.
We are currently developing a means to allow for permanent vesting
of Beatzcoin, without damaging the decentralized leaning of the
platform.
Where do you see the value of Beatzcoin in the future?
Ultimately, the market will determine the value of Beatzcoin at
any given time.
Who funds the bounties for average users?
Content creators have the option to offer bounties to the community.
For example, an instrumental producer can offer 1000 BTZ as a bounty,
at a rate of 1 BTZ per play/review. This will cost the content creator very
little to receive 1000 legitimate views, listens, and reviews. Also, the
VibraVid platform will be providing daily (and other timely) bounties.
What if someone uploads a 24 hour recording, where everyone can
simply ‘listen’ to and earn bounties?
We will have rules and guidelines (protocols) in place to prevent these
kinds of scams from operating.
20
BEATZCOIN.IO WHITEPAPER
Q
A
Will the VibraVid platform be a Dapp (decentralized app)?
The VibraVid platform will initially be released as a typical website
(video and audio platform), with the exception that its ecosystem
and economy will be driven by Beatzcoin, which is governed by its
own protocols. Our second phase of platform development will be
incorporating the platform to function on the blockchain. In essence,
Beatzcoin is not centralized or decentralized but rather distributed
amongst it’s creators, buyers, and users. VibraVid is a company that
will utilize blockchain and P2P technology. Unlike similar projects
or platforms, VibraVid is actually using emerging decentralized
technologies, rather than centralized cloud platforms, etc.
Q
A
Will the Beatzcoin platform take a percentage of transactions?
Yes. There will be a very small fee in some cases, similar to what you
see on most popular cryptocurrency exchanges. This small fee will be
used to fund the platform. Our long term goal, however, is to gradually
decrease expenses as we move into the second phase of development.
Q
A
Will I have to see those annoying advertisements before or during
content play, like I am used to seeing on centralized platforms?
Users and content creators will have the freedom to choose whether
or not to view or display ads. The major difference between VibraVid
and other popular audio and video platforms is the advertising
revenue share reserved for the users who choose to view ads.We will
also encourage advertisers to reward content creators. The option to
view or show ads will be left to the user and content creator. In short,
a user can opt out of viewing advertisements, or opt in and be paid
for viewing them.
21
BEATZCOIN.IO WHITEPAPER
Q
A
Q
A
Why does Beatzcoin have a total supply of 3 billion? Isn’t that a lot?
Our initial total supply and circulating supply has undergone many
revisions, and has been vetted by two separate accountants. YouTube®
alone has an average of 1 billion plays per day. When we take that into
consideration, our supply-to-use ratio actually falls short.
Where do you see VibraVid in 10 years?
As an answer to a hypothetical question, we see VibraVid as the go-to
platform for all of your entertainment needs. It is fairly decentralized,
and you can interact with the platform via its own AI (artificial
intelligence). You can purchase songs, albums, the latest movies, and
earn Beatzcoin in exchange for your participation’ or ‘while listening
and viewing promoted content The world’s most popular music artists
utilize the platform profitably and without middlemen. Cinema movies
are released straight to the VibraVid platform. The VibraVid user base
is global at over 5 billion users. Most people are subscribed to VibraVid
TV, which is the standard for all viewing pleasure. VibraVid Radio is
broadcasted with 5G, replacing what we know as FM radio...and you
get paid while listening. You go to the store and take a scan, and pay
in the popular currency. When you get home, you relax and entertain
yourself, while earning Beatzcoin, which is equally traded with that
popular currency that you just spent at your local market.
