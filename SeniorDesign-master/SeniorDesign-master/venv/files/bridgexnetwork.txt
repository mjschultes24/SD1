ABSTRACT
01
ABSTRACT
Centralised finance has reached a tipping point. The last fifteen years have seen the rise of new technologies aimed at disrupting
the old and ushering in the new. Now, more than ever, P2P lending and the applications of blockchain technology have created a
unique opportunity for financial inclusion, enabling people marginalised by the traditional financial system. The BridgeX Network
aims to be the first total solution that effectively bridges the old and the new, one that provides decentralised financial services
whilst maintaining seamless interoperability with the current system.
BridgeX Network: A Decentralised Financial Ecosystem
The BridgeX Network is the framework for a financial ecosystem of decentralised credit, conversion and payment solutions,
enabling crypto-to-crypto collateralised lending and borrowing, crypto-to-fiat currency conversions and cross border payments.
The network will unite the full spectrum of financial services players in the blockchain industry and open new opportunities
for traditional financial institutions/ services to enter and participate in this new world economy. Any third party integrator or
distributed app (DApp) developer can leverage the power of the BridgeX Network to offer new services on their existing platform
or create DApps/ Apps on the network that solve real-world financial needs.
Our goal is to have the BridgeX Network power a vast ecosystem of decentralised and off-chain crypto financial services that
will effectively democratise access to credit and bridge the divided worlds of crypto and fiat. We envision a future where the
underbanked get access to affordable credit, where cryptocurrencies are recognised as a legitimate asset to be accepted as
collateral and where there is seamless interoperability between the divided worlds of crypto and fiat.
BridgeX Core: Infrastructure for Credit, Conversion and Payment Solutions
At the heart of the BridgeX Network lies BridgeX Core. It comprises a suite of cutting-edge smart contracts hosted on the Ethereum
blockchain - an on-chain loan matching service, an on-chain loan tracking service and an oracle that collects off-chain data for the
loan contracts - and an integrated cash management module, BRIDGEPay, which provides off-chain solutions for crypto-to-fiat
conversions and cross-border payments.
BridgeX Platform: BRIDGELoan, BRIDGEConvert and BRIDGESend
As the first proof-of-concepts for this new financial ecosystem, our DApp and Apps will demonstrate the power of the BridgeX
Network at its integrated best, delivering three compelling and synergistic cash management solutions within a single platform
while providing third party integrators and DApp developers with an understanding of the multitude of possibilities going forward.
BRIDGELoan is a decentralised crypto lending marketplace offering crypto-to-crypto loans, where new opportunities are created
for lenders seeking access to an untapped and burgeoning digitally savvy market segment and where borrowers are able to
leverage their crypto assets by pledging them as collateral to secure liquidity. All loans are over-collateralised. Built on the
Ethereum blockchain and powered by BridgeX Core, BRIDGELoan allows lenders and borrowers across the globe to connect and
deal in a fully automated, cryptographically secure and transparent manner.
BRIDGEConvert and BRIDGESend work seamlessly together within the BRIDGEPay module to provide crypto-to-fiat conversions
and cross-border payment solutions. Over 30 major fiat currencies are supported with access to more than 180 countries, allowing
for a) loans originating in the blockchain space to be localised in fiat, or b) its independent deployment as a comprehensive end-
to-end cash management solution for users’ blockchain asset portfolios.

CENTRALISED FINANCE | THE RISE OF P2P LENDING

CENTRALISED FINANCE |
THE RISE OF P2P LENDING
Centralised finance has reached a tipping point. Over the last fifteen years, disruptors have focused their innovation on alternative
forms of finance and finding novel ways to reach those marginalised by the traditional financial system. This, along with the
Internet’s mainstream adoption globally, has sparked the rise of p2p lending and blockchain - the technologies and concepts
shaping the future of inclusive finance.
Centralised Finance
Control of the traditional financial system has been in the hands of a relatively small number of people since its inception. Decisions
on who can participate in the system are made within a structure heavily biased towards the financial institutions that control it
and are based solely on the ability to turn a profit from participants. The area of traditional finance where this is most clear is
credit - the re-distribution of money from those who have it to those who need it in exchange for a fee.
Banks have traditionally acted as intermediaries for these credit transactions, taking customer savings and distributing them as
loans. The borrower pays an interest rate which the bank splits between itself and the lender. Without banks, this process would
be difficult and expensive for two people to manage on their own. Additionally, the issues of trust along with the mechanics of risk,
time limits, and other terms have to be figured out.
The fact that banks have made this process easy is part of the problem. They have the ability to dictate terms and ultimately decide
who should get access to credit and who should not. Put a different way: they have become gatekeepers to the financial system,
deciding who gets to participate and what assets are deemed to be acceptable collateral. Customers that are deemed too risky for
a bank’s appetite will be ignored, so will those who have little to save and, therefore, lend. In a rising digital economy, an increasing
number of people have alternative digital assets with little banking access. This has necessarily resulted in millions of unbanked
and underbanked people across the world. A vast majority of these people desperately need access to credit in order to increase
their standard of living. But even if they were to approach a bank about a loan, they would soon realize that the crippling interest
rates on offer were beyond their ability to pay.
Looking more locally, there is also the problem of getting money from areas that have it to areas that need it. Banks focus their
attention on their own immediate area and are restricted by how much they can lend. Their risk appetite allows them to only offer
such access to credit to the lowest risk customers.
Innovations, like blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, have been slow to reach centralised finance. Western Union,
for example, has already stated that it will not be adding a cryptocurrency transfer solution in the near future.   Ripple’s chief
cryptographer has also said that banks are unwilling to create international payment solutions on the blockchain because of
scalability and privacy concerns.
Exactly because centralised finance has been slow to adapt, new financial solutions have sprung up with the promise of making
the financial system more accessible, affordable, and transparent.
P2P Lending
As early as the late 1990s, a company called Napster gave us a glimpse of what the internet could make possible. Peer-to-peer
(P2P) filesharing—the idea that anyone with a connection to the internet could share files with each other—was a revolution.
Someone sitting in Chile could share a file with someone in Estonia without the need for an intermediary.
Naturally, this concept has evolved and influenced the lending space. The elimination of banks as intermediaries meant that
interest rates and costs associated with bureaucracy decreased, money was available at any time regardless of geography, and
more people had conceivable access to credit. The democratisation of credit was suddenly a legitimate possibility.

CENTRALISED FINANCE | THE RISE OF P2P LENDING
P2P lending is not without its problems, though. Distribution of money still required access to the centralised financial system.
Currency exchange services were often required, same with bank accounts. This had to be done manually because no platform
provided complete integration. In addition, the risk was transferred away from the intermediary and put squarely on the lender.
This made things difficult because lenders were not always equipped to handle credit risk evaluation or did not have the means of
recourse to defaults. Lenders were, therefore, put in an awkward situation in which they needed to trust a borrower who they had
never met to re-pay the loans. To-date, this remains too great a risk for many to embrace and participate in P2P lending.
Still, Morgan Stanley has projected the global p2p lending marketplace to reach US$290 billion by 2020, with an annual growth
rate of 51%.

Of this marketplace, the cryptocurrency p2p lending market is still at its infancy; This represents an enormous business opportunity.
Opportunity
The rise of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have created a unique opportunity: Over-collateralised P2P lending with
a bridge to the services provided by centralised FinTech. It is a way for anyone to participate in a decentralised financial system,
whether it be loans, cross-border payments, or currency conversion, without the need for direct interaction with the traditional
banking system.
Challenges
Despite the significant growth in value of and confidence in the cryptocurrency markets, fiat currencies remain the prevailing
instruments for the bulk of all transactions and loan collaterals that occur globally today.
Similar to traditional investors in the fiat world, cryptocurrency investors often have the need for:
• Real world cash flow
• International payments
With the number of cryptocurrency investors increasing exponentially, the need for conversions of crypto into fiat currencies also
increases in tandem.
Today, cryptocurrencies are still a very illiquid instrument and converting crypto assets into fiat for real-world personal and
business needs is proving to be an increasingly cumbersome process. Fiat liquidity covers short-term obligations and a business’
working capital needs and is essential especially when cryptocurrency investors require short-term financing. Individuals and
businesses with growing blockchain asset portfolios would increasingly run into difficulty should their most significant asset be
tied to a specific cryptocurrency - with no or very little liquidity.

CENTRALISED FINANCE | THE RISE OF P2P LENDING
The BridgeX Network aims to solve two of the biggest challenges facing the blockchain and cryptocurrency space:
1. Access to Credit
Today, most banks and financial institutions hold traditional assets like property, land and gold as collateral for their loan and
financing services. Even with a total market capitalisation of USD 300 billion and rising, cryptocurrencies remain an unrecognised
asset class by the traditional financial system. Accordingly, banks and financial institutions remain a closed door for holders
of cryptocurrency assets. Yet, the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a valid asset class continues to grow. The problem that
cryptocurrency holders face - having little/no means to unlock their crypto portfolio - will only get worse.
2. Access to the Traditional World of Fiat
Cryptocurrencies are currently being traded in a world of their own. For holders to unlock their cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies
to make necessary international payments is not only troublesome, but also costly.
This is especially true for companies that have just held a token sale. With the funds raised in their ICO campaign, they need
to make payouts for their marketing and PR cost, legal fees, development work, and so on. On top of that, they also require fiat
currencies to sustain their day-to-day operations. The current process requires holders to transfer their cryptocurrencies from
their wallet to an exchange, the conversion of their crypto assets into fiat, the withdrawal to a company’s own bank account, and
then any required transfers are made from there. These steps take days and often require a litany of fees along the way.
This lengthy process is made even more cumbersome due to:
• Different crypto exchanges having different limitations and different technical difficulty levels
• Crypto exchanges are unlikely to support smaller markets: Crypto holders in these smaller markets are unable to make
withdrawals in their home currencies

THE BRIDGEX NETWORK
Selected Use Cases | Key Benefits
Individual Lenders
The BridgeX Network democratises lending for all, customarily the preserve of financial institutions or accredited lenders.
Individuals can now participate as lenders in a 2-sided loans marketplace, BRIDGELoan, on the BridgeX Network. Lending allows
individuals to diversify their crypto portfolio exposure, lower risks and earn a steady income, with our suite of smart contracts
making this process quick, easy and fuss-free.
Individual Borrowers
• Gain access to affordable credit via a collateral-based assessment with no credit scoring/ checks
• Avoid Tax Events by obtaining short/mid-term liquidity without a sale of crypto assets
• Avoid inflated exchange fees
• Maintain unlimited upside potential of crypto assets
Long Term "HODL-er" Investors
The market for cryptocurrencies has grown to a whopping USD 300 billion and is still expected to grow, with the number of
wallet users having also grown exponentially to over 22 million users globally in January 2018. There is an increasing number of
cryptocurrency investors who have a significant portion of their wealth locked up in crypto assets but need immediate liquidity for
real-world needs. Collateralised loans on the BridgeX Network allow them to unlock liquidity without sacrificing the unlimited
upside potential of their crypto assets.
The BridgeX Network will allow individuals to then deal seamlessly with their newly unlocked liquidity on a single platform user
interface, powered by the network’s integrated crypto-to-fiat conversions and cross-border payments Apps.
Miners
Miners power the decentralised blockchain world and are rewarded in turn with the cryptocurrencies they power. With the overall
appreciation in value of cryptocurrencies, miners have benefited greatly from holding their crypto assets. Collateralised loans on
the BridgeX Network allows miners to access working capital to address immediate cash flow needs to stay competitive and run
their costly hardware-intensive operations without needing to sell their crypto assets. With such a loan, miners are also able to
hedge against downside risks without sacrificing the unlimited upside potential of their crypto assets.
Via the network’s integrated crypto-to-fiat conversions and cross-border payments Apps, miners can subsequently encash their
newly unlocked crypto liquidity into fiat and make payments globally for hardware, salaries and service providers etc. on a single
platform user interface.
Successfully ICO-ed Crypto Companies
Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have proven to be an effective way for companies in the blockchain industry to raise funds. Often
raising in ETH terms, companies need to protect the value of their funds raised against market volatility. Companies also have
immediate cash flow needs for product development and operational costs. Collateralised loans on the BridgeX Network allow
companies to achieve both these objectives without sacrificing the unlimited upside potential of their crypto assets.
Further, an ICO’s developmental and operational costs often require payments to be made in various currencies to multiple
beneficiaries/ service providers around the world. The BridgeX Network will allow participant companies to enjoy this seamless
process of crypto-to-fiat conversions and cross-border payments, becoming a one-stop end-to-end cash management solution.

BRIDGEX CORE
At the heart of the BridgeX Network lies BridgeX Core. It comprises a suite of cutting-edge smart contracts hosted on the Ethere-
um blockchain - an on-chain loan matching service, an on-chain loan tracking service and an oracle that collects off-chain data for
the loan contracts - and an integrated cash management module, BRIDGEPay, which provides off-chain solutions for crypto-to-fi-
at conversions and cross-border payments.
Our BridgeX Platform will be built atop and powered by this core infrastructure. Any third party integrator or distributed app
(DApp) developer can seamlessly integrate with BridgeX Core via an application program interface (API) to offer new services on
their existing platform to their clients or create any number of multi-faceted financial services within the BridgeX Network.

Once a loan is matched and executed by the on-chain SMARTMatch smart-contract, it will be tracked by the SMARTTrack smart-
contract.
SMARTTrack uses external data feed from the SMARTOracle to mark-to-market the loan valuation and Loan-To-Value (LTV) ratio.

Thereafter, the SMARTTrack smart-contract will manage and automatically take all appropriate actions for:
• Collateral & Asset Locking;
• Disbursement of Funds;
• Repayment Tracking;
• LTV Ratio Tracking; and
• Distribution of Interest & Fees.
Lender Wallet
Initiation
Once a loan is matched by the SMARTMatch smart-contract, the collateral from the borrowers will be officially locked up, and
the loan asset from the lender will be disbursed to the borrower. The borrower has the option of keeping his loan in crypto, using
BRIDGEConvert to convert his loan into fiat and/ or sending the fiat out to himself or to his beneficiaries.
Liquidation
Base on price feed from the SMARTOracle, SMARTrack will take the appropriate liquidation action should the LTV reach 95%. This
will terminate the loan transaction and return the loan asset to the Lender, and the remaining collateral assets to the borrower.
Repayment
All repayments sent by the borrower will have:
a.                                                                                                                                     The fees sent to BridgeX Core;
b.                                                                                                                                     The principal and interest elements to the Lender; and
c.                                                                                                                                     The remaining to the collateral wallet.
Termination
At the end of the loan, all the remaining collateral will be returned to the borrower, and the lending asset returned to the lender.
The loan transaction is now completed.
Risk Management
The BridgeX Core will deploy a rigorous three-level risk management system in a top-down approach that will manage risks in a
secure and watertight manner.

BRIDGEX CORE
LTV ratios are derived from volatility and dynamically fluctuates according to market conditions.
Margin Call
Margin levels are set according to levels derived from volatility calculations and this proprietary formula is pre-programmed into
the smart contracts. If the value of the borrower’s collateral depreciates below a dynamically-determined threshold, a margin
call notice is issued to the borrower. The borrower can choose to repay in fiat the requisite portion of his loan to maintain the
required LTV level, top up his crypto-collateral to maintain the required LTV level or ignore the margin call where the smart
contract will automatically initiate the liquidation of his collateral for rebalancing of the loan once the value of his collateral hits
the predetermined liquidation level.
Liquidation Level
Liquidation levels are also derived from volatility calculations and this proprietary formula is pre-programmed into the smart
contracts. When the value of the borrower’s collateral reaches this level, BridgeX Core will be granted ownership over the collateral
and the fiat loan to the borrower is forfeited.
Liquidation occurs through an automated trading engine, which utilizes proprietary investment logic to optimize trade execution
based on real time available liquidity, order book depth and price through the cryptocurrency exchange aggregator.
SMARTOracle
SMARTOracle is an open source aggregator that aggregates off-chain data feed from multiple sources and supplies this information
to SMARTTrack to inform and allow SMARTTrack to mark-to-market the loan valuation and Loan-To-Value (LTV) ratio.
BRIDGEPay
Matching Engine
The proprietary Matching Engine within BridgeX Core enables the pairing up of different orders of transactions between users.  It
aggregates the best bid/ offer prices (as shown in diagram below) from the LPs and matches it with the orders of the clients. This
technology allows BridgeX Core to offer the best rates in the market to the clients. The infrastructure is robust and BridgeX Core
systems are connected via API with the liquidity providers. This allows transactions to be done via STP where a dealing desk will
not be required. Rates are updated in real-time and are transparent.

Benefits to Lenders and Borrows
BRIDGELoan will make it easy for anyone with crypto collateral to participate.
Lenders can monetise their cryptocurrency assets by earning a steady income from them, earn interest without sacrificing the
upside of their crypto-collateral, and feel secure knowing that all loans are over-collateralised.
Borrows can obtain liquidity without sacrificing the upside of their crypto-collateral, leverage their positions in bullish markets,
borrow to short the market and hedge their cryptocurrency portfolios.
Lending Process
As an open and decentralised loan marketplace, BRIDGELoan allows lenders to place loan offers based on their requirements and
browse borrowers’ loan requests via the loan order book and take up a request that meets their requirements
Loan Offer Placement
Offer placement is equivalent to a Limit trade order in trading. A loan can be taken-up in its entirety or in parts (split by multiple
borrowers). The BRIDGELoan keeps tract of each split, with each borrowing having its own full transaction ledger.
Loan offers can be set with the following characteristics:
a. Loan tenure (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months)
b. Lending asset (initially ETH or BXN)
c. Interest Rate (365/360 calculation model)
d. Selectable minimum LTV ratio (Need to guide lender for selecting P+I, same/cross asset)
e. Offer Quantity
f. Offer expiry date (how long will the loan be offered before being automatically retracted)
g. Early repayment penalty
h. Allow partial take-up (Yes/No)
As each characteristic is specified, BRIDGELoan will show a list of existing loan requests in the marketplace that fit the lender’s
specified criteria.
To place an offer, the lender will send the full quantity of cryptocurrency into the BRIDGELoan smart-contract to ensure that the
lender has the offered asset.
A platform (administrative) fee of 0.1% to be paid in BXN will be charged from the lender’s wallet account when the offer is placed.
This is to encourage only genuine offers and to pay for gas fees for publishing the Loan Offer to the blockchain.
The BRIDGELoan smart-contract will hold the offered asset until the expiry date or until the lender retracts the offer, at which
point the smart-contract will return all unmatched assets to the lender.
Once placed, the BRIDGELoan smart-contract will automatically match it against registered Loan Requests and spawn a new Loan
transaction/ Loan transactions if the Loan Offer can match multiple Loan Requests. This process will be elaborated in detail in
the Matching section.
Loan Request Take-Up
As an alternative to the Offer Placement process, a lender can view the Loan Requests list, and instantly take-up (offer to lend)
any Loan Request(s) on the spot.
This is equivalent to Market trade order.

BRIDGEX PLATFORM
Upon taking up the Loan Request, BRIDGELoan will automatically generate a Loan Offer and inject it into the smart-contract for
immediate matching.
The platform (administrative) fee to be paid in BXN will be charged to the lender’s wallet account.
Borrowing Process
Borrowers can choose to:
• Place their own Loan Request specifying the borrower’s chosen terms; or
• Take up Loan Offers from the loan order book.
Loan Request Placement
Request placement is similar to the Offer placement process.
Loan Requests can be set with the following characteristics:
a. Loan tenure (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months)
b. Collateral asset
c. Interest Rate (365/360 calculation model)
d. Request Amount
e. Request expiry date (how long will the request be placed before being automatically retracted)
f. Early repayment penalty
g. System will automatically calculate the monthly repayment schedule.
When the Loan Request is placed, a platform (administrative) fee of 0.1% to be paid in BXN will be charged from the borrower’s
wallet account. This is to encourage only genuine requests and to pay for gas fees for publishing the Loan Request to the blockchain.
Loan Offer Take-Up
Borrowers can also view the Loan Offer list, and instantly take-up any Loan Offer(s) on the spot.
Upon taking up the Loan Offer, BRIDGELoan will automatically generate a Loan Request and inject it into the smart-contract for
immediate matching.
The platform (administrative) fee to be paid in BXN will be charged to the borrower’s wallet account.

How BRIDGELoan Works

                                                                                                                                          Loan Terms     Bid / Offer     Matching   of Funds       (Borrower)
Step 1: Funding
Borrowers and Lenders fund their BridgeX wallets by depositing accepted cryptocurrencies. No fiat currencies are accepted as
deposits.
Step 2: Selection of Loan Terms
Borrowers and Lenders indicate their preferences such as type of crypto-collateral (e.g. ETH), loan amount, loan tenure, interest
rate and repayment frequency. Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, margin call and liquidation levels will be automatically calculated based
on the above user inputs.
All terms of the loan will be governed by rules pre-programmed into the smart contract based on the above user selection.
Step 3: Invitation to Bid / Offer
To initiate a bid (borrower) or offer (lender), users would then have to fund a smart contract, where the borrower pledges his
decided amount of cryptocurrency to be used as collateral and where the Lender sends in the amount of cryptocurrency he wishes
to lend. A small placement fee is charged for placing a Loan Offer/ Loan Request
Step 4: Instant Matching
BridgeX Core’s proprietary AI-based matching engine will instantly match borrower and lender preferences and lock-in the loan
contract.
Step 5: Disbursement of Funds
After the parties have been matched, the blockchain assets placed as collateral by the borrower will be held securely in the smart
contract, while the lender’s funds are immediately unlocked and released to the borrower via his BridgeX wallet.
Step 6: Use of Funds (Borrower)
After receiving his loan funds in the denominated cryptocurrency, the borrower may choose to:
a.    Use these crypto funds in the blockchain space; or
b.    Convert these crypto funds into the fiat currency of his choice for his real-world needs.
Step 7: Loan Period
During the period of the loan, the LTV ratio dynamically fluctuates in sync with market movements and margin calls may be issued
to the borrower. The borrower can choose to:
a.    Repay in fiat the requisite portion of his loan to maintain the required LTV level;
b.    Top up his crypto-collateral to maintain the required LTC level; or
c.    Ignore the margin call and have his crypto-collateral partially liquidated for rebalancing of the loan to the required LTV level.
Step 8: Loan Repayment
The borrower may choose to:
a.    Repay the loan in full with fiat at any point in time to fully redeem the loan and retrieve his crypto-collateral; or
b.    Repay the loan with his crypto-collateral, whereby any balances will be refunded to his BridgeX wallet.

Utility
6.1 Access
The BXN token provides a way for the ecosystem of a) users of our BridgeX Platform and its DApp/ Apps, b) third-party integrators/
DApps/ service providers and c) their users to access the services on our network.
6.2 Membership
The BridgeX Network will operate a tiered membership system with a finite number of memberships and built-in incentives to
encourage greater BXN ownership and demand for higher-tier memberships among network participants.
6.3 Incentivising BXN Usage
Network Fees
Network participants who pay for services on the BridgeX Network in BXN tokens will enjoy discounted network fees. That
said, network fees can also be paid in ETH or such other accepted cryptocurrencies going forward, which will be immediately
converted to BXN. Fee amounts will be determined by the prevailing market price of BXN and the value difference of the accepted

TOKEN DISTRIBUTION
cryptocurrency compared to BXN. The fee and discount structures will be tiered in line with memberships, with higher tiers
gaining preferential access to bigger discounts on network fees.
When BXN is added to a collateral portfolio and activated, the small placement fee charged for placing a Loan Offer or Loan
Request will be discounted. Activating a sufficient amount of BXN will allow users to enjoy a full waiver of this fee, allowing them
to place multiple Loan Offers or Requests for free.
Lending Asset
Lenders on the network will enjoy zero-fee lending if BXN is used as the loan asset.
Loan Collateral
Borrowers on the network will enjoy zero-fee borrowing if BXN is used as the loan collateral. As an added incentive to use BXN as
the loan collateral, the permitted loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for borrowers will be increased by up to 5%, giving borrowers access to
more liquidity for the same loan collateral pledged.
Accessing lower interest rates
When BXN is added to a collateral portfolio and activated, borrowers unlock access to preferential interest rates.
Loan Repayment
Loan Repayment can be made using BXN. Alternatively, borrowers can choose to repay the loan in fiat or with their crypto collateral
(which may be BXN), with any balances refunded to their BridgeX wallet.
Burning of BXN
All fees collected by the BridgeX Network will be held and burnt periodically.
Earning Rewards
To encourage user adoption, reward points will be given to users for:
• Network Usage - Every time a service on the network is used;
• Community Participation - In community surveys on our feedback portal; and
• Referrals - Successful introductions of new active users to the network.
These reward points can be accumulated and used to redeem items from our gift shop, ranging from cryptocurrencies to discount
coupons that can be used in the future for the network’s services.
Retail Partnerships
To create a vibrant financial ecosystem where users can utilise their BXN tokens, we intend to establish partnerships with the full
spectrum of financial services players in the cryptocurrency space to accept BXN tokens as payment.
Creating Value
In addition to enjoying the abovementioned incentives upon their purchase and activation of BXN tokens, users of the BXN token
will drive further growth of the BridgeX Network and ensure sustained demand for the BXN token, creating value for every network
participant.
