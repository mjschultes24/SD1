ABSTRACT
A New Wave of Creative Innovation is Upon Us
The way we create content, consume content and exchange content has
been  completely  disrupted  by  demographic  shifts,  social  media  and
technological advances in a mobile-centric world.   The increased appetite
for  on-demand  content  coupled  with  the  emergence  of  blockchain
technology creates a unique opportunity for creative talents to   fully exploit
their creative contributions as well as monetize their intellectual property
through a completely transparent and fair smart contract system.
Up until this point, there have been significant barriers that limit both the
access to markets as well as the income generated by creative content.   The
power was concentrated in the hands of a few big players who had both the
means to reach audiences as well as the resources to create and distribute
content.    The  convergence  of  mobile,  technological  advancements  and
blockchain technology is unleashing a new wave of creative innovation and
18moons is at the forefront of this trend.
As an established media company with a mobile distribution network that is
already   delivering   aggregated   preschool   content   for   broadcasters,
telecommunication companies and smart tvs partners, we want to usher in
the next wave of creative content that will be unlocked with augmented and
mixed  reality  technology  by  leveraging  the  Etherium  blockchain  to
incentivize, track and reward creative talents through a robust digital rights
management solution.
Pending a successful crowdsale, we will utilize a “Call for Content” to expand
our content offerings in Planet Kids as we roll out our mobile platform
globally.  We will be utilizing a collaborative design and development system
to  create  and  deliver  a  series  of  augmented  reality  adventures  for
preschoolers that will be made available to over  30 million households
through our partner network. Creative contributions by independent talents
will  be  tracked  and  paid  through  a  smart  contract  system  to  bring
transparency  to  the  digital  content  community  while  opening  up  new
sources of revenue.
Our  token  crowdsale  will  bring  instant  utility  to  both  the  creative
community who want to participate in the development of multi-media
content   as well as our end consumers, parents and kids, who will benefit
from  the  ever-changing  universe  of  global,  local  and  original  content
available on demand and the augmented reality adventures which will be
unlocked through the use of our tokens, Planet Kids Coins (PKC).

INTRODUCTION
Follow The Fun, Find The Learning!
18moons’ core mission is to to enrich the lives of Preschool Families. We do
this   by   providing   aggregrated,   customizable,   learning-through-play
experiences through a mobile platform called Planet Kids. We make it easy
for parents, grandparents, caretakers and kids to access an ever-changing
universe of global, local and original content to help preschool kids develop
language  learning,  social-emotional  and  cognitive  development  skills
through play-based experiences. Our platform allows parents and caretakers
to manage screen time as well as select language and content preferences
through a subscription service. A blockchain solution will provide us with
the  means  to  meet  the  increased  demand  for  interactive,  multi-media
content as we roll-out our platform globally.
We also recognize that the development of consumer-oriented Augmented
Reality (AR) applications is growing rapidly and lots of new use cases are
being    explored.    AR    technology    essentially    superimposes    a
computer-generated image on a user’s view of the real world through a
smartphone   or   tablet,   thus   providing   a   composite   view   using
computer-generated sensory inputs such as sound, video, graphics or GPS
data to enhance the experience. New research from the International Data
Corporation (IDC) forecasts that global revenues for AR and Mixed Reality
(MR)  will  reach  143.3  billion  USD  by  2020  with  the  consumer  market
occupying the largest segment.
We believe that the Planet Kids platform can tap into this potential and
support the expanded use of augmented and mixed reality experiences in
ways that significantly enhance entertainment and learning.   We will utilize
our Decentralized App (DApp) running on the Ethereum blockchain to track
and manage usage and compensation of multi-media content delivered in
the Planet Kids platform.

1 - AUGMENTED REALITY ADVENTURES
- CALL FOR CONTENT
Our ZOGO’S Adventure App will be the next generation experience in the
Planet Kids platform. The app will utilize AR to bring learning- through- play
to a whole new level, through immersive adventures that encourage kids to
be  curious  and  explore  objects  around  them  as  they  participate  in  an
adventure with ZOGO. The AR technology allows ZOGO to leap off the
screen and into the playroom to interact with kids using multi-sensory
activities via themed adventures that ZOGO will take them on, with a green
screen-like background. We will utilize a “Call for Content” to help us source
a wide variety of multi-media experiences in ZOGO’S Adventures, using our
blockchain solution to support this process.
1.2 - BLOCKCHAIN JUSTIFICATION
The  Ethereum  blockchain  has  the  capability  to  provide  integrity  and
transparency for financial transactions as well as for intellectual property
rights for independent artists. The immutable and public nature of the
blockchain provides an ideal foundation for all functions relating to the
sourcing, utilization, protection and payment involved with independent
content creation. Functionally, the Ethereum blockchain, with its smart
contract system ensures that producers and content developers will be paid
for their contribution automatically and transparently.
3




All intellectual property rights are preserved and stored on the blockchain.
The use of blockchain technology mitigates costs, streamlines the process of
protecting and accessing intellectual property rights, and eliminates the
need for 3rd parties, such as lawyers, and payment processors.
The overall collaborative design and distribution of intellectual property, and
payout would not be possible without the use of blockchain technology.
Blockchain’s  ability  to  bundle  packets  of  information  that  contain  time
stamped intellectual property records, autonomous payout instructions, and
contract conditions is the key ingredient. A standard use token, our Planet
Kids Coin (PKC) is required to facilitate global content distribution and create
frictionless value transfer and payment processing. The decentralized nature
of  the  blockchain  in  this  case  allows  for  a  fairer  and  more  equitable
environment  for  everyone  involved.  While  competitors  have  developed
systems to leverage some of this functionality, today there is no current
system, process or effective means that supports global co- development
and  distribution of content on  this  scale until now.
This use case of the blockchain provides immense value to independent
content creators for their creative contributions in real time, wherever they
may be located. Our utilization of smart contracts will introduce industry-first
functionality  such  as  fully  transparent  autonomous  royalty  payout,  and
automatic payment to artists pending the usage of their media within the
Planet Kids Ecosystem. Blockchain facilitates scaling content contracts, and
providing  dynamic  rewards  for  artists  instead  of  fixed  price  schedules.
Content developer contracts can be adjusted via predetermined parameters,
allowing for scaling bonuses in payout or increased visibility in the Planet Kids
Universe after a certain threshold usage has been reached. This system will
benefit creatives who develop the most engaging content while keeping the
playing field open and equitable for all. It is for these reasons that we believe
our decentralized app (DApp) can benefit from, as well as add value, to the
broader blockchain ecosystem.

2 - PRODUCTS
The Planet Kids platform consists of three products:
(1)                                                                                   Planet Kids App
(2)                                                                                   Parentarium
(3)                                                                                   ZOGO’s Adventures (contingent on ICO success)
2.1 - PLANET KIDS APP
The well-established and award-winning Planet Kids App has more than 600
of  the  most  beloved  videos,  children’s  videos,  books,  games,  music  and
interactive   activities   for   preschool   families   to   enjoy   based   on   a
learning-through-play paradigm. It is easy-to-use, safe, and provides parents
and  caregivers  with  tools  for  managing  screen  time  and  language
preferences.
The App is currently available in app stores   and   smart   TVs   through   large
strategic partners in Latin America. Our aggregation model easily integrates
and distributes global,   local   and   original   content   through a proprietary
content  management  system  and  strategic partner network. The content is
currently available in English, Spanish and Portuguese, but we anticipate
rolling out additional languages.

As   the   world   is   becoming   increasingly   globalized,   we   believe   the   next
generation will prosper from the ability to   engage   and communicate in
multiple languages. The Planet Kids media platform is  the ideal tool for kids
of preschool age to access content that will help develop dual language
learning skills, gain insights into other countries cultures, and have fun at the
same time. The blockchain solution we are developing will help us to source,
track and manage an ever-changing array of content, while reducing the
number of third parties needed to uphold such a model.

Payment Management
Our existing content library, our relationships with content providers and
our  extensive  partner  distribution  network  provide  a  solid  foundation on
which to implement blockchain technology. Our utilization consolidates both
payments  and  IP  records  into  our  blockchain  solution,  which  allows  for
content creators not currently using the blockchain to be co- opted into our
solution. Attempting to implement a blockchain solution for IP management
without said institution   would   require   all   parties   involved to already be
utilizing  the  blockchain, a challenge in and of  itself. We are ready to bring IP
functionality to the Ethereum blockchain by utilizing PKC tokens and our
closed DApp ecosystem.

- TOKEN CROWDSALE
This section will explain the specifics of how the crowdsale will be organized
and structured and how one will be able to participate.
- SMART CONTRACT
Some of the most profound risks for creative artists and developers are the
extent to which their rights, such as intellectual property, will be preserved.
The special purpose code in our Smart Contract ensures that no central
authority has the possibility to utilize or trade what is not theirs, and that the
agreed upon terms and conditions will be executed. Unlike the existing
industry model, where content use can go unnoticed and unpaid, this use of
smart  contracts  allows  for  a  failsafe  that  benefits  creative  producers.  If
content is used without pay or permission, the breach of the smart contract
is automatically visible on the network. This insures integrity on the part of
18moons   and   represents   a   true   democratization   of   both   content
development and distribution. By handling royalty payouts and tracking via
the smart contract, we also open up possibilities for 3rd party licensing. By
co-opting additional brands into the 18moons creative content aggregation
platform we can increase exposure and payout for creative talents.
- CROWD SALE STRUCTURE
The   initial   price   of   the   PKC   token   is   $0.10≈ 0.00033 ETH.   Our   funding
goal   and     the crowdsale cap is $10 million with a minimum of $1 million.
Early  birds are rewarded through our two-tier bonus structure with a limit of
6.5MM bonus tokens:
0-50,000,000 PKC                                                                            10% bonus tokens
50,000,000-100,000,000 PKC                                                                  3% bonus tokens
After the token sale, the token value will be based on the price traded on
cryptocurrency  exchanges.  We  are  in  preliminary  talks  with  several
exchanges in preparation of our upcoming ICO as we understand this to be
both a crucial part of the offering and a significant pain point in most token
releases.

- BLOCKCHAIN IMPLEMENTATION
Planet Kids Coins will be implemented as an Ethereum-based token on the
Ethereum  blockchain.  Planet  Kids  Coins  comply  with  the  ERC20  token
standard.
While we are implementing our token on the Ethereum blockchain, if   we
deem that another blockchain gains more robust support, we will transfer
tokens on a 1:1 basis to said blockchain. This ensures that there is
no loss of value in terms of PKC utility.
- TOTAL SUPPLY
A maximum of 125,000,000 PKC   will   be   issued.   Ethereum   blockchain
totals can be stored on the blockchain up to 18 decimal places. Thus the
smallest unit for PKC is  0.000000000000000001 PKC.100,000,000 will be
released to the general public, 6.5MM will be released in crowdsale  bonuses,
and the remaining balance 18.5MM PKC (14.8%) will be reserved  to  support
the ecosystem.
- NON-INFLATION
We understand that inflation would hurt the value of PKC and its utility to
our users. The smart contract we have created will prohibit new tokens from
being created, thus mitigating inflation problems.
- COMMUNITY
Building and maintaining an active community is  an  important  facet  of our
ICO   development. We will foster discussion on platforms such as Reddit,
Facebook and Bitcointalk in a variety of languages. This will help to build a
truly global user base,    democratize creative content development, and
ensure that children involved with ZOGO’s adventures and the entire Planet
Kids Universe foster an open-minded and inclusive mindset. In short, we
seek to nurture and develop the global citizens of tomorrow.
- COMPLIANCE
The  Crypto-currency  market  space  is  relatively  young,    and  the Ethereum
blockchain may be subject to fundamental changes. Thus, we want to state
that there are no guarantees of any form, and that contents in this document
do  not  constitute  legal  advice.  There  is  also  uncertainty  regarding  the
applicability of US securities regulations for ICOs.

In the case of the 18moons ICO we refer to the Howey Test SEC v. Howey:
1946). We believe that   PKC’s do not pass the Howey Test (SEC v. Howey:
1946) it because: 1) ownership of PKC does not translate to any ownership or
related rights such as equity in the 18moons parent company, 2) PKC have
real utility via the Planet Kids platform, and 3) PKC primarily serve as in-app
credits rather than a financial instrument and/or speculative holdings.
We strongly recommend that prospective token holders seek legal counsel.
We do, however believe strongly in the value and lifespan of our product,
including both its blockchain functionality and the subscription/content
submission utility of our token.
- USE OF FUNDING
The funding received will be used to fuel the development and maintenance
of the platform.

team
The existing structure of 18moons as an established media company allows
us to focus more funds towards fleshing out ZOGO’s adventures, the creative
content  ecosystem,  and  content  acquisition.  In  order  to  add  value  for
content  creators  we  will  focus  significant  funding  towards  furthering
strategic partnerships. These additional partnerships will broaden our reach
and get content submitted in front of larger global audiences.
- TOKEN DISTRIBUTION
The first allocation of tokens will be the crowdsale wherein 85.2% of the total
supply of tokens will be distributed to interested participants. At this
time, 18moons will keep a minimum 14.8% to ensure a continuous vested
interest in the wellbeing of the network. If the 18moons team deems that
the demand exists we will consider opening a token presale.

- ICO ECOSYSTEM
One  of  the  major  advantages  of  operating  our  intellectual  property
management via   the Ethereum   blockchain   lies   in    mitigating    third-party
validation    systems,    while    maintaining competitive processing speeds and
costs     for PKC tokens. The Planet Kids ecosystem has in-bound streams of
tokens from subscribers and content developers, and out-bound streams of
tokens   as   compensation   to   content developers. 18moons will target   to
keep  approximately 25% of the total supply of tokens within  the ecosystem.
This target arises from the initial 14.8% kept by the 18moons team, as well as
the activation of subscriptions and submission of content as the system gains
traction.
