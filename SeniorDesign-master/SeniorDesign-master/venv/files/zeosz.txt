The
Future
Of
Banking
1 ABSTRACT
The Blockchain technology is taken
seriously by the financial sector, as it
can become a major disruptor of the
traditional banking sector.
The unchanging and inviolable nature of
the blockchain makes it the ideal solution
to reduce costs and simplify everything
from payments to transactions, securities
issues, retail banking, clearing, settlement,
etc.
It is becoming clear that the blockchain
technology is much more than Bitcoin or
cryptocurrencies. While implementations
such as payment and monetary systems
are certainly disruptive, the greatest
disruption could come from other uses
of these unique and powerful features.
zeosX is a decentralized crypto bank aiming
to revolutionize the traditional banking
industry. Our cutting-edge technological
system is built based on a powerful finance
ecosystem which consists of futuristic
banking components.
1. Borrow with or without collateral
2. Superior crypto mobile wallet
3. Luxurious and stunning quality cards
4. Investments, auction, and lending
Taking a cue from cryptocurrencies, we can
see, as stated below, the problems it has
solved in general.
 6
1.1 Why Choose zeosX Platform?
Real-time military grade security
Platform security will always be our top priority. zeosX consists of multiple layers of protection, providing
clients with seamless user experiences.
High-performance crypto fortress
Clients’ crypto assets will be safely secured in a cold storage vault. Confidential information can never be
accessed by anyone.
Monthly ZeoAirdrops
Beside producing monthly passive income, ZEOS tokens also offer clients with bountiful benefits such as
additional discounts on collateral loan.

7
1.2 Vision and Mission
The reason why cryptocurrencies have not achieved mainstream adoption is that the majority of people still think of them only as
another store of value, a risky investment and nothing else. The truth is, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are much more than that...
Vision Statement
Not only does zeosX offer banking security with countless added benefits, but it is also created to rewrite history and to change
people perception of cryptocurrencies. With zeosX, there is no need for traditional banks and third-party payment networks
anymore as our banking components are equipped with the latest groundbreaking finance technologies. From taking a loan, online
shopping to even paying for coffee, we have got everything covered.
With the gradual decline in the number of users using traditional banking, zeosX will expand even at a faster rate as cryptocurrencies
continue to grow. We are expecting more than 50 million users in the next 3 years.
Mission Statement
With zeosX, our goal is to implement Blockchain technology to ultimately achieve a decentralized and cashless society without
relying on trusted third parties such as banks. Also, tools such as smart contracts promise to automate many problematic processes
in the banking sectors, from compliance and processing requirements to content distributions.

1.3 The Need For Blockchain Technology
1. Cross-border transactions and payments
Today, Trillions of dollars are distributed throughout the world thanks to the traditional system of slow payment and additional
fees.
If you work in San Francisco and want to send money to your family in London, you may have to pay a $25 transfer fees, with an
additional service charge of up to 7%.
Besides paying all the heavy fees and with the cut-off times between yours and the receiving bank, your family will not receive
the money until a week later.
Typical transaction costs for senders are 7.68%, which consist of unnecessary payments such as transfer fees or hidden margin
gains. Facilitating payments is very profitable for all the centralized banks which give them very little incentives to reduce their
rates. Cross-border transactions, from payment to letter of credit, accounted for 40% of the total revenues of global payment
transactions in 2016.
Solution:
By eliminating the need for agents to approve consumer-to-consumer transactions, blockchain technology could allow for faster
payments at lower rates than banks.
2. Clearances and settlements systems
The fact that the average bank transfers, as described above, take at least three days to complete have a lot to do with the way
in which our slow financial infrastructure was built.
It is not just a pain for the consumers. Moving money around the world has always been a logical nightmare for the banks
themselves.
Today, a simple bank transfer, from one account to another, must bypass the complex system of intermediaries and the corresponding
banks before arriving at any destinations. The two banks must be reconciled through a global financial system consisting of a vast
network of merchants, funds, asset managers, etc.
Solution:
Blockchain technology and distributed accounting can reduce operating costs and allows transactions in real-time between
financial institutions.
3. Securities
To buy or sell assets such as stocks, debts, and commodities, you need a way to know who owns that particular asset. The financial
markets today achieve this also through a complex chain of intermediaries, stock exchanges, central security deposits,
compensations, and deposit banks. These different parts were built around an obsolete and traditional system.
Suppose if you want to buy some of Apple’s stocks, you can place your order through the stock exchange that needs many
complicated confidential pieces of information before you can complete the sign-up process. In the past, you have to call the
sellers just to buy a certificate of ownership of shares.
This is much more complex when you try to perform the transaction electronically. Thus, we do not want to deal with the daily
management of assets, such as the exchange of certificates, accounting or dividend management. Therefore, we have subdivided
the deposit actions to the custodian banks. Buyers and sellers do not need to always make the same depositaries of trust as they
have to rely on a trusted third party to keep all certificates on paper.
 9
In practice, this means that whenever you buy or sell assets, this order is transmitted by a group of third parties. The transfer of
ownership is complicated because each party has to keep their version of the truth in the book.
This system is not only inefficient but also imprecise. Security transactions can take between one to three days to settle because
all the books must be updated and aligned at the end of the day. And because many different parties are involved, transactions
often have to be verified manually, with each party charging a fee too.
Solution:
By tokenizing traditional securities such as stocks, bonds, and alternative assets, we aim to use the blockchain technology to
revolutionize the structure of capital markets.
Overall, with the integration of blockchain into the zeosX platform, we will quickly ease the process of banking while disrupting
the financial sector at large.
We are giving everyone an equal opportunity to be a part of this financial revolution as we aim to offer the ZEOS token in exchange
for cash or fiat currencies from our special investors around the world.
 10
2 PROBLEM ANALYSIS
The World Bank is currently an industry of $134 Trillion. The promise of blockchain as a technology without trust and a mediator
is to reinvent the banking industry.
i. Loans and credits
Banks help with payments, loans, and credits. However, traditional lenders are subscribed to loans based on an inaccurate and
unsecured credit reporting system.
When completing a bank loan application, banks must assess the risk that the loans will not be returned. They do this by having
complex factors such as credit ratings, the proportion of debt and income and the ownership of properties. To obtain this
information, they access clients’ credit report provided by one of the three leading credit agencies which are Experian, TransUnion,
and Equifax. By using these data, banks can then evaluate the risk of defaults and interests on the loans.
zeosX solution:
By erasing the need for middlemen or intermediaries in the loan and credit industry, we aim to make it more secure to borrow
money and provide lower interest rates using zeosX loan.
With the zeosX loan, we offer clients with either collateral or non-collateral loan. The collateral loan allows users to get dollars fast
without selling any of their crypto-assets. The non-collateral loan also rewards users with ZeoPoints for early repayment.
Users can easily access zeosX loans without going through any rigorous or cumbersome process.
ii. Centralized banking system
It is safe to say the centralized banking system has been failing because most of its core operations are manipulated by the “greedy
and powerful” people within the sector. This has led to corruption in the traditional banks and system and gradually, the fiat
currency system will fail. Transparency in this banking system is far-fetched as clients have no insight to what their money is used
for as they have no control of it. Thus, the monies kept by clients, which have little or no interest at all, in these banks are used by
the corrupt people to enrich themselves.

Will you get your cash IN A FINANCIAL CRISIS?
When a large number of people withdraw their money from the banks, how much cash do you think is in their reserve? If a bank
run is to occur, will you get back your money? The number below might shock you!
JPMorgan Chase Deposits: $1,375,179,000,000
Assiniboine CU Cash on Hand: $23,873,000,000
JPMorgan Chase Cash To Deposit Ratio: 98.26% of Deposits not covered
Wells Fargo Deposits: $1,306,079,000,000
Wells Fargo Cash on Hand: $20,729,000,000
Cash To Deposit Ratio: 98.41% of Deposits not covered
Goldman Sachs Deposits: $728,919,000,000
Goldman Sachs on Hand: $9,070,000,000
Cash To Deposit Ratio: 98.76% of Deposits not covered
Citibank Deposits: $698,175,000,000
Citibank Cash on Hand: $28,701,000,000
Cash To Deposit Ratio: 95.89% of Deposits not covered
Barclays Deposits: £455,339,000,000
Barclays Cash on Hand: £49,711,000,000
Cash To Deposit Ratio: 89.08% of Deposits not covered
Generally, we do know that the banks make money on the interest they charge on loans because that interest is higher than the
interest they pay on depositors’ accounts. The amount available to lend also depends upon the reserve requirement the Federal
Reserve Board has set.
The question to ask is, without any transparent and immutable public ledger, do we really know what they do with our money? 
 12
Weak Link in the centralized banking system banking system
The centralized banking operations are all tied to a single powerful mainframe and database system and this has invited major
hacking attempts on the banks themselves.
Successful hacking attempts:
The national bank of Bangladesh was hit in a highly sophisticated hacking attack, with the attackers taking off with $81 Million
(£58 Million) and attempting to steal as much as $1 Billion (£710 Million).
“The same group has also attacked banks in Ecuador, Vietnam, and Philippines”, according to investigators.
Hackers are getting more ambitious, spending longer on attacks and demonstrating greater sophistication, experts told Business
Insider — and the rewards they are reaping are larger than ever.
zeosX solution:
We intend to solve the crisis mentioned above faced by the traditional banks by introducing our own zeosX crypto bank.
With the use of an underlying blockchain ledger which is immutable, we would create and offer a decentralized banking system
which is fully transparent, giving individuals full access and control to their funds as they can quickly determine how their funds
are spent and get the relevant interest on the usage of their funds. With the invention of zeosX crypto bank, we will eliminate
corruption as it is impossible for any single entity to manipulate our public ledgers due to its immutability.
There is no single mainframe or database system in our zeosX crypto bank, and this will completely cushion any hacking attempt
launched at this revolutionary banking system. In the case where traditional banks still make use of a database which is vulnerable
to hacking attacks, zeosX will use decentralized applications (DApps) which will further strengthen our platform security. Our
DApps are also designed to be highly efficient while being user-friendly by either the older or younger generations.
III. Fees and charges
In this section, we aim to cover the problems faced by the traditional banks and third-party payment gateways when it comes to
the exorbitant fees and charges for every transaction carried out.
PayPal
PayPal charges a 2.9% fee from the total amount of payment received and a flat fee of $0.3 on each transaction carried out. In
some countries where debit cards are not allowed for online transactions worldwide, users who do not have credit cards have
resorted to asking PayPal third-party providers to top up for them.
These same users have complained of being billed a fee as high as $50 just for a small amount of only $1000 to top up PayPal
because of the foreign exchange rates and at the same time, being charged as high as almost 5% to make transfers from one user
to another. These exorbitant fees are uncalled for and just serve as a way to rob off individuals.
Users who want to withdraw money out of PayPal also have to wait for at least 3 to 5 business days for the funds to appear in
their bank accounts.
Credit Cards
The charges paid by credit card users are really high and this has been a thorn in the flesh for them. We will list out some of the
fees being paid by users.
1. Annual Fees: These fees are paid annually and based on our research, it ranges from $19 to as high as $500 depending on
the credit card issuer.
2. Balance Transfer Fees: These fees are paid whenever user transfer balance from one credit card to another which are usually
3% of the amount transferred.
3. Cash Advance Fees: These fees are paid whenever users withdraw money out of ATM using their credit cards or for cash
equivalent transactions. Charges are usually 5% of the cash amount.
 13
4. Expedited Payment Fees: These fees are charged when there are last-minute payments needed to be made by credit card
users through the phone to avoid being late. These fees are around $10 - $15.
5. Foreign Transaction Fees: Foreign transaction fees are charged when you make a purchase in a foreign currency in addition
to the conversion fee. They are usually 3% of the transaction amount.
6. Late Fees: Late fees are paid for failing to meet up the minimum credit card payment when due. These charges can be up to
$38.
7. Returned Check Fees: Returned payment fees are charged when your bank returns your credit card payment. As a penalty,
fees are as high as $35. They are charged every time a payment is returned.
Having outlined some of the major fees paid by credit card users, we can completely see the need to eliminate this card payment
system as some of the fees listed above are just put in place to extort clients and credit card users.
Intermediaries such as visa and MasterCard also charge merchants with extremely high interchange reimbursement and surcharge
fees which are unnecessary. There are also rules and regulations that merchants have to follow in order to partner with these
third-party payment processors.
zeosX solution:
We will highlight how the features of zeosX banking components would solve these problems associated with unreasonable fees.
Our next generation of payment gateway, ZeoPay, is a decentralized payment system suitable for online transactions. Entrepreneurs
can also integrate ZeoPay to take their businesses to the next level. With ZeoPay, not only users can pay with stable coins, but we
also promise low and transparent fees. This is beneficial for freelancing platforms because they can reduce enormous service fees
too.
Users do not need to pay heavy fees to transfer crypto from one account to another. They can instantly convert their crypto assets
to fiat and vice versa. We also offer swift and priority cash withdrawal to other payment accounts whom we have partnerships
with.
With our own zeosX Point Of Service (POS) devices and ZeoPay, we will use blockchain to reduce fees to its barest minimum,
there would be no need for currency conversion fees as countries with little or no availability of USD can easily transact across
borders and even spend their earnings without necessarily converting to USD and transaction fees will be very minimal.
iv. Insurance
The major problem with insurance in traditional banking is ingenuity and fraud within the system, not to mention that you have
to queue long hours and dial countless phone calls to get your desired insurance manually.
zeosX solution:
Our remarkable ZeoInsure will solve all the above problems. Not only clients will be exposed to a whole new level of insurance in
crypto, but we also aim to offer them a seamless and transparent insurance system where they can gain access to different types
of insurance for life, accident, etc.

3 MARKET ANALYSIS
A thorough market analysis was carried out for the following markets:
• Financial Markets
• Crowdfunding
• Initial Coin Offering
• Growth Of The Cryptocurrency Markets
Financial Markets
The cryptocurrency market has grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing in value and volume. The
primary encryption value is Bitcoin, however, other cryptocurrencies are also using blockchain technology recently. The current
market value of Bitcoin alone is estimated at $19.5 Billion, which is still at infancy compared to other markets.
The total market capitalization of the world is $80 Trillion and is growing rapidly. The value of the stock market worldwide has
increased by 320% since 2009, with the US stocks dominating the global stock markets. However, the dot-com crash and the
2008 financial crisis have severely affected the number of Americans investing in the stock market. As a result, the percentage of
American investors continue to decrease from 65.5% in 2007 to only 52% in 2016. Currently, the 24/7 forex market is the largest
financial market in the world, both in value and volume, with the US dollar being the most traded currency in the forex market,
making up close to 85 percent of all trades.
As more people recognize the potential of the blockchain, cryptocurrency will only continue to thrive and will achieve a bigger
market capitalization.
Crowdfunding
The use of traditional crowdfunding as a method of raising capital has some advantages: Small or medium companies can collect
the necessary capital without going through the tedious process of taking a bank loan. It also allows you to obtain feedback from
the crowd.
One of the main disadvantages of this approach is the effort and time required. The largest amount of money raised through
crowdfunding is in China. It is expected that the number of collective financing campaigns and the value of their transactions will
continue to increase by 2022. 

15
Initial Coin Offering
According to reports published by Fabric Ventures and TokenData, Initial Coin Offering (ICO) raised $5.6 Billion last year. In 2017,
a growing number of companies are issuing their own digital currency as a means of raising capital. The ICO market attracts legal
attention due to the amount of money it has raised. Both reports found that out of the 913 ICOs created, there are 435 successful
ones, which means that 48% succeeded.
The average amount raised was $12.7 Million, with 3/4 of the funds going into block infrastructure projects. Most of the people
who invest in these ICOs projects are retail investors, and institutions are increasingly looking to invest in ICOs.
“On average, tokens have returned 12.8x the initial investment against the dollar compared to 7.7x for ETH and 4.9x for BTC
during 2017”, the reports said.
The total amount of funds raised through ICOs are close to $4 Billion, which is twice as much as venture capital investments. Most
ICOs use the Ethereum platform, with popular wallet MyEtherWallet (MEW) recording more attempted attacks than Fortune 500
banks.
The total amount raised through ICOs to date is over 9,783,634,561 USD.
Growth Of The Cryptocurrency Markets
As of 21st March 2018, there are currently 1,568 different cryptocurrencies (654 tokens and 914 coins) available. The first one,
Bitcoin, was launched on January 9th, 2009 and various coins were created after that. From December 2013 to the end of 2017,
the number of cryptocurrencies increased from 40 to 1,273 which is a 3083% increase.
The number of cryptocurrencies and exchange platforms are also increasing each year. There are 190 exchanges currently,
compared to just 70 exchanges three years ago. By 15 March 2015, trading volume has increased tremendously as the number
of cryptocurrencies and trading platforms continue to grow.
The number of transactions in the blockchain has also dramatically increased. Bitcoin took only 2 years to make a visible appearance
on the charts in 2011, hitting 13,900 transactions on June 14 that same year, according to BitInfoCharts. Since then, transactions
had been declining until May 2012 when it officially began its upward trajectory.
On August 8th, 2015, Ethereum was introduced into the cryptocurrency market, recording 2,881 transactions and had been
growing in popularity ever since. June 12th, 2017 saw Ethereum overtook Bitcoin in terms of total transactions made in one day,
with a record of 292,941, compared to Bitcoin’s 268,951 transactions. Bitcoin had not re-claimed the transactional throne ever
since, however, it still dominated its market capitalization and total volume traded per day. On December 14th, 2017, Bitcoin hit
its peak, with 490,459 transactions recorded on the blockchain. Ethereum’s peak came soon after, on January 4th, 2018, with a
total of whopping 1.35 Million transactions recorded.
 16
Q1 2018 saw the decline in transactions for both cryptocurrencies, on March 20th, 2018, Ethereum recorded a total of 661,791
transactions. Despite dropping since its all-time high, this is still an increase of 22,870.9% compared to its first appearance on
August 2015. Similarly, Bitcoin clocked in 195,041 on the same date, which was an increase of 1,303.2% since June 2011.
Despite the current drop in transactions for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the cumulative total of all blockchain transactions have
been on the rise with no signs of slowing down. As of March 19th, 2018, there were over 305.61 Million transactions recorded
in a single day, according to Blockchain.info. This was an increase of 48.27% when compared to the 206.12 Million transactions
that occurred a year ago on March 18th, 2017.
3.1 Market Potential
It takes a lot more than creating a cryptocurrency to revolutionize and disrupt the traditional banking sector completely. zeosX is
employing a unique approach to transform the financial space using the potency of the blockchain technology and the unique
features of our ecosystem to completely utilize every potential available in the $1 Trillion combined financial and cryptocurrency
global market.
We have carefully analyzed the market opportunities available to zeosX under the following markets in the financial and
cryptocurrency industry.
1. ICOs:
• Tokens using Ethereum platform raised over $18 Million over the course of a month
• Funds raised in 2017 alone: $6,073,707,934
• The first three months of 2018: 32 ICOs raised $2,710,641,542
2. Cryptocurrency:
• 12,000 crypto transactions per hour
• 99,000 Bitcoins sent every 60 minutes
• Predictions for the global crypto market in 2018: over $700 Billion
3. Crowdfunding:
• The total amount of crowdfunding volume worldwide: $16.2 Billion
• Launched projects on Kickstarter in 2018 alone: 385,335
• Amount of funds raised worldwide: $34 Billion

17
3.2 Competitive Advantage
zeosX to traditional banks
zeosX to payment processors
As mentioned in the problem analysis section, not only Visa and Mastercard charge merchants with unnecessary costly fees, they
often have breakdown problems. As a result, The zeosX Cards will not partner with any payment processors and will operate on
zeosX POS devices which are powered by ultra high lighting speed zeosX Core.
Furthermore, most of Visa and Mastercard cards users have applied online can’t be delivered to certain countries because they
are subjected to irrelevant regulations imposed by payment processors. Thus, our Core will enable The zeosX Cards to be distributed
to investors worldwide.
zeosX to payment gateways
Our ZeoPay is the next evolution of decentralized payment gateway that enables customers to shop online without any hassle.
Merchants are also not subjected to any hidden fees.
 18
4 Core Technology
Our 4 banking components are powered by zeosX Core. It is a unique innovative technology that offers unprecedented performance.
zeosX Core consists of Blockchain, smart contract, and DApps which forms an essential part of the whole platform. Besides zeosX
Core, every software in each of the components has also been thoughtfully implemented using the latest robust technological
system.
4.1 Smart Contracts
zeosX Core will not function without the smart contracts. One of the main reasons we build our Core around smart contracts is
because of the accuracy, security, and transparency they provide. zeosX uses countless confidential data to carry out transactions,
and there will be many problems if we are to use the traditional way of storing data. Using smart contracts not only eliminate
problems such as errors, disputes, miscommunications, and manipulations, but they also provide the platform with the velocious
lighting speed it needs.
Each of the banking components is combined into the all-in-one zeosX Hub, a decentralized crypto banking system, which allows
non-collateral borrowers to receive loan fundings to even auctioning your properties!

If clients do not repay the loans, their crypto assets will automatically be unlocked and can be claimed by zeosX’s loan lenders.
Liquidation procedures will also be initiated once clients’ assets fall below the minimum LTV ratio.
Instant Notifications
Daily interest rate will also be updated instantly on zeosX platform with no delays. To maintain loan safety levels, clients will be
notified with liquidation warnings.
Real-Time Analytics
When the value of clients’ main assets appreciate in value or after they repay their loans, loan limits will automatically increase and
can be withdrawn immediately.
 26
As mentioned in the above diagram, clients can borrow in just 3 simple steps with no complicated credit checks at all. The amount
of borrowed money they get is updated on The zeosX Cards simultaneously, available to be spent or withdrawn anytime. Clients
also have the option to get their borrowed money through the zeosX marketplace.
There will be a 50% discount in interest rate and an LTV boost of 70% when clients pledged ZEOS tokens as a collateral.
 27
Non-Collateral Loan
We also offer non-collateral loan to clients living in certain countries. They can borrow cryptocurrencies with just a national
identification card.
As promised, non-collateral loan has no minimum loan repayments within a month, however, borrowers that do not repay their
loans after the end of each month will have to pay late payment fees. If they default on the loans, our debt collection agency will
take the necessary legal actions against them.
Borrowing a larger amount of cryptocurrencies will require a more detailed credit check but it will not be as complicated as the
traditional banking system. After a loan is approved, it will be posted to zeosX decentralized marketplace where investors and
lenders worldwide can invest in that loan with up to 30% lending interest rate per annum.
Loans are determined by smart contract’s grades ranging from A1 to C3 with A1 being the safest and C3 is the riskiest.

7 zeosX ICO
Why Initial Coin Offering?
This is a non-regulatory means of raising funds for a new company of cryptographic value. Start-up companies use Initial Coin
Offering (ICO) to bypass a rigorous and regulated way of raising the capital required by venture capitalists and banks.
At zeosX, we aim to offer a percentage of ZEOS tokens to our investors interested in this revolutionary project in exchange for
fiat and other cryptocurrencies. The zeosX’s (ZEOS) token sale is required to enable us to raise funds for further development of
zeosX platform to completely reinvent the traditional banking industry.
