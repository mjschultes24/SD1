Buy it Once,.. it will Pay you Twice
An Waves platform based Token, Tomahawkcoin was minted with the
intention to bridge the two worlds of trading virtual currency and the
equity ownership in Tomahawk Exploration LLC. With a solid business plan
and business model, designed to maintain and thereby increase the initial
value of the ICO.
Tomahawk Exploration LLC




  We are distinct from Paycoin and other failed promises hidden behind virtual
currencies in the past which had no business plan and highly priced from
the gate, Tomahawkcoin will be priced at $0.05, or its USD equivalency in
the currently wide and most popular used digital currency, such as
Dogecoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple.
  With a solid business plan and business model, designed to maintain and
thereby increase the initial value of the ICO.
  The Company expects more than $500,000 USD to be generated by each
well per year based on the reserve reports:
  10 wells x $500,000 = $5,000,000 a year revenue projection




  The total Tomahawkcoin number will be set at 200,000,000 coins, and our
intention is to have the coin trade on all applicable exchanges.
  The bold ICO price objective and confident time horizon goal of 18 months is based
on the legitimacy of Tomahawk Exploration LLC, an oil & gas exploration company,
managed by David Laurance and registered in Nevada with HQ in California.
  The time horizon of 18 months is fundamental to the initial ICO, whereas ICO capital
will be used to place Tomahawk Exploration LLC (The Company) into a publicly
traded company on the OTC Market and fund the cost of drilling the 10 wells
available.
  The Company will transition from private to public in approximately 10 to 18
months and drilling is expected to commence in 6 to 10 months. After the 18-month
holding period, all ICO owners of Tomahawkcoin are eligible to
exchange Tomahawkcoin for the equivalent value in share(s) of the
public Company priced at the close of market on the day of conversion.




  The estimated price of $0.05 USD price per Tomahawkcoin is based on the
IPO (Initial Public Offering) price expectation of the Company set to start
trading on the OTC Market at no less than $0.05, and 200,000,000 shares
outstanding. Due to the volatility of market conditions, known fluctuations in
capital markets, changes in economic variables, and risk inherent to the
energy sector, there is no guarantee as to price and / or timing which is
subject to change. There is no guarantee, implied, or otherwise, as far
as, the price of Tomahawkcoin is concerned on any currency traded
exchange, since the parity of which Tomahawkcoin will trade for, and
against, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin or Dogecoin, have no set price,
and no price guarantee in any way or form, due to the constant price
volatility of these coins, known to carry their own risk of losing USD value.




  Tomahawk Exploration LLC capital requirement is $5,000,000 to
commence drilling and thereto function with ease and without restriction
towards the main target of exchange listing as a public entity; therefore,
only half or 50%, 100,000,000 Tomahawkcoins will be sold to potential
investors, as the other half will be used for marketing, advertising, and the
creation of better liquidity on the coin traded exchange and percentage
ownership of the Board of Directors and employees’ salaries that will work
with the company towards our goal of creating value for our
stakeholders and future shareholders in Tomahawk Exploration LLC or
the Company.




  There are no conversion requirements; however, those that choose
not to exchange their Tomahawkcoins after 18 months into shares of
the Company, may continue trading their Tomahawkcoins freely, as
they do not expire. Whereas, they have the option to make their
exchange at a later date, days and / or even years later.

One Tomahawkcoin is equal to one publicly free traded share of
Tomahawk Exploration LLC upon conversion.




  The business plan provided by the Company is believed to increase the
demand for Tomahawkcoin on digital currency exchange markets, such
as Bittrex, Poloniex, and others. Pre-IPO ownership is exclusively
available and may only be obtained prior to the public registration of
the Company through Tomahawkcoin purchase and no other way. Coin
and share equivalency: Additional Tomahawkcoins into the market may
be exchanged for additional shares of the publicly traded Company.




  We have made sure that our team and Board of Directors are refined successful
citizens with flawless backgrounds, verifiable credentials, heroes, public activists,
and skilled individuals with great experience in both business and digital currency.
We sincerely hope that our solid business proposal and community established
trust will make this venture great and a complete success that will lead to future
projects and profitable prospects.
