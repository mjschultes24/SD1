The Current & Growing Issue
Crypto Currency exchanges in the current day
and age have moved a long way from their
original structure at the beginning phases of
crypto   currency.   What   used   to   be   a
semi-anonymous  and  seamless  process  to
trade  between  one  crypto  currency  and
another has become a heavily regulated and
di  cult process for users all over the world,
arguably   caused   by   adoption   of   crypto
currency majorly by centralized institutions.
The adoption by centralized institutions has
forced  exchanges  to  adopt  the  current  fiat
monetary structure that we most use in our
day to day lives into crypto currency. Adopting
this system which arguably discourages some
of the core foundations of Satoshi’s vision, the
freedom of money & anonymity.
Over time this current direction of the crypto
currency exchanges and platforms, has made
the revival the core values of crypto currency,
along   with   the   ability   to   transact   and
exchange crypto currency without a regulatory
party, a little less possible almost impossible.

VeloxCoin [VLX]
Overview
VeloxCoin is a Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake (POW/POS) hybrid which comprises the digital aspect of the
Velox Project. Each quarter, a percentage of profit accumulated from revenue generated by the utilities
and services offered by the Velox Project, will be used towards VeloxCoin [VLX] “buy-¬backs”, performed
on-exchange by the team, this will reduce the overall circulating supply of VeloxCoin [VLX] in the market
and strengthen the VeloxCoin [VLX] community as well as the marketplace overall. VeloxCoin [VLX] is
the only aspect of the Velox Project externally tradable, the rest of the Velox Project utilities and services
will reside exclusively on the VeloxCoin [VLX] platform. All other Velox-associated currencies are not

VeloxCoin [VLX] Exchange
Overview
The VLX Exchange will provide a temporary, yet instant & safe way, to exchange VeloxCoin [VLX] with a
number of pairs upon the launch of the Velox Project. This is to reach the initial 0.5% VLX distribution, to
instantly offer a means of exchange for VeloxCoin [VLX] holders and to create an operational real-world
environment for the future open-source version of the platform.
The Velox Project has transformed the outdated & centralized WLOX open-source platform into a simple
yet secure, fast & anonymous exclusively cryptocurrency exchange with absolutely no limitation for users
all over the globe.
Infrastructure
The VLX Exchange is developed on the basis of the WLOX project codebase, an abandoned fiat/crypto
open source exchange project created by Crypto Capital in 2014. The original source code has been
stripped  down,  adjusted  and  re-developed  by  the  Velox  Development  Team  into  an  exclusively
cryptocurrency  exchange  with  the  most  up-to-date  security  mechanisms  &  protocols,  a  new  fully
anonymous user structure and an effective yet simple trading engine for VLX pairs.
The VLX Exchange consists of a complete security & backend upgrade from the WLOX code to maximize
user security, incorporating the most up-to-date security standards, measures and protocols. All FIAT
and banking related features have been completely removed from the VLX Exchange Platform.
The VLX Exchange has a dual purpose, initially it will act as a fully functional exchange during the first
phase of launch, and once the VeloxBolt Platform is launched, it (VLX Exchange) will then become an
open-source exchange project to allow new exchange platform owners access to a new, secure &
revamped codebase as opposed to the outdated and abandoned WLOX project. This transition is further
explained in “Future/Post-Transition Use”.

VeloxBolt Transition
The transition from the VLX Exchange to VeloxBolt will be seamless and require little to no effort on the
client end. Users of the VLX Exchange will automatically have their accounts migrated to the VeloxBolt
platform on community-beta release prior to complete commencement.
VLX Exchange users will be given two clear reminders prior to the transition one week and one day before
the  transition  respectively.  These  reminders  will  be  broadcasted  via  all  Velox  social  and  direct
communication channels including:
Email to VLX Exchange provided email (if any & if opted in)
Forum Boards: BitcoinTalk, BitcoinGarden
Social Media: Twitter, Facebook, Medium
Communication Channels: Telegram, Discord, Slack
All channels will be notified to ensure all users are aware of the upcoming transition.
During this one-week period, users will be requested to complete the following:
Backup any trades they wish to keep on record, though this information will be available on request in .csv format
for some time after the transition.
Withdraw any balances if they would not like their balance transferred to the VeloxBolt platform
Ensure their account information is correct and written down so that they can login without issue into the
VeloxBolt platform after the transition is complete.
All VLX Exchange users will still be able to trade, deposit and withdraw up until the transition commences.
There will be a set time and countdown offered closer to the date.
Once the transition period has ended, all exchange functions will be deactivated on the Velox Exchange and
all users, accounts and balances will be migrated across to the VeloxBolt platform. After confirmation from
the development and security team that the migration has been successfully completed, users will be able
login into the VeloxBolt platform with the same login information that they used for the VLX exchange. All
users will then have full access to their accounts and admin functionality.
Once  the  transition  has  been  completed,  The  VLX  Exchange  domain  will  redirect  to  the  VeloxBolt
platform where a notice will be presented for users who were not aware of the transition notifying that their
VLX Exchange credentials will still be accessible and trade history upon request, along with detailed
information regarding the overall transition process that took place.
During the transition process all VLX Exchange functions will be disabled. The transition is expected to be
completed in approx. 3 hours, however to ensure the transition takes place in the smoothest and most
secure fashion possible, this expected time frame may be subject to slight delay.
Future/Post-Transition Use
The Velox Project will continually strive to strengthen the support for the decentralization & anonymity
movement by offering utilities and services that do not require personal information to access and have very
minimum central control. The WLOX Open-Source Exchange codebase, being the base coding of the VLX
Exchange,  was  built  and  designed  in  2014  by  Crypto  Capital  as  a  centralized  &  institutional  based
infrastructure for FIAT to Crypto  (and vice versa) use. As aforementioned, all FIAT and banking related
features were stripped away in the creation of the VLX Exchange code and customized to create a modern,
cryptocurrency exclusive exchange platform.
The ultimate goal of making the VLX Exchange platform open-source, is to offer a modern cryptocurrency
exchange codebase that will constantly be updated by an interested and vested community while being
fully supported and semi-managed by the Velox Project Developers. The intent is to frequently update the
source code with up-to-date security & functionality updates, to facilitate future new exchanges to benefit
from the security and stability improvements of the infrastructure to ensure these new exchanges have
minimal risk of exploitation and hacking.
After the complete transition of the VLX Exchange into the VeloxBolt platform, the Velox Development
Team will prepare the VLX Exchange platform codebase for complete open source access to the whole
community, with the Velox source code project available on Github. This will allow users, developers and
potential/existing exchange owners to freely interact and improve the platform, solve issues and easily build
new functionalities using a stable resource that has been tested extensively and operated in a real time
user-based environment, and worked on recently in modern conditions.

VeloxBolt Exchange
Overview
The  VeloxBolt  Anonymous  Cryptocurrency
Exchange is one of the two vital components
to  achieve  the  Velox  Project  vision.  The
platform   is   a   completely   anonymous
exchange  open  to  users  worldwide  and  is
planned  to  be  one  of  the  most  secure,
responsive    and    advanced    anonymous
exchanges in operation. VeloxBolt will offer
industry-grade  trading  facilities  that  will
allow users to exchange hundreds of crypto
currency pairs instantly with no limitations
on  trading,  withdrawal,  or  deposits  and
absolute privacy with no private or personal
information  required  to  use  the  exchange,
made possible by ZeroNet technology.
The  VeloxBolt  platform  will  launch  as  a
completely    anonymous    cryptocurrency
exchange                                                                            with                                                                           planned   future
developments  to  introduce  decentralized
exchange  facilities  for  Bitcoin,  Ethereum
(and others based on demand) pairs as well
as instant swap services.
Revenue Model
The VeloxBolt Exchange will generate revenue from the following avenues:
Revenue Stream                                                                      Description

Regulation & Takedowns
The VeloxBolt platform has addressed the possibility of
regulation and takedowns to prevent the possibility of
downtime  by  utilizing  an  upgraded  and  updated
version of the open-source ZeroNet technology to allow
the platform to be served all over the world anonymous-
ly and securely. By using ZeroNet technology to serve
the VeloxBolt platform web interface, users who access
the platform act as peers to strengthen the privacy and
accessibility for both other users and their own environ-
ments. The Velox Development Team will continuously
refine and upgrade the ZeroNet protocols in prepara-
tion for the VeloxBolt platform release to ensure the
highest  level  of  privacy,  anonymity  and  security  is
offered when accessing the platform and its features.
To learn more about ZeroNet technology, please visit
the ZeroNet website.
With this being stated, The VeloxBolt platform will take
on board requests to limit certain countries from access
and is willing to adjust the way the platform operates
for these specific countries if su  cient cause to do so is
provided. The VeloxBolt platform, however, will not seize
operation  for  certain  regions  if  there  is  no  su  cient
reasoning and evidence to do so.
Theft & Hacks
Financial Theft
Similarly, to the point above regarding Takedowns, the cryptocurrencies stored by the platform will be
hosted o   ine with a partial reserve spread across multiple locked down servers which will act as the
hot-wallet for the platform. The VeloxBolt platform has security mechanisms pre-tested in the VeloxCoin
[VLX] Exchange period which will be fully implemented on the VeloxBolt platform.
The  cold-storage  facilities  are  manned  by  our  founding  team  and  use  extremely  secure
multi-signature technology. Multi-Signature wallets only permit the transfer of cryptocurrency with
signatures from at least 3 of our higher-authority board members. Even if hackers were able to access
the cold-storage facilities or breach a team members wallet/working environment, transactions will not

Client Data Theft
In  2016,  over  4.2billion  cases  of  user-data  theft  by  cybercriminals  were  recorded,  as  reported  by
RiskBasedSecurity.com in January 2017. The solution to this rapidly growing figure is simple, eliminate
unnecessary storage or requirement for sensitive user information for web-based services that can be
targeted by hackers.
VeloxBolt solves this issue by never allowing personal user data to be submitted to our platform,
eliminating the need for users to submit their private or sensitive information to use the platform. This
critical feature of VeloxBolt virtually eliminates the threat of hacking because there is nothing for the
hackers to gain by hacking the system. No user specific personal data will be stored on the VeloxBolt
Platform now or in the future.
Usernames are pre-generated when registering to the VeloxBolt platform to enhance anonymity and
eliminate security issues potentially caused on the client end, therefor if this information were to be
intercepted by hackers, it would be unique only to the VeloxBolt platform and not effect client logins on
other services.
Passwords are permanently hashed and can never be decoded by hackers if the database were to be
intercepted,  and  as  aforementioned  above,  would  be  worthless  with  a  pre-generated  username
unrelated to services outside of the VeloxBolt platform.

Performance
The VeloxBolt platform utilizes state-of-the-art server technology to ensure the uptime and stability of
the platform at all times. This is achieved through using the peer-to-peer ZeroNet protocol to serve as
the VeloxBolt platform rather than using a singular, centralized server farm that would be subject to
attacks, takedowns and potential performance issues. This is explained further under “Service Attacks &
Hardware Failure”.
An increase in tra  c while utilizing the peer-to-peer ZeroNet protocol will increase the security and
stability of the entire platform, whereas limiting tra  c to one centralized server, the ZeroNet protocol
will eliminate risks of downtime, hardware failure or outage. This level of security is not possible when
using a single server to deliver content to clients, as maintenance to resolve any issues that arise would
result in client-side downtime or reduced speed of the platform.
Service Attacks & Hardware Failure
Since the VeloxBolt platform will deliver content at a faster rate and become increasingly more secure
as nodes (users) connect to the platform, it is impossible for the platform to be taken o   ine or attacked
unless all nodes are completely disconnected from the platform. The ZeroNet protocol which will be
utilized in the platform will allow VeloxBolt to remain online through the strongest of attacks and
takedown attempts, while maintaining (and improving) optimal performance and service speed in any
situation.

Velox Novum Wallet
Overview
The vNovum Wallet is a native open-source
cryptocurrency wallet that will facilitate multiple
forms of cryptocurrency exchange, including the
use of the VeloxBolt exchange services, and its
own decentralized (P2P) exchange. The wallet
does not share financial information such as
private keys with any third party or online server
and houses a wide range of security features,
making it one of the most secure solutions for
cryptocurrency storage.
The vNovum wallet will be the first wallet of its
kind to be accompanied by a completely
anonymous online exchange and will allow fully
synchronized accessibility.
Security
The Novum Wallet allows users to securely store,
send and receive cryptocurrencies by encrypting
private keys and storing them locally on the
users operating environment. This prevents
private keys from being transmitted or accessed
by third parties/servers, preventing theft of
private keys. Transactions are made by briefly
decrypting the private key to sign the
transaction before the transaction is
broadcasted over the network. Transaction data
is encrypted and only accessible by the user
locally.
Decentralized Trading
Secure storage of cryptocurrency &
decentralized in-wallet exchanges are the core
focus in the development and operation of the
vNovum wallet. The decentralized on-chain
exchange facility will utilize the VeloxBolt
platform to execute trades instantly, free of
governance and without third party regulation
or interference.
Trading using the vNovum exchange function
is instantaneous, decentralized and secure. This
is made possible by the Input Validity Protocol
(IVP).
