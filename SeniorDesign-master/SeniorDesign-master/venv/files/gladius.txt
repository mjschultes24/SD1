1.1 | The Gladius Solution
How Gladius is changing the cybersecurity landscape.
DDoS attacks are becoming an increasing reality of operating a business with an internet
presence. These attacks can cost an incredible amount of money, not just in lost uptime, but
also a loss of consumer trust and crisis PR. Last year alone DDoS attacks amounted to a $150
billion loss, while on average corporations can spend over $5000 a month on protection
from other DDoS protection services, even if they never suffer an attack. This happens while
a majority of computing power and bandwidth in the world goes unused. Gladius envisions
a future where these vast resources can be utilized to mitigate attacks. (Incapsula and
SecureList)
By leveraging the blockchain to allow communication between computers, and a pay as
you go marketplace, Gladius can facilitate the creation of the extremely fault tolerant and
inexpensive pools tailored to a client’s specific needs. Asside from just filtering traffic, these
pools will be able to accelerate content as well.
By decentralizing and removing the middleman, the whole nature of protecting a website
will change. Buisness that previously couldn’t afford adequate protection can purchase
services that perfectly fit their budget. Those paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a
service they never fully utilize can start paying for only exactly what they use - and for much
less. In addition, customers who are tired of paying for a high speed internet connection
(that is only used for a few hours a day) can finally put that connection to good use.
Gladius Network, LLC - 2017                                                                          4

1.2 | Gladius’ Mission
Our motivations, directions, and goals as a company.
Since the dawn of the internet, the technology surrounding websites has been constantly
evolving. With this new technology comes the power to enhance a business’ online
presence but also harm it. Technology is truly the greatest double edged sword, however.
Gladius’  mission is to negate the harm brought by new vulnerabilities and take advantage
of the same style of decentralized network that attackers have long used. Gladius is
concerned primarily with protection from DDoS attackers and the implementation of a high
quality CDN.
While there are many who believe DDoS protection is only needed in very few
circumstances, DDoS protection is important for any entity that has a presence on the
internet. DDoS attacks have cost millions for household names like Blizzard Entertainment,
the BBC, and GitHub. The average DDoS attack costs a company 2.5 million dollars.
Any business should want to increase their site speeds as well as their response times. A well
done CDN can do not only that but also greatly expand a site’s reach offering unparalleled
access in any corner of the globe.  The massive advantage that a CDN grants to businesses is
easily noticeable by the fact that the CDN market in 2015 was worth $4.95 billion dollars but
is expected to more than triple by 2020 to a value of $15.73 billion dollars.
The ability to greatly, if not completely, negate DDoS attacks and the ability to create an
effective and secure CDN puts the Gladius team in a unique position. The team’s goal to fully
utilize blockchain technology to fight against DDoS attacks and provide a competitive CDN
service. However, above all else, the Gladius team is constantly striving towards a highly
competitive marketplace in order to bring any consumer the best possible service. This goal
is always at the forefront of Gladius’ mission to make businesses safer and more effective.

1.3 | Primary Objectives
The primary milestones we are aiming for with our core product.
Phase I: Building an Initial Content Distribution and DDoS Protection Network
The Gladius team is aiming to create a CDN and DDoS mitigation service by using
blockchain technology, distributed mining pools and smart contracts.
This goal will be met and these technologies will be incorporated throughout
the entire course of Phase I which is made up of 3 stages (see Roadmap). Once
Phase I is complete, there will be a complete and comprehensive network that
is capable of handling several Gbs of connections per second and drastically
improving site load times. This will include multi-level protection and a private
rollout to select partnered websites.
Phase II: Develop Network to a Commercial Scale
The aim of Phase II is to finalize the network from Phase I and making it
commercially viable on a large scale. This means greatly increasing the amount of
data throughput to cope with a far greater demand. Additionally, Gladius node
pools will be greatly improved with full vetting and rating processes and smart
contracts will be expanded for discovery and identification services.
Once Phase II is complete, there will be a polished network that is ready to take
on the demands of hundreds, if not thousands, of websites. Phase II also allows
for the possibility of expanding pools. Each pool will be rated and validated
to ensure proper performance. Additional CDN features such as static content
caching will be added depending on levels of funding reached.
Gladius Network, LLC - 2017                                                         6




GLADIUS NETwork  whITEpApEr
1.4 | The Gladius Platform
How our entire system comes together.
Gladius’ goal is to create a fully decentralized, peer to peer, serverless node
network to connect bandwidth and storage pools to websites looking for
DDoS protection and expedited content delivery. Anyone with a computer can
download and run the Gladius peer client in the background to rent out their
unused bandwidth and storage space and earn Gladius Tokens (GLA). Large
pools with hundreds, if not thousands, of nodes will then be able to handle
a continuous stream of requests to validate website connections and block
malicious activity.
Client nodes can be started up on any Linux, Windows, or MacOS machine and
will automatically run in the background when you choose. Users will be part of
localized verification pools. Every website request a user validates will earn them
Gladius Tokens. In turn, users can sell these tokens back to websites to create an
economic cycle that promotes the growth of the Gladius Network.
Websites looking for protection will simply be able to create an account on
Gladius’ website, acquire Gladius Tokens, and then request services in a matter of
clicks. Once a website is part of the Gladius network, a live request graph will be
available to monitor connections, protection, and speed deltas.
The entire platform will progress in 3 steps which can be seen in Section 4. First
we have the proof of concept stage that will showcase all of the basic functions
of the network while not actually going into official production mode. Then,
after our token sale, we will have a closed production period where anyone
can download and run the client node. However, only approved websites can
purchase protection since the network and pools will still be in early growth
stages. Once the Gladius Network can support a large attack and the core tech
is improved, we will enter the next stage. The Gladius Network will then allow
anyone to purchase services from the various pools.
Gladius Network, LLC - 2017

GLADIUS NETwork  whITEpApEr
The process will be streamlined for both the clients and the requesters. People
who want to purchase web services will simply be able to create an account
with Gladius, purchase Gladius Tokens through us, choose a website they wish
to synchronize, set a base and max price for how much they are willing to spend,
and then request and monitor all connections to their website.
Nodes will easily be able to create a local account and wallet, configure the
network settings to open any necessary ports, join any pools that they are best
suited for, and start earning GLA. Users will be able to toggle when they are
renting their spare bandwidth and space in a matter of seconds. There will also be
additional configuration settings to automatically toggle the service based upon
time of day, other programs running, and even more in-depth user configurable
parameters.
1.5 | DDoS Protection Market
What is pushing the DDoS protection market forward.
It has become increasingly obvious that any business today looking to compete
requires a strong internet presence. This unfortunately creates more opportunity
for attacks and thus protection, like that offered from Gladius, is required.
Research has shown that the increased vulnerability to DDoS attacks is one of the
main forces that push the growing market for internet security solutions:
1) Growing risk of cyber attacks
As the world becomes more connected by the internet, valuable information and
services also come under greater risk of attack. DDoS attacks have become more
and more common in recent years and the stakes have greatly increased. This
increased threat results in the quick expansion of security solutions to deal with
and prevent DDoS attacks.
Gladius Network, LLC - 2017                                                          8




GLADIUS NETwork  whITEpApEr
2) Unfavorable market conditions
While the need for DDoS protection as a concept is excellent, the solutions
available are not. DDoS protection is often very expensive and has varying
degrees of success. The lack of a reliable and cheap solution creates a need for
new players in the DDoS protection business.
3) Government interest
Numerous attacks to private industries and government databases in past years
has brought more attention to defending government information. This has
increased the demand for proper protection from DDoS attacks.
DDoS attacks are unfortunately becoming increasingly common and are en route
to becoming an expected occurrence for any company on the internet.
According to Nexusguard’s Q1 2017 “Threat Report”, DDoS attack frequency has
increased by a staggering 380 percent in the first quarter of 2017. Nexusguard is
currently a huge player in the business of DDoS mitigation and thus their word is
not to be taken lightly.
Nexusguard comes to the conclusion in its most recent threat report that DDoS
attacks are unpredictable. Additionally the “Internet of Things” has created many
openings for potential attackers to abuse, these new and exploitable devices can
easily give valuable information and create new targets for attacks from hackers.
This new level of threat is evident in one of the largest DDoS attacks in history,
this attack took place on October 21st, 2016 and managed to affect a myriad of
services. These services, like Airbnb and Amazon, were crippled and effectively
brought to their knees by this attack. Some may view this attack as an extremely
well coordinated and a difficult maneuver to pull off.

However, according to Forbes, a single “angry gamer” was to blame for such
a devastating blow to numerous companies. The fact that a single person can
bring down corporate giants is an extremely worrisome concept and must be
addressed.
In response to this attack, the United States department of Homeland Security
has taken measures to prevent future DDoS attacks. However, even Homeland
Security admits in their article, Snapshot: Turning Back DDoS Attacks, “CSD’s
DDoSD project is beginning to tilt the playing field toward defenders. Much
work still needs to be completed, especially in the area of developing proactive
defenses against new types of attacks. Cyberspace is always changing, and the
work to prevent DDoS attacks and other threats from malicious actors will never
stop.”
With all of this information in mind, it is evident to any observer that there is
much work to be done in the field of DDoS protection. It is the hope of the
Gladius team that our product can address the needs of an ever changing
internet landscape and meet the requirements set forth by these market driving
forces.
1.6 | Content Delivery Market
What is pushing the CDN market forward.
The value of CDN services is apparent to any latent observer purely based on the
extremely fast growth of the industry as well as the widespread use, and success,
of such services. With more and more options to choose from in the CDN market,
it is the role of Gladius to offer superior and unparalleled service at a cutthroat
rate.
Research points to one of the main forces for growth in the CDN industry is the
need for speed from users on all platforms:
Gladius Network, LLC - 2017                                                           10




GLADIUS NETwork  whITEpApEr
1) User demand
Today, users demand higher quality connections to sites and in addition, there
are significantly more devices connected to the internet than ever before. In
2017, 8.4 billion devices will be in use. This demand requires more means to
deliver content quickly and effectively.
2) Raising the bar
While a CDN used to be something that is optional or perhaps something that
businesses would use to “go the extra mile”, CDN’s have become an expected
feature of nearly every major site. Today, there are 14,620,983 live websites using
a CDN. A CDN is no longer optional, it is an expectation of the consumer.
3)  Monetary implications
A CDN provides signifigant improvments in speed, and in an age where the
consumer expects instantaneous responses it is vital to appease the consumer in
this regard. This appeasement is not only beneficial so the consumer is pleased,
but more importantly, so the consumer actually consumes what is available.
In fact, this need for information quickly is so pronounced that over half of
consumers will leave a retail or e-commerce site if it’s slow.
CDN’s are an exciting new way to greatly increase the speed of information.
The speed at which information travels around our interconnected globe is
the greatest factor in determining the growth of businesses everywhere and
CDN services, like those offered by Gladius, are at the forefront of connecting
consumers to businesses and consumers to consumers everywhere.
According to Dyn’s Global Consumer Online Shopping Expectations 2015 report,
2015 saw sales figures upwards to $1.592 trillion, this e-commerce accounted for
6.7% of retail sales globally. These figures are only going to grow as e-commerce
continues to show its numerous benefits over physical sales.
Gladius Network, LLC - 2017

GLADIUS NETwork  whITEpApEr
It is only logical to improve the quality of CDN’s since it is obvious that
e-commerce will continue to grow, and with it, the need for effective CDN
services.
Dyn comes to the conclusion in their report that a major barrier keeping even
more people from shopping online is the fear of insecure sites as well as slow
speeds. Long loading times on sites makes the site seem untrustworthy to
most consumers and insecure. Having an established CDN makes sites seem
significantly more trustworthy and safe. This impression of trustworthiness and
security is not lost with the consumer and is will increase the likelihood of a
purchase from the consumer, as is evident by Dyn’s findings.
Dyn also finds, in page 6 of their 2015 report, that “over 60% of consumers plan to
make an upcoming purchase from their mobile device”. If any device at all in the
arsenal of the modern consumer is expected to be fast, it is the mobile device.
The mobile device is the epitome of the inherent consumer need for things to
be quick. Everything about a mobile device is designed to be fast, its design,
interface, layout and now it is only reasonable for the sites on a mobile device,
like any device, to be as fast as possible for the average consumer.
However, the most compelling argument for a CDN has little to do with
consumers preferring speed. In fact, there are presumably few that would “prefer”
the speed that a CDN has to offer. Instead, consumers require the speed of a CDN,
they require the immediacy of intimacy to their information. They require the
next page to load to search for what’s next and what to click on. They require the
prompt just around the corner, just around the loading screen to see the great
yellow button that almost seems to command them to buy. Everything about a
mobile device is designed to be fast with its layout and its interface. It is therefore
reasonable to assume that all sites need to make their websites as fast as possible
for the average consumer.
The human attention span is eight seconds. Just eight seconds. It is these
seconds that must be utilized to the fullest and not ignored.
Gladius Network, LLC - 2017                                                               12

For it is these eight seconds that bring them to rubble. It is these eight seconds
that bring them to their kness. It is these eight seconds, which if taken advantage
of, can build corporate empires, or if ignored, leave them in the wind.
A CDN is more than just a way to speed up a business’s site, this speed is the very
lifeblood of nearly all e-commerce transactions, it is the foundation and pinnacle,
it is alpha and omega. More importantly, as the ecommerce market grows, the
demand that a company has a good CDN to compete and satisfy consumers with
consistency, effectiveness and efficiency, will dramaticly increase

2.1 | Token System
The role of tokens in the Gladius Network Ecosystem
For our platform we will be releasing the Gladius Token, or GLA. A fixed supply
of tokens will be issued during the Token Creation and no more tokens will ever
be created. The tokens will immediatly be available to be used on our network
system we are launching prior to the public sale.
GLA will be a key component to the Gladius Network in that the token will be
used by websites to buy DDoS protection and CDN services. The majority of the
fees will go to the node owner (the individual renting out their spare bandwidth
and storage space) with a small portion going back to protocol development and
support. All fees will be denominated in GLA, which is subject to change based
on supply and demand.
The previously mentioned node owners who are part of protection pools will
essentially act as miners and be incentivized with GLA for their network support.
Owners will be paid for their individual work in these official mining pools. As
opposed to typical blockchains, mining will be rewarded for sharing bandwidth
and storage space rather than computing power (proof of work), and ownership
of the currency (proof of stake).
The token is designed so that it will likely reflect the growth of the Gladius
Network. Additionally Gladius will look into commissions for node owners in
currencies other than GLA.
Max Sale Issuance: 34,000,000 GLA
Max Token Issuance: 48,200,000 GLA
Max Token Market Cap: $12,500,000
Max Market Cap: $20,500,000

4.1 | Competitive Analysis
Our differentiation with the competition.
On October 21st 2016 Dyn, a company that controls an enormous part of the
internet’s DNS infrastructure, was hit by largest DDoS attack the world had ever
seen. Over 1.2 Tb/s of malicious connections brought down this cornerstone of
the internet. Sites including Twitter, Netflix, Reddit, CNN were all completly shut
down for an entire day. Billions of  dollars were lost because of that attack.  (The
Guardian)
Moreover, it is becoming cheaper to actually launch DDoS attacks. For as low
as $5, anyone can purchase access to a botnet and start causing mayhem. For
$400 you can practically take down any site- even ones protected by industry
standards such as Cloudflare. This entire network for rent is capable of hitting
sites with 125 Gbps.  This means that the actual cost of an organized DDoS
attacks “using a botnet of 1000 workstations can amount to $7 per hour.” (Security
Affairs)
Cloudflare has a market cap over $3.2 billion. Imperva/Incpsula’s cap is over $1.5
billion. Akamai’s is over $11 billion. Every one of these DDoS protection industry
standards charge websites an absurd amount of money for protection that may
or may not even be needed. Cloudflare’s lowest enterprise tier starts at $5000/
month, but the actual prices charged to each client is larger than this depending
on the size of the website. (Cloudflare)

GLADIUS NETwork  whITEpApEr
Gladius takes the middleman out of the picture by decentralizing the entire
network. Our pay-as-you-go service enables websites to custom tailor protection
to their exact specifications also. If you don’t get DDoS’d you don’t have to
pay as much. It’s that simple. Our marketplace of protection pools means that
individuals will compete to provide protection at the lowest price possible. So as
the platform matures the price per Gb will be on a continuous downward trend.
In the past Cloudflare has been put under backbreaking loads. These attacks
have left rippling effects for all websites under Cloudflare’s guard. Cloudflare is
centralized. There’s no going around that for them. This means there is a single
point of failure in their network. If an attacker can take down their main servers,
all the underlying websites fall to pieces also.
The Gladius network is designed so that this will never happen. Websites will be
under the protection of thousands of different pools. An attacker would have to
hit every single pool to have the same effect as DDoSing Cloudflare. Never before
has DDoS protection been done this way using a blockchain facilitator.
4.2 | Funding Breakdown
The specifics of where all money will go.
Funds from our token sale will help the development of the Gladius Network.
The following is a tentative breakdown of how we are planning to use funds for
development.
Core Development | 40%
The largest portion of funds will go to completing the development of the
Gladius Network as described in this paper. This includes the Gladius node
network, intelligent DDoS protection, smart node pools, smart contract systems,
supporting protocols and systems, end user applications, etc.
Gladius Network, LLC - 2017

GLADIUS NETwork  whITEpApEr
Security | 20%
The next major portion of the funds will be going towards developing extremely
tight security for our network. In specific this will be encapsulate encryption
between nodes, DNS obfuscations, and more.
Operations | 20%
This covers the day-to-day costs incurred for a functional system. This includes
hosting, infrastructure, staffing, outsourcing, management, and other related
expenses.
Legal | 10%
To comply with the industry’s numerous regulations, we will need legal advice
and consultation to navigate these sometimes precarious waters.
Marketing | 10%
The marketing budget will be used for strategic partnerships and directly
marketing to consumers. This will lead to a larger network with more nodes, and
more websites using the services. Overall more money will be running through
the system and going to the node owners.
4.3 | Development Roadmap
The stages of our network development.
PRE TOkEN SALE
The goal of this stage is to complete a minimum viable product to showcase the
core system architecture of the Gladius Network. We will have a functional CDN

6.1 | Gladius Architecture
The overarching technical solution.
Gladius works similarly to traditional CDN and DDoS protection companies by creating
a custom proxy which sits between a website’s server and the open internet. However,
unlike traditional networks the layer that sits between the website and the internet is
made up of small clients that split up the traffic verification and cached files/content
into thousands of tiny parts that are able to communicate with each other in fractions of
seconds.
Pools of nodes exist to group people into demographic groupings to provide a better
and faster network experience. These pools can be seen and accessed through a
marketplace where their information on geographical location, pool size, and reputation
can be viewed. Pools can additionally consist of only one individual’s or organization’s
resources, allowing them to run their own instance of a Gladius pool by not approving
outside nodes. Using our contracts, anyone can distribute their content and combat
DDoS attacks.
A critical component of any DDoS protection system is keeping the IP address of the
server hidden which the Gladius network accomplishes by having a final proxy mask the
IP from the nodes in the pool. The network will also have a built in reputation system
to prevent malicious pools. Pools also have the ability to approve individual nodes
entering the pool, allowing for a secure experience.
To create a fully functioning CDN, each node will be capable of caching key content, and
then delivering that content to nearby clients. A client will be directed to closest node to
them by using a location based DNS server, guaranteeing they will always be sent to the
nearest available node.
6.2 | Databases & Joining the Network

The database of pools will be maintained on the blockchain and appended to by
miners. This has an inherent cost associated with it, along with a fixed cost, which
incentivizes nodes to be serious as well as honest. Joining a pool is initiated
by a node with an Ethereum smart contract. The pool can deny this request
if it believes the node would not be beneficial based on the user’s general
demographic information such as location and available bandwidth and storage
space.
The database of pools will contain information about reputation, bandwidth,
maximum cache size, and location. Reputation will be based on key information
such as user reports and subsequent investigations, protection provided over
time, total pool age, and total pools size. Bandwidth will be based on the
aggregate of the nodes available bandwidth as well as the maximum bandwidth
the pool receives. Location will be viewable on a per node basis. Maximum cache
size is based on the aggregate of storage space made available by nodes. Having
all of this information allows for websites to choose pools that would be best
suited for their needs. For instance, websites could pay more for a very trusted
pool that has many nodes close to their target audience.

6.3 | Pool Manager
The key features of the load balancing, and pools.
Every pool would have a DNS service that would distribute the traffic to the
nodes for verification. Because of the nature of DNS, it is easy to distribute
the load over multiple nameservers creating a very fault tolerant system. This
coupled with the fact that these nameservers could be protected from most
attacks with firewall rules because they are only serving very simple content.
Pools would then have the ability to decide how they want to distribute their
resources to best fit the needs of their customers.
There will also be a final proxy server (or servers) run by the pool manager to
mask the true IP of the destination from any potentially malicious node.
This model allows for highly scalable and efficient traffic verification, as well as
geographically based acceleration. The protection layer of nodes is hidden from
potential bad actors with DNS, making the pool very tolerant to attack on nodes.
This architecture results in only a small point of failure to the system which is
key to a successful DDoS mitigation service. Because of the hidden nature of the
majority of the network it easy to see where an attacker would target, allowing
the pool to fortify the single point of entry.

GLADIUS NETwork  whITEpApEr
The software node client is a cross-platform desktop application that runs a
lightweight service in the background to communicate with associated pools
and verify forwarded traffic requests in real-time. Each node makes up an
integral part of the entire system, but having one go down results in little to no
protection loss.
In a fraction of a second the client will verify the requests and send a response
back to the pool if the request is valid, otherwise nothing will happen and
the malicious request will never be routed to the destination. All of this work
takes place on the user’s computer and is securely encrypted. Once the cycle is
completed then the contract is completed and the node is awarded a portion of
the Gladius Tokens.
The nodes can be part of multiple pools so long as they fit the demographic
requirements. This means that you can accumulate more GLA so long as your
bandwidth, storage, and computation power can handle it.

GLADIUS NETwork  whITEpApEr
When a node has been approved it will exchange public keys with the pool
manager allowing it to securely transfer information such as IP address and
location. Once this is complete the node ID will be appended to the blockchain as
a member of the pool. This allows verification of the number of members of the
pool.
Each node can communicate with other nodes to exchange information about
which IP addresses are currently flooding the network, or what type of traffic one
node believes is malicious. This strategy can quickly enable a pool wide block of
traffic before the attack even if only one node identifies it.

goes to network support
Cost is determined by the pool provider and split proportionally among the
nodes in the pool with the possibility of a certain percentage being maintained
by the load balancer (as determined by the pool provider). This is to incentivise
the upkeep and maintenance of high quality pools while discouraging anyone
from creating low effort pools with weaker hardware.

GLADIUS NETwork  whITEpApEr
High quality pools will have better ratings and will subsequently be selected
more often by services and sites looking for DDoS protection.
This architecture means there will be extreme competitiveness while also
keeping margins for the pool fairly good due to there being no middle man.
Pools can adjust prices on a need basis (usually to adjust for Gladius Token value).
This will shift prices around occasionally, but pools can have the option to select
a USD value which will change the amount of GLA charged in real-time.
A small percentage of every transaction in the Gladius Marketplace will go back
to the company for purposes of incentivizing open source development and bug
bounties. This will be a negligible amount so as to not discourage pools from

To request DDoS protection, individuals and companies can go onto our web
portal and add a new request for either a website or some other service they
want to protect. This is then communicated with selected pools and activated
in seconds through Ethereum smart contracts. Then all the user needs to do is
change their DNS settings to the ones we generate for them.

Protected Service
The client simply adds the provided domains to their primary nameservers and
the site is protected behind the pool. These domains can expire if the contract
is not renewed, effectively ending service. Additionally the payment is sent
only when the successful completion of a contract occurs. This means every
transaction is provably fair and open.

with them. The pool agrees to provide the client services and the client agrees to
pay them in exchange.
6.7 | DDoS Mitigation
The techniques used to combat malicious requests.
To combat DDoS attacks Gladius nodes inside the pool will perform a number
of services and computations to ensure requests are not malicious. These are all
common techniques used by current DDoS mitigation services and have proven
to be extremely effective in combating attacks (including Layer 7 and beyond).
Rate-Limiting. By identifying IP addresses that are constantly making website
requests, Gladius can block these requests from getting access to the website.
Once the threshold of requests is hit (which is set by the service requestor) the IP
will no longer be able to access the site.
Gladius Network, LLC - 2017                                                            34




GLADIUS NETwork  whITEpApEr
IP Address Matching. Similar to rate-limiting but smarter, IP address matching will
be able to group similar IP address together that have known associations with
each other. This will take shared information from the pool to block threats ahead
of time.
Intelligent Geo Matching. Additionally Gladius can analyze requests and find
geographic anomalies to detect and block attacks.
Browsing Behavior. By using information gathered from the request (whether
it be from a web browser on a headless request), Gladius can pick out obvious
dangers and block the requests in their tracks.
Overall a large amount of the protection utilizes anomaly detection to stop
malicious attacks in their tracks. A key feature of the Gladius Network is that pools
over time will learn about common attackers and block them preemptively for all
other sites and services that are being protected.
Over time there will be new client updates that introduce novel methods of
protection. Gladius will always be looking for new types of attacks and will
quickly respond to them with new prevention software. Pools with a specified
number of outdated clients will also be noted in their reputation, meaning pools
will always be pushing their nodes to update their clients.

6.8 | Content Delivery Network
The techniques used to speed up website load times.
The Gladius network can more effectively deliver fast content than any
existing architecture because of the decentralized nature of it. By having many
relatively low bandwidth nodes spread over a large area, a potential client will
be connected to a node that is extremely close to them. Instead of having a
datacenter far away but with high capacity, a client will connect to someone with
less capacity but very close. Every node will have static file caching so that the
bulk of the data that a client requests will come from a nearby node, while API
calls and other dynamic data will still be passed through to the end server.
To verify that files have not been tampered with by a malicious node, each pool
will be able to send verification requests from the final proxy through another
node to the node being tested. This ensures that each node has no knowledge
of  the other nodes in the network ensuring that they would treat a verification
request like any other. If the files do not match, the pool will have the option to
immediately remove the node, or damage its reputation if it simply has out of
date files.
Pool Proxy                                                                            Node 1   Node 2
Reputation of nodes will also be calculated based on random uptime requests
initiated by the pool as well. Reputation will be treated as a multiplier on top
of the profit earned from the number of requests, so that the total amount the
pool pays out never changes, but shifts from poorly performing nodes to better
performing ones. Additionally content delivery optimizations can and will be
added as the platform matures. From dynamic sampling of website metadata in
order to intelligently update caches, to better and more custom-tailorable load-
balancing techniques, there are dozens of additional features to be added after
the initial release of the Gladius Network.

7.1 | Team Overview
The history of the Gladius team.
The Gladius Team started in early 2017 as a University of Maryland College Park
student team with a specialty in computer science, blockchain technology, and
cybersecurity. Gladius’ founding members set off to research just how effective
blockchain technology could be in the world of cyber security. After looking
into the devastating power and sheer frequency of DDoS attacks along with the
unsatisfactory market conditions, it was clear that the Ethereum blockchain could
be the solution to these problems. Over the course of weeks and months, the
team developed the core architecture that soon became the Gladius Network.
Along with the technology growing, the team has grown in size since then. The
additional talent has enabled the team to quickly create a working prototype for
the upcoming token sale.
