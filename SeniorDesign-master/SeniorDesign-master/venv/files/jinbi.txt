JINBI TOKEN
INTRODUCTION
The Jinbi Token (JNB) merges a traditional gold                                              within seconds. This is possible due to an existing
investment holding with blockchain technology, giving                                        decentralized blockchain technology platform. Jinbi
the token holder the best of both worlds. Everyone                                           has developed this concept further. The blockchain
knows gold and its history as a store of value and                                           technology holds its primary advantages in securing
purchasing power.                                                                            transactions anonymously, fast, safely, traceably and
transparently.
The Cryptocurrency market has adopted some
of gold’s benefits with the creation of crypto
currencies such as bitcoin, a digital coin that can
easily be transferred between peers anonymously
The time has come for the synthesis of both gold and crypto currencies in the Jinbi Token.
This step is the next generation of both investments and we invite you to participate
in this exciting new wave of crypto-assets.
JINBI MEANS GOLD COIN IN MANDARIN.

Token ICO (JNB)
Jinbi has embarked on a blockchain crowdfunding ICO
(Initial Coin Offering) to be launched and completed in Q2
2018, with an aim to raise 88,000,000.00 USD in a 28 day ICO
offer period by launching a crypto token named Jinbi on the
Ethereum blockchain.
Bonus on ICO
During the Pre-ICO and ICO sales, additional bonus Jinbi tokens will be distributed to participants.
The bonus means that extra tokens will be added on top of the deposit amount. For example, if Mr
Smith buys 10 JNB Tokens for $70.40 during the first week of the ICO, he will receive an additional
15% bonus. He will therefore receive 11.5 JNB Tokens, valued at $80.96 in total. Alternatively, if Ms Smith
buys 10 JNB Tokens during week three she will receive 10.5 JNB Tokens. From the start of
the ICO there will be a set amount of bonus tokens awarded each week.
