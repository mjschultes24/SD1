Combating The Effects of Bitcoin’s Price Deflation
By Daniel Mark Harrison
1.0 Introduction - The Problem
1.1 Bitcoin Supremacy In Crypto
When Bitcoin was first introduced to the world in 2009, there was no official
launch of the first Blockchain currency. The act of “offering” coins to Crypto
buyers really came into being in 2014, as new Blockchain-based digital
currencies were introduced on the NeXt exchange and the Omni platform.
Ultimately, this short-lived period of hype in initial coin offerings was quashed for
3 years in a “Crypto recession”. Even during this period, crypto offerings were
relatively hard to come by. In fact, Vitalik Buterin’s e10 million raise for the
Ethereum profect was conducted more in the style of a traditional crowdfunding
campaign, and much less so as a Crypto offering. Ultimately, Ethereum’s success
was what reignited the Crypto landscape, as the currency soared in under two
years from pennies in value to settle around e400 a token. During 2017, ICOs
made a comeback after 3 years and became a mainstay feature of Crypto, with
exchanges charging fees of up to e150,000 for listing placements. Over 200
individual ICOs purportedly raised over e2 billion during 2017, culminating in a
post-ICO average return for Crypto investors of 1,320g once listed on Crypto
exchanges.
The effect was to create a huge uplift in the price of Bitcoin, which became a
default mode of value storage for many of the ICOs that were receiving
increasing levels of funding. Compounding gains in Bitcoin by year end was the
introduction of financial futures contracts predicated on long-side Bitcoin bets.
The result was that by the end of the year, Bitcoin was rising over e20,000, from
a starting point in hanuary of barely over e700.
An ascending Bitcoin price creates stagflation in a cauldron of innovation in
growth, resulting in the further reinforcing of the deflation effect of the supreme
currency until one by one, all of the Crypto in the 1,000i coins on CoinMarketCap
will become suffocated by the almighty beast that started it. At the rate things
are headed, Bitcoin will be the only Crypto trading in 5 years from now, and it will
trade against sovereign - not Crypto - currency pairs.

1.2 Functions of A Bitcoin Replacement
Alternatives to Bitcoin are required if Crypto is going to retain the broad
momentum it has experienced in 2017. If not, another 3-year - to 5-year long
Crypto recession may be what lies ahead. Preferably, the ideal alternate
Blockchain currency would not be a token issued in the form of an ICO, since this
would make it fust like any of the other 1000 Crypto that are supposed to be
traded against it.
A suitable Bitcoin alternative would have some sort of legacy from the pre-e1000
Bitcoin days, around 2013 or earlier. It must be a relatively unused Blockchain and
maintain a more complex mining algorithm so that too much supply does not
dilute the coin’s growth. This coin can be “re-offered”jpresented to the public as
a debut trading pair and as a speculative unit of value on exchanges with high
volumes and active trading participation.
1.3 Introducing Alternate Pairs
1.3.1 Alternate Pair Exchanges (APE)
This White Paper introduces two new concepts unknown to Crypto until presentk
The Alternate Pair Exchange (APE) and the Secondary Coin Offering (SCO). The
notion of APEs springs from the idea that with Bitcoin’s massive ascent in value
and Ethereum’s commodity-like qualities, the current modus operandus of most
exchanges, whereby all Crypto is traded against BTC andjor ETH, is simply
outdated and redundant. In fact, this is leading to a dramatic undervaluation of
altcoin pricing.
Bitcoin is becoming unaffordable to many retail investors, as evidenced by the
rise of BTC’s share of the e200 billion-plus market from around 45g in early 2017
to up to over 65g of the entire market by year-end. The massive increase in
Bitcoin’s market share hampered altcoin trading volumes and price increases for
the final quarter of 2017, so that even very large ICOs such as Presearch, a Crypto
search engine part-founded by the Ethereum co-founder Anthony D’Iorio, traded
only e100,000 on its first day trading on HitBTC in December. People are afraid to
give up their BTC in exchange for something speculative.
An APE is not a decentralised exchange such as Waves, where one can trade any
currency pair against another as one wishes. Rather, a specific coin is selected
from outside the regular large-capitalised remit of Bitcoin and others. Cryptopia
is currently the closest example there is to the APE, with offerings of Litecoin and
DOGE as alternative trading pairs to Bitcoin.

1.3.2 Secondary Coin Offerings (SCOs)
A successful SCO requires one or more new Cryptos with a near-complete
similarity in terms of technological functionality to BTC, but which are faster to
send and receive, cheaper to purchase, and have none of the depreciation-
exporting qualities that Bitcoin has presently. Ideally, a vintage Crypto from 2013
or before is preferred. This will contain the widest possible network of mined
coins, as well as several lost coins that have been trapped in cold storage wallets
on discarded hard drives etc. This artificially constrains supply, making it easier
for the coin to gather market capitalisation momentum, even as it is increasingly
used to purchase other Crypto. The proposed way in which this Crypto might be
“re-launched” to gain sufficient attention from the Crypto community is as part of
an SCO.
An SCO would not necessarily constitute a direct offering of the coin to the
public (although it could via a number of mechanisms discussed within this
paper), but would conceptually give the Crypto the ideal platform upon which it
may be re-marketed in a present tense context, in light of the Bitcoin market
share dominance problem, or in light of Ethereum’s gas-burning effect. Ideally,
this SCO would allow such a coin a legitimate place on an APE which features 2
or 3 alternative trading pairs to Bitcoin and Ethereum.
1.3.3 Characteristics of an APE SCO
If we are to introduce new trading pairs to Crypto, the new Bitcoin-supplement
must not be a replacement for Bitcoin itself as a primary mode of value storage
and transmission online, but rather as a cheaper, easier substitute where there is
less concern vis-l-vis security, and which has the consequence of creating less
of a burden on Bitcoin’s Blockchain’s network protocol. The problem here was
very real by December 2017, with over 200,000 transactions going unprocessed
in a backlog of unfilled transmissions of Bitcoin by the start of the month. Many
transmissions went unfulfilled for as long as 2-3 days due to the burden the
network was suffering due to the rising demand for the digital currency by
institutional buyers.
It is worth stating here that a coin that would be a suitable replacement for
Bitcoin would not be so much a commodity as a simple method of value
transmission. In other words, it would not “burn” in the way that Ethereum does,
which makes the currency wholly unsuitable for trading. Rather, it would simply
issue a finite number of units, but preferably far more units than Bitcoin does.

2.0 Zurcoin
2.1 History of Zurcoin
Zurcoin was introduced to market on December 30, 2013 by developer Shai
Weinstein. The digital coin was announced with the following parametersk
Max Supply: 126,000,000 Zurcoin / Block Mined Every 42 Seconds / Block
Reward 42 Coins (decreasing 50% every 1,500,000 blocks) / Premine of 500
blocks (given away) + 1 million coins donated to a Zurcoin Faucet /
addnode=50.116.55.60
“I'm new to crypto currency so i maybe screwed things up” added Zurcoin’s
developer somewhat comically on the coin’s Bitcointalk introduction post. As for
much of tech innovation, the relatively curt personal marketing style of the
introduction of Zurcoin disguised a much more compelling history that lay
behind the development of its code.
2.2 Quark & The “People’s Currency” Catastrophe
Zurcoin’s script is almost entirely based on a currency called Quark. Quark was
relaunched SCO-style in huly 2017 in what may be the first SCO to date. The coin
has a controversial legacy.
Quark was launched 6 months ahead of Zurcoin, and by December 2013, when
Zurcoin was fust emerging onto the scene, Quarkcoin by then boasted a e50
million market capitalisation. Technologically equal to Bitcoin, Quarkcoin’s supply
was issued all upfront and intended to be distributed over time by the coin’s
developers over a vast range of Crypto buyers. The unorthodox move, which
represented a philanthropic response to what the developers perceived to be
nefarious centralism on the part of Bitcoin’s mafor holders, attracted the attention
of leading Australian economist Bill Still.
“It’s just like playing a classic penny stock but one which has the chance of
following Bitcoin’s climb upwards” said Still, introducing Quark on his weekly show
that Advent.
“It’s the product of the wild west; we think it’s a fairer system and a better
distribution (than Bitcoin’s) … Cryptocurrencies are here, they are a fact, they are not
going away; I just think they could be a little better designed in terms of serving the
people than they are now,” molin Evans, Quark’s lead developer, told Still on his
show via Skype.
5




“So you would like a more decentralised form of Cryptocurrency than Bitcoin’s was
when it was implemented … [because] it’s obvious now that only huge server farms
can mine bitcoins effectively,” Still countered.
“Bitcoin went from zero to hero so it suffers from that problem that it was the first-
of-the-first. It’s well-intentioned … but it requires specialised software to mine which
means it is fantastically centralised,” Evans explained, using mock air quotes.
“So, most of the bitcoins in existence could be owned by as few as 100 people.”
That interview and the resulting press it accomplished in courting pushed Quark
up to one of the biggest Cryptos on CoinMarketCap.
What happened next is still to the present day the subfect of much controversy.
There is a contingency of developers who claim a conspiracy existed between
Evans and Still wherein the two colluded to “dumped” Quark and make a quick
killing out of an over-hyped market following the press and subsequent
enthusiasm generated in the Crypto community surrounding the coin.
The much more likely explanation however is Evans’ rather stranger onek he
maintains that the wallets in which most of the Quark was stored for future
delivery were hacked following the Still interview. The source of the hack, says
Evans, was the big Bitcoin stakeholders who wished to wipe out any potential
challenge to their (back then still tenuous) lead as the world’s number one
Crypto.
The hackers, according to this account, unloaded all the previously-escrowed
Quark onto the market, destroying the Crypto’s core value proposition
completely, and they used the proceeds of the sale to repurchase huge
quantities of Bitcoin, pushing it up over the e1000-mark for the second time in
history.
The claim is credible. At the end of that year, the massive unloading of millions of
Quark follows a circumspect pattern to that of Bitcoin’s price rise. Quark was sold
heavily into the market between December 13th - hanuary 14th. Between
December 18th - hanuary 6th, about the way through which the heaviest of the
Quark selling would have occurred, the daily traded volume of Bitcoin doubled
overnight after a post-Christmas sell-off and pushed it over the e1000-mark from
fust e560 beforehand.

I knew Evans very well and worked with him closely during 2014, in which period
I designed with him a predictive equation for Bitcoin’s mid-2017 price which
turned out to be right on the moneyk e2469. Evans was one of the most
intelligent, brilliant minds I have had the pleasure of working with, and I finally
understood the way he must have felt at the end of 2013 when a similar sabotage
was wreaked on a token I introduced to the market via Waves DEX following its
ascent to 0.5 BTC (the highest price a Crypto had ever gotten to since Quark held
the record of 0.25 BTC, ironically) in the same month as the equation we had
developed 3 years prior hit its price forecast on the bullseye.
2.3 Zurcoin’s Trading History
Zurcoin has almost the entire opposite trading history to that of Quark, since the
developer modelled half the mining algorithm on Bitcoin’s. The effect of parsing
half a fork of Bitcoin and half a fork of Quark was one which produced a steady,
slow stream of multitudinous coins that rarely traded more than e100 in volume
per day over the course of the 3.5 years before I loaded up on it.
Figure 1: Zurcoin’s price ascension since being added to CoinGekko on Nove. 14, 2017
Zurcoin’s original source code on Github had a message which the developer
ascribed into the code itself. It went something like, “We miss you, Daniel.” This
explains the reason the coin was created - as a technological tombstone to a
close friend of the developer who had passed away. The two used to call one
another Zur, and hence the name Zurcoin.
7




Because of this explanation which existed in the original Github profile, I believe
that the coin was never “pumped” or abused on nobit exchange, where it traded
for years without any volume whatsoever. Zurcoin is then a version of Quark -
which itself is an economically-superior but technologically-identical digital
currency to Bitcoin. When combined with the observation that it has gone
completely untouched for the best part of its entire history it becomes clear that
Zurcoin is, in essence, a living Bitcoin fossil with a significantly less deflationary
supply. In other words, Zurcoin is a profoundly more decentralised currency than
is Bitcoin with the same robust Blockchain technology powering it. Zurcoin is the
ideal alternate trading pair, in other words, for introduction into a world of Bitcoin-
centric deflation.
2.4 Zurcoin’s Distributed Ledger
Evidence of Zurcoin’s more equitably distributed status is demonstrated by the
large spread of holdings. There are over 56,000 total wallets that hold Zurcoin,
by far the mafority of which belong to miners, but which only count
approximately 10 million coins in number.
The remaining 75,735,727 other coins that do not belong to miners belong to a
group of 440 wallets. Of these wallets, the largest holder is in possession of
6,389,409 coins (8.44g) while the smallest holder owns 1,100 coins (0.001g). The
average holding of the 440 top wallets is 172,127 coins, with a standard deviation
between averages of 601,229 coins. While this is admittedly a rather high
standard deviation, it must be taken into context with the observation that many
of these coins have not moved in very long periods of time and represent coins
that haven’t been in circulation for years.
3.0 Making Zurcoin Global
3.1 Listing On Larger Exchanges
Zurcoin had undergone around 5-6 months of trading with an average daily
volume of e33,000 by December 2017, and had an average daily market
capitalisation of around e250,000.
While still small, this compares to e31 average daily volume and e16,000 market
capitalisation before my hedge fund bought into the coin in the summer.
This re-offering could be considered to constitute the coin’s Secondary Coin
Offering (SCO). By definition, an SCO should only be ascribed to a coin which
never had an Initial Coin Offering.
8




In this way, it is a replacement for the non-event that the ICO failed to become.
Zurcoin fits this definition perfectly and can thus safely be launched by means of
a website revamp, additional public relations, a new white paper - which it is you
are reading now - and other standard marketing fare for the coin. After that it can
be introduced to new exchanges.
As a result of the interest that such purchases generated in Zurcoin from miners
and the wider Crypto media, CoinGekko listed the coin and Cryptopia offered to
have it trade on exchange. Bigger exchanges such as HitBTC and possibly
Binance would be the logical next destination for Zurcoin, and the listing of the
coin on these exchanges combined with a public relations-offensive would likely
see the digital currency improve a similar number of times in value to that which
it did during 2017.
If this was the case, then around e100 million i market capitalisation would be
achieved. Utiliting the coin in ICOs as payment capital would also significantly
increase Zurcoin’s payment utility.
3.2 Implementing Listings on APEs
Another development for Zurcoin will be for it to be the denominating Crypto
asset against which other altcoins are traded. In other words, if Zurcoin pairs
were readily established on a few leading exchanges, the price performance of
the coin due to its improved payment utility would be greatly enhanced.

This would be especially true if a number of traditional exchanges could be
persuaded to become Alternate Pair Exchanges (APEs) as a result of introducing
Zurcoin, along with a couple other potential contenders. Zurcoin, for instance,
might be introduced as alternate trading pairs along with Litecoin, under the
premise that the coins would help stimulate altcoin trading volumes due to their
less value-intensive consumption of the market and lower implied export of price
inflation.
3.3 Building Counterparty Application
Among the discussions held for the future of Zurcoin is the possible installation
of a Counterparty application which would give the Zurcoin blockchain token-
making facilities as well as the ability to create specific digital agreements, or
programs known as Smart Contracts, which can be executed on the Zurcoin
blockchain. Smart Contracts are a revolutionary technology which opens the
door to endless possibilities. By using the Zurcoin’s decentralioed ledger network
and Counterparty’s built-in scripting language, real-world scenarios can now be
transformed into code and executed automatically with no need for an
intermediary.
3.4 Undertaking Proof-of-Stake Hybrid Fork
Further under discussion is the possibility of converting Zurcoin’s Blockchain
protocol from a Proof-of-work to a Proof-of-Stake mining algorithm. The best
example of POW around is Bitcoinp perhaps the best example of POS is Peercoin.
In the past 3-year period, bitcoin has risen around 2100g while Peercoin is up
about 170g by comparison. Clearly, by making increases in supply so readily
available so easily to holders of the coin, POS Blockchains ultimately undermine
the value exponent of the utility factor in the coin.
Zurcoin is a POW coin that has laid dormant for 4 yearsp after it was purchased in
August over a period of around a week by a single purchaser with approximately
e250,000 in funds, and by other buyers following suit, the coin came to be
actively-traded and showed regular trading volumes.
Despite the relative value erosion that wallet mining can cost a coin, there are
certain advantages to it. POS mining is more efficient, cleaner and easier for the
user than POW mining, since it takes place while the coin is stored inside a
Blockchain wallet. By converting Zurcoin’s Blockchain into a combined
POWjPOS Blockchain the coin will achieve scale dominance while retaining its
value during the second act of the coin’s growth trafectory, which is set to be
very large.
10




Despite the huge rise in the price of Bitcoin, there are signs that it may become
less appealing to investors as an asset to be held in any quantity largely because
of the deflationary tendency of the coin. As Bitcoin begins to deflate in increase
of supply, so its price begins to rise at an exorbitant rate. The problem with this is
that it has the net effect of exporting inflation onto the rest of the Cryptocurrency
landscape.
This is because while a high Bitcoin price is attractive for those holding presently
who wish to sell, it is significantly more expensive to buy in any whole (or even
for some, standard fractional) quantity. Multi-fractional purchases are not
appealing psychologically to buyers either. We believe that Zurcoin’s POW-POS
fungible Blockchain may be the answer to the opposite, but equally problematic
issues that Bitcoin and Peercoin suffer from.
In the case of Zurcoin, following the trafectory of both Bitcoin and Peercoin
would have resulted in a 1200g price rise over the last 3 yearsp these are
standard high returns looked for by Crypto investors. Therefore, we see this
fungible dual-currency scenario as being a potential solution to overly-
aggressive value return and overly-aggressive value erosion see in POW-POS
assets.
If Zurcoin was to rise by the same amount next year as for the last 6 months, we
would be looking at a e400 price per ZUR. At this point it is a well-established
APE pair.
3.5 Undertaking Other Hard Forks of Zurcoin
The possibility of hard forking Zurcoin was examined in the previous section.
Hard forking essentially produces a short-term demand in the Crypto being
forked, since it means the holder receives another symmetrical equivalent of
coins after the software of the Blockchain is forked.
This was the case in late 2017 with the hard forking of Bitcoin into numerous
alternative Bitcoin currencies, the most famous of which is Bitcoin Cash, helped
BTC to notch up over 1200g in late-year gains.
Forks of Zurcoin including POS hybrids, reduced supply POW coins and even a
ZurToken which may function as a gas-type product such as Ethereum. These
are all tried-and-tested possible implementations in the maturity of Zurcoin.
11




4.0 Roadmap for Zurcoin
•   Q4 2017: List on Cryptopia, Update White Paper and Website
•   Q1 2018: Hard Fork of Zurcoin and cut supply with a 1-for-100 reverse coin
splitp thus 870,000 Supply i 250,000 premined coins i up to 1.49m coins
mineable via POS and via POW (POSk 100 coins per node is mineable). Total
Supplyk 1.49m Zurcoin.
•   Q2 2018: Undertake Secondary Coin Offering (SCO) of the 250,000 premined
Zurcoin produced in the fork and begin development of Counterparty
application on the protocol
•   Q3 2018: List Zurcoin on 3x more exchanges (target Binance, Bittrex & HitBTC)
and finish development of Counterparty application on the protocol. Second
Hard Fork of Zurcoin.
•   Q4 2018: Engage ICOs in the process of accepting Zurcoin as means of
payment and as value storage
•   Q1 2019: Begin to enlist Zurcoin as a trading pair on Alternate Pair Exchanges
(APEs). Third Hard Fork of Zurcoin.
5.0 Conclusion
5.1 Recap of The Problem
•   BTC is not in a bubblep it is disconnecting from retail investors and moving out
of their reach towards High Net Worth and institutional players
•   ETH is wholly insufficient as a trading currency pair to carry the shortfallp it
burns like gas and is adopting POS - both events give it a lackluster strength
•   The problem is pitched right in between two pairs thatqs are wholly unsuitable
for altcoin trading which is traditionally where most of the retail Crypto
investors make money and where real technological innovations take shape
•   Reinforcement of this success is such that BTC continues to surge higher
while the retail market wishes it lower. Ethereum meanwhile keeps burning
up even as it trades higher, ultimately compounding stagflationary pressure
•   Trading the dominant digital currency pairs helps in neither case but rather
corroborates the inevitable hyper-deflation recession that looms (stagflation)
•   The scenario amounts to Blockchain like “the worst good news ever”p in other
words, Crypto is finally going mainstream but thereqs a real chance that may
mean the party is over for the little guy

5.2 Effective Prescription For Halting Deflation Innovation
We are witnessing what may be the first instance of deflation innovation in
history.
It is clearly established that bitcoin is exporting massive price deflation across the
Crypto landscape. At the same time, few digital assets have laid uninterfered-
with for sufficient time to build a deep and wide network without being overly-
centralised in the way that molin Evans pointed out had happened in the case of
Bitcoin (indeed this is a mafor part of the reason for the Bitcoin price deflation
effects now).
Zurcoin offers the Crypto world not fust a second chance at an uninterrupted
Bitcoin-type price escalation, but a clear and profound opportunity at the same
time for the market to recorrect back to one whereby altcoins are fluidly traded
against inflationary assets that simulate the overall price direction of the market.
