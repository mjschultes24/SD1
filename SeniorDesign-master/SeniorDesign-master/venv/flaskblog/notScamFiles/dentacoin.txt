Abstract
Founded in March 2017, Dentacoin Foundation develops the first Blockchain solution
for the global dental industry. Driven by a vast community of progressive dentists,
software developers and marketing specialists, the Foundation has managed to
create a new dental ecosystem which favors all industry stakeholders: patients,
dentists, manufacturers, suppliers, labs, insurance companies.
Through a common, industry-specific cryptocurrency Dentacoin (DCN) and several
Blockchain-based software tools, all market participants are securely interconnected,
empowered to efficiently exchange information and values.
The core purpose of the Foundation is to improve long-term health, reduce costs and
pain, and continuously support the growth in the value of the DCN currency.
Dentacoin develops the dental industry as well as creates market intelligence through
a cryptocurrency reward system that inspires participation throughout the
community.
Looking forward, Dentacoin expects the platform to drastically improve dental health
and hygiene habits, thus improving the quality of life for individuals resulting in
improved overall health and increased longevity.

Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to thoroughly explain a new conceptual framework to be
used within the dental industry for organizational purposes. Through the utilization of
recent technological innovations, we have created a model with the ability to
overcome the majority of the dental industries' major constraints and furthermore,
proposes various measures that will significantly improve the efficiency of dental
practice thus improving the patients' level of dental well-being.
Dentacoin strives to create a dental industry community by rewarding people -who
provide valuable contributions- with crypto currency. Through this reward system, the
foundation will see a rise in a currency that will be able to reach a broad market,
including a vast number of people who have yet to participate in any cryptocurrency
economy.
According to Harvard Business Review: “To protect the blockchain vision from
political pressure and regulatory interference, blockchain networks rely on a
decentralized infrastructure that can't be controlled by any one person or group."
The integration of blockchain and dentistry is an extraordinary concept; one that
requires the creation of a community in which transparency and shared responsibility
can take place.

Mission Statement
The Dentacoin Foundations' core missions are to improve the quality of dental care
worldwide, reduce treatment costs and create a dental community. The Dentacoin
Token was created to help assist the Dentacoin Foundation with the above
mentioned missions by giving power to the people. Dentacoin focuses on developing
a number of tools, each one targeting a different sector of the dental industry.
Individuals who use and implement these tools will receive Dentacoin Tokens as a
reward, which they can later use to pay for their dental treatment or to purchase
dental products.
The goal is not to compete with other cryptocurrencies, but rather to provide a
solution and support for the healthcare industry through a blockchain. The Dentacoin
Foundation is interested in evaluating the actual substance and value that can be
created with a coin (Dentacoin) that represents the health of all individuals. Dentacoin
will be both a Fin Tech and logistic platform of the global dental industry.
The Foundation's exact contribution in ERC20 coins (Dentacoins) used for dental
projects will be provided later on in the whitepaper.
Core Objectives
All service industries aiming at long-term success are driven by their customers’
feedback. The healthcare Industry is no exception. No regulatory authority, no central
institution, no powerful organization or individual could control the industry better
than the patient community. People trust people, thus there is nothing more valuable
to the industry players than constant, trustworthy feedback from the patients.
However, a community needs to exist for this to be achieved and this is where
Dentacoin steps in.
Dentacoin emphasizes the industry’s challenges and reveals the solutions for
increasing the dental practice’s efficiency. Implementing a blockchain based industrial
cryptocurrency can incentivize the industry in solving the majority of the existing and
future constraints. Below are the 4 phases of implementation each with its own
milestones, goals, and focus.
5




Project Development Phases
Phase I: Blockchain-Based Trusted Review Platform
Through creating and implementing the first Blockchain-based platform for trusted
dental treatment reviews, the Dentacoin Foundation will allow patients voices to be
heard and dentists will have access to up-to-date, extremely valuable market research
data and qualified patient feedback - the most powerful tool to improve service
quality and to establish a loyal patient base. Through a self- executing Smart
Contract, the Dentacoin review platform will assure optimal autonomy, trust, speed,
and safety thus mitigating any risks in connection with manipulations.
The brand new, blockchain-based feedback system (smart contract) will trigger a
dynamic movement in patients and dentists to open DCN wallets.
There will be a Dentacoin community that will create the prerequisites for the future
steps that will be taken to penetrate the global market and will provide valuable
market research results.
At this moment in time, Dentacoins’ developers are working on the frontend, the
address database and the smart contract. This platform is already presented in the
market despite the fact that the ICO only takes place in October 2017. Once the ICO
begins the market offensive strategies and the advertising campaigns for the global
expansion will be implemented and create a rapid growing community of patients
and dentists.
Benefits:
  Transparent reviews
  Once on the blockchain, reviews cannot be modified or manipulated
  Permanent data storage
  Market research value
  Patients will have access to the rating and reviews of each dentist and can base
their decision of which dentist to go to on the provided information.
  Patients will have the option to speak out and present their opinions.
  Dentacoin (DCN) will be diversely distributed. Every single review is rewarded
from the foundation subject to the foundation having stock of DCNs.
  The creation of closed economic system
6




The basic idea is to provide and maintain a decentralized review platform based on
Ethereum smart contracts. This website rewards high quality "patient reviews” and
“market research surveys” with Dentacoin. The incentive structure has a strong
influence on the quality of dental treatments and increases the mutual responsibility
between dentists and patients.
The review project will be the first major milestone on Dentacoins' roadmap to the
future of dentistry.
Dentacoin's own research and experience in dental business teaches one important
need that concerns dentists worldwide: The need to build strong relationships with
clients and gaining valuable feedback /market research data to enhance their
treatment plans and communications.
On the other hand, patients lack a reliable source where different dentists can be
compared by means of their rating and reviews as well as the possibility to give
anonymous and unfiltered feedback when sharing their thoughts and opinions.
Through the platform, patients will be able to find specific dentists in order to write
an anonymous review. Each survey will be linked to the Ethereum blockchain and
paid for in Dentacoin by a smart contract. In return, the earned amount can be used
to pay for part of the further treatments at one of our partner dentists/clinics.
By providing ways to earn and spend Dentacoin, the dental currency will be
distributed throughout the industry. Furthermore: Dentacoin collects important
knowledge of the industry and makes it available to all dentists and patients, thus
allowing dentists and patients to form strong communities around the world and
build upon mutual interest.
Preliminary test campaigns signalled a strong demand towards the trusted review
platform.
Next step: Trusted reviews
In order to provide trust worthier customer reviews, Dentacoin will implement a new
notion of "trusted reviews“, thus the review platform will have both standard reviews
and trusted reviews. Standard reviews, which can be written by anyone and trusted
reviews, which can only be written by actual patients.
To ensure that a reviewer writes the feedback based on a prior treatment, each
partner dentist will ask for the patients’ e-mail address in the medical office and right
before each treatment, the patient will get an email containing a review request link.
7




This link then leads to reviews.dentacoin.com, where the review form is marked as
trusted and linked to the dentist/dental team in question.
Trusted reviews are rewarded with a higher amount of Dentacoin (DCN) than a
standard review.
These trusted reviews would be seen as highly beneficial to the dentist and the
industry as it will lead to an increase in trust gained and reviews of a higher quality
and reliability standard which would result in more valuable market research data.
The community will benefit from these trusted reviews due to the fact that the
reviews are of a higher quality and reliability, which accomplishes an objective
reference to each dentist’s services, thus rendering them comparable.
Due to the transparent, incentive-based and censorship resistant nature of the
blockchain based solution, Dentacoin will create an extremely well functional review
and market research system that will be accessible at reviews.dentacoin.com for all
contributors.
Phase II: Dentacare Mobile App and DentaVox Opinion
Platform
"Repetition of the same thought or physical action develops into a habit which,
repeated frequently enough, becomes an automatic reflex." - Norman Vincent Peale
Dentacare Mobile app aims to form long-lasting dental care habits through an
intensive 3-month program in an engaging gamified environment. Through
reminders, notifications, voice navigation and tutorials, users will be taught how to
improve their dental hygiene and thus, form healthy habits. The app educates users
how to brush, floss, rinse properly and advises them further on how to take proper
care of their teeth with regular check-ups, better nutrition, etc. An emergency
function implemented allows users to get advice from the dental specialists within
the Dentacoin network in case of problems. The app is tremendously beneficial for
children as well, as forming dental hygiene habits at a young age prevents the
formation of deeper dental problems in future.
The basic initial program lasts for 3 months, as it is considered that this is the time
slot needed for a certain activity to be permanently integrated into the daily routine
of an individual.
8




Only after maintaining a proper routine for a 3-month period, users will be rewarded
with Dentacoin tokens, which they can later use for paying for dental services, dental
care products, Dentacoin Assurance, or they can store them or trade on exchange
platforms and thus, benefit from the expected value multiplication.
“This is not the wisdom of the crowd, but the wisdom of someone in the crowd. It’s
not that the network itself is smart; it’s that the individuals get smarter because
they’re connected to the network.” - Steven Johnson
DentaVox is a collective customer intelligence tool, that rewards users for their honest
opinions on variety of dental health topics while simultaneously forms valuable up-
to-date market research data for dentists, suppliers, manufacturers. Thus, all
Dentacoin network participants are in a win-win situation.
DentaVox consists of questionnaires on variety of Healthcare topics with different
length - from 8 to 100 questions, placed in an engaging interactive environment. The
rewards in DCN are allocated according to the user efforts. Smart mechanism detects
the concentration of the users when filling in the surveys in order to guarantee high-
quality results and prevent manipulations.
DentaVox is a tribune for users to speak out, give their honest opinions, get rewarded
and have a strong influence on the industry, as no one could ignore, delete or
manipulate their true opinions. The statistics from each open questionnaire are visible
to all registered users. They could then be used by dentists, suppliers, manufacturers,
media as up-to-date, extremely valuable market research data and as a tool for
constant service/ treatment/ product/ process improvement. Furthermore, DentaVox
will offer options for businesses to conduct custom surveys, based on a pre-targeted
audience.
Phase III: Dental Assurance Concept
Dentacoin’s 'unique feedback platform will be supported by various other value-
creating solutions devoted to achieving the same purpose -to improve dental care
quality worldwide-.
The revolutionary, blockchain dental insurance will become one of Dentacoin’s most
powerful tools in the dental industry, as explained below.
Dentacoin has created a uniquely original dental insurance smart contract that will
exist between the individual and their corresponding dentist in order to achieve the
9




above-mentioned purpose. If agreed upon by both parties, the contract becomes
tradable within the blockchain, this allows for the creation of value to be held by the
contract. All smart contracts in existence will form part of a "super smart contract".
"Super smart contracts" ensure that the patient is covered in the case of insolvency or
death of the dentist.
The smart contract focuses on the alignment of both parties' main interest - to
maintain healthy teeth and overall oral hygiene. By entering into the smart contract,
both the dentist and patient have obligations and duties to fulfil, upon completion,
both parties will reap the benefits of the smart contract. Patients must attain the oral
hygiene and care that is set out in the Dentacare mobile app and dentists, who
restore and maintain their patients’ teeth at their own expense, are to perform their
job to the utmost quality and satisfaction. If both parties' duties and obligations are
met, monetary rewards will be issued. This monetary motivation method creates an
environment where both parties whilst performing to reach a common goal are
simultaneously benefitting themselves and the dental industry as high levels of
personal health are met as well as a high quality performance from the dentists.
Phase IV: Healthcare Database
Blockchain offers a model, which has the potential to enable secure lifetime medical
record sharing across all healthcare providers. The rationale for considering a
blockchain in electronic health care records is twofold. First, it avoids adding another
organization between the patient and the records. The blockchain implies a
decentralized control mechanism in which all have an interest, but no one exclusively
owns it. This is an architectural change that generalizes past medical records.‘2
‘Second, it adds due consideration to a time-stamped, programmable ledger. That
opens the door for intelligent control of record access without having to create
custom functionality for each vendor. The ledger also inherently includes an audit
trail.’3
2 John D. Halamka, MD, Andrew Lippman and Ariel Ekblaw, ‘The Potential for Blockchain to Transform Electronic
Health Records’ (Harvard Business Review, 3 March 2017) <https://hbr.org/2017/03/the-potential-for-blockchain-
to-transform-electronic-health-records>
3                                                                                                                Dugan Maddux, MD, FACP, Vice President, Kidney Disease Initiatives,'Cybersecurity and Blockchain in Health
Care’ (Acumen Physical Solutions, 24 April 2017) <https://acumenmd.com/blog/cybersecurity-and-blockchain-in-
health-care/>; HibBucket,’Artificial Intelligence Blockchain Research and Development’ (HubBucket Healthcare
Blockchain-HubBlockchain) <http://hubblockchain.com/>
10




The blockchain has the potential to standardize secure data exchange in a less
burdensome way than previous approaches.
As the DCN distribution model is aimed at value creation for the dental industry
worldwide, each patient activity, which generates value for the dental industry, will be
rewarded with Dentacoin. DCNs could later be used for paying dental treatments.
Dentists, on the other hands, could consider DCN as a financial investment or they
could remunerate employees for their extraordinary performance in the workplace.
They could also pay suppliers in Dentacoin with no extra time, no middlemen and no
more high international transaction costs. This direct connection between producers
and dentists will then allow dentists to provide lower prices to patients.
The currency cycle is closed. Moreover, the establishment of Dentacoin as an
industrial currency will put all market players - suppliers, dentists, and patients - in a
“win-win-win” situation.
Roadmap
This section aims to explain the different phases Dentacoin intends to progress
through over the next few years, and the various milestones connected with each
phase Dentacoin wishes to achieve for the users, developers, and the industry overall.
In total, there are 4 phases, namely: Knowledge, Expansion, Determination and
Eternity.
Each phase and its corresponding milestones, goals, and focuses are set out below.
1)  Knowledge - Gather the required market data, using a blockchain based review
network to create a global, growing database.
2)  Expansion - Create a global community and motivate the participants to  make
use of the DCN currency.
3)  Determination - Implement a decentralized insurance model.
4)  Eternity - Build up DCN infrastructure for direct international trading between
dentists and suppliers in cooperation with UPS, Alibaba and Amazon.
11




The Roadmap of Dentacoin is shown below:
The first major step after the release of the Dentacoin token on February 14th was the
establishment and registration of the Dentacoin Foundation in Maastricht, The
Netherlands on the 03.03.2017.
There are no obligations of any kind of token-holders towards the Foundation.
Neither is there any obligation of any kind whatsoever on the part of the Foundation
towards token-holders.
12




The public presale commenced on the 1st of July, 2017 (during which 16177500000
DCNs' were distributed) and the gathered funds are being used to create a team of
front and back end developers for the Trusted Review Platform Testnet, the
programming, and launching of the Trusted Review Platform (testnet) and its
supporting tools, being the Dentacare mobile app and the DentaVox opinion
platform.
Following the public presale, the testnet version of the review platform will be
launched on the 8th of August 2017.
On the 1st of October 2017, the first token sale will be publicly held during which up
to 3% of the overall DCN amount will be distributed. Later distribution will happen
through further token sales and our tools. The tokens that are not distributed during
the year of their release will be locked and distributed after 2042. They will be
released based on how much supply there is on the market during that period and if
it aligns with the token distribution supply plan. In case there is a higher amount of
tokens on the market than what was planned in the distribution supply plan, we will
then release an amount that will fit the inflation ratios.
Once all the necessary data from the test phase of the trusted review network has
been gathered and analysed, necessary changes will be made to the testnet based on
the gathered data and upon the completion of the testnet alterations, the Trusted
Review Platform (mainnet) will launch later on in the 2017 year.
In Q4 of 2017 DentaVox Market Research platform will be launched. In May 2018
Dentacoin Integrated Platform will be introduced, along with Dentacoin Assurance
Testnet in Q4 of 2018.
During 2019 the Foundation plans Healthcare Database Integration.
The Dentacoin Foundation was the first to develop a solution in the blockchain for
the dental industry and has the potential to be the market leader in this industry.
13




The Strength of Dentacoin
The Dentacoin Foundation recognizes that the value of all user contributions (reviews,
recommendations, rewards, payments, trusted feedback, etc.) is one of the most
important assets to the foundation. A single review is worth next to nothing, but
millions of trusted and impartial reviews are worth many millions (or possibly even
billions) of euros.
Individuals should be paid for everything they do that brings value not only to
Dentacoin but also to the dental industry.
A major breakthrough for Dentacoin was the purchase of a real existing dental clinic,
the Dentaprime International Plc. London.
The transfer of ownership took place in July 2017 once the purchase price had been
paid. This transaction was phenomenal due to the fact that the calculated purchase
price to the value of 90 million USD was paid entirely in DCN. This means that even
before the ICO, the DCN was given a high, real value by professionals of the M&A
field. This purchase is unique in the history of the blockchain tokens. The Dentacoin
Foundation will continue to be active in M&A and will purchase additional clinics if
they can take a pilot function within Dental Industry 4.0.
14




Possibility of Indirect Profit Sharing
Once a year, there is a possibility that the Dentacoin Foundation will be able to
change back the Dentacoin tokens from market for Ether or Bitcoin with up to 50% of
the operating profit. This will have the effect that the global DCN supply decreases.
On the other hand, the Dentacoin Foundation may use the 50% of the operating
profit to reinvest into the tools that are being developed by the Dentacoin
Foundation.
The decision how to use the resources - including any profits and liquidation
proceeds - will be only and at every time in the hands of the management of the
foundation. The operating profit includes interests from assets, profits of the clinics
bought by the Foundation and any other return on investment.
Token  Creation
There are 8,000,000,000,000 (eight trillion) coins pre-mined. A “DCN” refers to one
individual Dentacoin and because it is an ERC20 token, it is configured to be used
globally by all individuals and its value is derived from the exchange with Ether. The
symbol ٨ has been chosen to represent a DCN.
15

Payments  Handling
Dentistry today is a growing, high-tech oriented, 500 billion USD industry4. Dentacoin
is the first and only crypto coin created as a payment method in the dental industry
worldwide.
The Dentacoin Foundation will implement a state channel payment method. This
method operates in a similar manner as to how payments of cheques are handled. In
simple terms, a person (the benefiter) can receive a check from a bank account holder
as means of payment.
In order for the payee to receive the amount of money promised on the cheque, the
issuer’s name and benefiter’s name must be written on the face of the cheque, the
amount and currency specified and it should be signed (authorized) by the bank
account holder. If all conditions are met this cheque order becomes exchangeable at
the bank for the amount of money promised. The exchange, however, may not be
completed due to insufficient funds in the issuer’s account and hence denied.
The transfer of Dentacoin (DCN) operates in a similar manner to the abovementioned
example. Upon the wishes of one user (X) to obtain services or goods from another
user (B), the exchange will happen when X promises B that payment in the form of
DCNs' will take place upon the transfer of goods/ completion of services from B.
Once B has fulfilled their obligation, a request by B will be made and the smart
contract will carry out the request by means of transferring DCNs from Xs' account
into B's account. History of all transfers will be stored in the ledgers of both parties
and the balance for each account will be present in the contract state. Users may
request to send tokens from their wallet to any Ethereum wallet through smart
contract.
Smart  Contract
Ethereum allows the running of decentralized code in conjunction with smart
contracts, enabling reliable services and payments handling. ‘Smart Contracts are a
central component of next- generation blockchain platforms.’5 Due to the contracts'
self-executing nature, single party manipulation is averted because control over the
execution of the smart contract does not fall into the hands of a single party. Hence,
it could be said that smart contracts provide autonomy, trust, speed, and safety.

Dentacoin smart contracts are computer protocols in the Ethereum blockchain that
facilitate, verify, negotiate and conclude contracts between individuals and their
contracting party. More information on the smart contract code will be provided later
on in the whitepaper.
Due to these smart contracts holding value, as mentioned earlier in this whitepaper,
individuals may participate or audit all Dentacoins' smart contracts on Github.
All smart contracts are connected to one "super smart contract"(SSC) but don't lose
their individual rights. If a smart contract cannot be fulfilled due to performance
impossibility (death), then the SSC saves the patients' rights!
Thanks to the trustworthy nature of smart contracts, many of the industry problems
can be mitigated or extinguished.
Dentacoin ERC20 Standard token contract
The core contract is an extended version of the Standard Ethereum token contract
(ERC20). You can explore and prove it on https://etherscan.io.
Token Contract extensions
   Automated transaction fee handling
Dentacoin owners need not worry about transaction fees (gas) in ether. It is not
necessary for Dentacoin holders to hold any ether in order to send and receive DCN
due to the fact that all fees are automatically deducted from the receiving amount (in
DCN) that is received by the receiver.
18




This transfer function due to the upcoming Metropolis Ethereum hard fork might be
updated to handle token fees internally.
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
if (_value < DCNForGas) throw;
if (msg.sender != owner && _to == DentacoinAddress && directTradeAllowed) {

return true;
}
if (balances[msg.sender] >= _value && balances[_to] + _value > balances[_to]) {

Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
return true;

   A Buy-and-Sell function for Presale, ICO and future Crowd Investing
Dentacoin implemented two additional functions that allow sending DCN or ETH to
the token address or dentacoin.eth in order to easily sell and buy Dentacoin (DCN)
to/from the Foundation.

Allocation and supply
There are two ways people can get involved with a crypto-currency:
1) Purchase the cryptocurrency.
2) Earn via work.
In both cases, users are increasing the value of the currency.
If people can earn money by working for one another then they will increase its value
through mutual exchange facilitated by a fair currency system -that is exactly the
model through which Dentacoin operates.
As a custom token and a solution, specially designed for the global dental Industry,
Dentacoin has a highly promising future.
As per the report from our partner clinic, which has already implemented the use of
DCN as means of payment, it is clear that the majority of the dental industry will
easily adopt this business model.
The unlock and potential distribution of 76.1% of the coins (6.088.888.888.888 DCN)

Fundamental Price
NB: For the calculations shown below5, the difference between fundamental value of
the Dentacoin Foundation and the market value of the Dentacoin Foundation must
be understood.
Both of them are expressed in either DCN or $ USD, but their meaning and worth for
investors and traders are indiviually very different.
The calculated fundamental value (real value) of the Foundation remains almost
unchanged throughout the development of Dentacoin, since it is bound to the size of
the community and the value per user within the community.
The market value can undergo typical market fluctuations and depends mostly on the
demand for DCN.
Respectively the calculated fundamental price has no influence on the market price
(trading price).
The market price per DCN is expected to exceed the real value over time. For further
information please read the next chapter: Market Development Steps.
Table comparison: Calculated fundamental value of DCN compared
to the planned ICO price of DCN (Oct. 2017)
Calculated fundamental value of the                                                                    Planned price of DCN
Dentacoin foundation per DCN                                                                           during the ICO in October 2017
$ 0,00452                                                                                              $ 0.00011723 (85,3 DCN per USD cent)
From the numbers above it can be seen that the fundamental value of the Dentacoin
blockchain concept is 3756.65% higher than its planned ICO price. The value of the
DCN is a calculated fundamental value for the Dentacoin blockchain concept on the
basis of its business plan.

Estimated value per Dentacoin user
Businesses that do not put their focus on trading but on the creating of user
communities are usually valued by the amount of users, they have on their platform.
Facebook's market cap, for example, is valued at $450 billion. That equals $225 of
value per facebook user.
The team of Dentacoin has worked intensively on the question, what is the value per
user of the Dentacoin's blockchain. By looking at only one tool of the Dentacoin
concept, namely the insurance concept, it was seen that the value per user was higher
than those of facebook. Since we are only at the beginning of the development of all
our tools and projects we used a cautious value of only $60 per user. We therefore
used the highest possible risk factors.

Market Development Steps
1. Short-term (5 years): First 3 global campaigns are to generate 0.1% of the target
market share.
2. Medium-term (10 years): Reaching 1% of the target market through the developed
Health Database, Dentacoin Insurance, and Trading Platform.
3. Long-term (25 years): In the planned rollout period 10% of the target market share
will be reached.
The calculation of the future value is based on the number of Dentacoin wallets
created. Within the first 3 stages of its development, Dentacoin Foundation aims to
achieve a market share of 10%. In the global dental industry, this 10% market share
means 600 million patients and 200 000 dentists (12.5% of all dentists), using the
Dentacoin value-creating tools. 10% of the market share, with a corresponding rate of
USD 60 per patient and USD 600 per dentist, a company value of approximately USD
36.12 billion is generated. (USD 3.6 billion per 1% market share).
26




Funding
Funds raised during the ICO will be used solely for the development of the Dentacoin
network. The following distribution of funds is preliminary and can be subject to
change.
   Core Development - 40%
Core development will involve the development of the technology as described in
this document. This includes the integration of VPN protocols, smart contract
systems, supporting of security protocols and services, end user applications... etc.
   Operational - 25%
This covers the necessary costs incurred for a functional system. This includes hosting
and infrastructure costs, staffing, outsourcing, management and other related
expenses.
   Marketing and Sales - 25% 
Marketing costs will be used for partnership development and direct consumer
marketing. Sales costs will largely be incurred through direct B2B sales.
   Legal and Compliance - 10%
There are legal costs associated with privacy protection and registrations with
regulators. The legal costs might vary from region to region.

Reward  Models
“In the future, more and more things we do (passive or active) are going to get
compensated by a token of some sort. In the same way today governments are issuing
money, in the future companies will be issuing tokens to marry that value to a function
that they have, or a product of their specific offering.”, William Mougayar at Ethereal
Summit 2017.
Individuals should be compensated for both business works completed and effort
and time used when providing businesses with valuable reviews and feedback (due to
the fact that reviews and client feedback can possess extremely vital information that
businesses will utilize to their benefit).
As William Mougayar (@wmougayar), the author of The Business Blockchain said
during the Ethereal Summit 2017, “We all have 3 jobs today: the job that we get paid
to do at an office; the 2nd job is taking care of ourselves and our family and household,
and the 3rd job has been given to us by another company for using their services -
renting a car for example. All kinds of jobs have been given to us, without us getting
compensated (paid) for them.”
This is not a new concept. The token economy is a reward system used to reward
target behaviour. Many schools and kindergartens work with some sort of rewards
(tokens, stickers or another form of points) to encourage positive behaviour in
children. Tokens are also applied in all sorts of games, where players receive a reward
upon achieving a certain stage, marked as a target by the game creator. A token
economy can be seen in every workplace whereby each person who goes to work
gets rewarded upon achieving the goals that are set by the business, and in return,
they get paid. More often the payment is in the form of fiat currency, such as euro,
dollars, etc. There are often additional rewards, in the form of lunch allowances, gym
memberships, travel costs and paid annual leave. This also adds up to the
remuneration that people receive by going to work. Individuals are all very much
aware of the token economy and are active participants within it.
People should get paid in different currencies (tokens) depending on how much
value they have added to each company. Which makes all individuals collaborators of
a company, without having a civil contract. People can have 10 different jobs where
they dedicate different amounts of their time, so it is only fair to get paid for each
hour of the time that is given to a business. Thus, no individual will have to depend
on a single employer, but rather on many different employers, who benefit from the
time and effort people dedicated to their business.
The Dentacoin Token was created to help the Dentacoin Foundation improve the
dental Industry globally, by giving power to the people (In this case- the patients).
Review input from community members is critical for Dentacoin to accurately allocate
payments to contributors. Reviews and dental practice registrations can, therefore be
viewed as a crucial contribution and worthy of a reward on its own. Some platforms,
28




such as Slashdot, use meta-moderation as a way to rank and reward honest
moderators. Dentacoin chooses to reward those who contribute to trusted reviews,
dental practice registrations and valuable feedback content for the industry. The
rewards are directly connected to the level of participation.
A detailed explanation of how the rewarding system will work and how many DCNs
will be distributed for each action that benefits the community will be added via a
table or chart.

Conclusion
In conclusion, an industry specific cryptocurrency (such as Dentacoin) could
significantly reduce the industry specific costs, lead to economies of scale and
provide quality services to people from lower income groups. As more and more
people earn Dentacoin (DCN) and use them in various ways, the value of the
cryptocurrency will rise, giving more freedom to the community.
Indeed, the idea behind Dentacoin is revolutionary but it is also inevitable. There is an
obvious solution to the problems of various industries and it’s just a matter of time
until communities implement DCN and reap the benefits thereof.
