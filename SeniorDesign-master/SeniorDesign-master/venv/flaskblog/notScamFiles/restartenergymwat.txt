Restart Energy is building a global energy supply platform using blockchain protocol to democratize a sector
burdened by bureaucracy and transaction costs, freeing up capital, saving consumers money, helping local
small producers earn more and allowing real peer to peer direct energy trading using existing infrastructure.
Energy demand globally is expected to nearly double by 2030.   With finite resources and the commitment to
the  UN  SDGs,  nations  must  innovate  to  generate  power  in  a  socially,  economically,  and  environmentally
sustainable manner. The European Union Member States and the United States have begun piloting reforms
through energy market deregulation, allowing private companies to operate in the power retail sector. Countries
across Asia such as fapan, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Singapore have opted for
market deregulation in a bid to create sustainability while China and India are slated to follow from 2018.

Our vision
We  envision  a  vibrant,  sustainable  world  where  affordable  energy  is  created  and  consumed  by  anyone
anywhere.
Our mission
Our mission is to become the leading global energy supplier, innovating and democratizing the sector.
Our goals
Restart Energy is committed to achieving the following goals:
§    Raise 30 million USD, in order to finish RED development and expand globally
§    Expand energy retail business by franchising to more than  45 countries with deregulated markets,
representing 70 percent of the worldgs energy consumption through 2022
Restart Energy Democracy Platform (RED-P)
RED-P is a software platform for global decentralized energy supply.
Consumers and producers register to use the RED-P to gain access to 1) global energy supply; 2) intelligent
wifi meters; 3) watt prediction software; 4) peer-to-peer (P2P) energy exchange; 5) potential to earn green
certificates.
Innovative features of RED-P include:
§    Any registered user can buy or sell from any other registered user
§    Some consumers are also generators (e.g. windhsolar) as large power stations (gas, coal, nuclear) are
being replaced with thousands of consumer-generators (prosumers).
§    P2P: All parties in our ecosystem are able to trade directly with each other.
§    Consumers will be awarded with RED-standard green certificates for using renewable energy.
With the new platform, we anticipate energy companies to adapt to the new economy. Energy companies will
start to take payment of energy bills in tokens as there will be a market for those tokens.
Finally, RED-P will increase competition in the electricity market. For instance, with our model, consumers will
be able to iauto-switchi their energy supplier every 30 days. The system will tender consumer contracts every
30 days seamlessly, ensuring a more competitive marketplace and truly market-reflective prices.
RED MegaWatt Token's Utility (MWAT)
The RED MegaWatt (MWAT) Tokens are ERC20 utility tokens that give access to the RED Platform Software
and to the RED Franchise. The RED Platform is a blockchain based decentralized energy trading platform that
makes it possible for energy consumers, prosumers, and producers to send and receive energy, worldwide. The
tokenized  energy  traded  on  the  RED  Platform  can  be  physically  delivered  at  local  rates  in  countries  with
deregulated energy markets where Restart Energy will be present directly or through its franchises. The RED
Franchise is the first power retail franchise that makes it simple and easy to start and operate your own power

MWAT is the first token backed by real opportunity. Each MWAT allows users to buy or sell up to 1,000 KW
Tokens per month, on the RED Platform Software.KW tokens (KWT) are tradable exclusively on the platform
and can hold a virtual energy charge.

Here at Restart Energy we believe in giving back to the community and as such, we have devised the RED
Loyalty System; through which producers transfer platform-exclusive KWT to MWAT holders for registering and
keeping MWAT tokens on the RED-Platform.
Through the RED Loyalty System, energy producers shall provide each MWAT that registers on the platform
with an initial and one-time charge of 0.11 KWT, once registration is complete.
More in-depth details about token mechanics can be found on page 63.

Introducing the RED Franchise
Be the first to secure your retail energy franchise in your country and resell it to other private suppliers or
companies after the Token Generation Event (TGE).
As we move forward, and as we have already successfully done in the past, we will focus our efforts on growing
our franchise network - this time on a global scale. Every franchise needs to own a certain number of MWAT
tokens to operate - this is not a payment to Restart Energy; full functionality for MWAT tokens applies.
If  yougre  interested  in  entering  the  energy  sector,  then  Restart  Energygs  franchise  program  is  a  unieue
opportunity to become personally involved in our mission to re-invent the way energy is bought, sold, and
traded globally - through the RED ecosystem - a global, privatized, decentralized energy supply platform.
What is the RED Franchise?
The RED Franchise  (RED-F) is an exclusive business opportunity available to MWAT Token holders. It is an
innovative, tested, and working idea that is already being used within the European Union. By allowing MWAT
holders  to  create  and  run  their  own  energy  retail  business,  we  are  merging  decentralization  blockchain
technology with free market principles.
RED Franchise Types & Tiers

retail company, and the franchisee would be the one to enter into a new market and establish his business.
The franchisee would take on all risk and expenses to create a market, and Restart Energy would provide
technical, infrastructural, process automation, marketing  and  sales support. The franchisee  would  need  to
provide the financial and management capacity for setting up his power retail company.

* Restart Energy reserves the right to lower the reeuired amount of tokens franchises need to hold, if the
percentage of MWAT locked in franchise accounts becomes too high and hampers smooth platform operations.
Type B - Reseller / Broker
Only Master Franchise tier is exclusive.
Restart Energy would be the one to enter into a new market and establish the company. The company would
take on all risks and expenses to create a market, and the franchise owner would simply act as a retailer or
broker with our full support.
Master Franchise owner would receive:
Right to create and sell sub-franchises
Part of revenues from all sub-franchises
A comprehensive franchise kit, detailing all relevant information for the target market, modeled after our
already successful franchise kits provided to European partners.
Training for all staff and employees
Marketing and Branding
Local Promotion for the months leading up to and after the launch, paid for by Restart Energy to promote
the RED ecosystem and franchise business
Access to the Agent Module, offering the ability to add new franchises, see energy consumption and manage
clients
Access to the Front Desk Module of RED CRM
Access to Restart Energy management, from where we can assist and fully support the franchise and its
owners

!




As a Master Tier resellerhbroker, you would be entitled to a percentage of all revenues made by all other
franchises in the target country (typically 10%),plus the revenues generated from direct sales, in the form
of signing premium plus passive consumption commission.
Pros: Very low risk, Restart Energy takes on cost of expansion
Cons: Lower margin compared to full franchise ownership
Type B Franchise Tiers
Owning a certain number of MWAT grants holders access to one of four Type B Franchise tiers and to the
income from reselling energy contracts. It is important to note that it is only reeuired that a franchise owner
hold a certain amount of tokens. It is not a form of payment to Restart Energy.
10,000 MWAT -                                                                                                             RED City Franchise -Allows the token holder to broker energy sales in their city of
choice, within their country of residence. Multiple city franchises can operate within the same city and will be
coordinated by Restart Energy or the Type A Franchise that operates within that country.
100,000 MWAT                                                                                                              -                                                                                     RED Regional Franchise - Allows the token holder to broker energy sales in an entire
region of their country of residence. Same as with City Franchises, multiple regional franchises can coexist.
1,000,000 MWAT                                                                                                            -                                                                                     Red Country Franchise - Allows token holders to sell energy in their entire
country of residence. As per the previous tiers, multiple country franchises can coexist.
+10,000,000 MWAT                                                                                                          -                                                                                     RED Master Franchise  - Gives the token holders exclusive rights to their
country of residence and the option to create sub-franchises inside it - meaning there can only be one Master
Franchise per country. The amount is dependent on the countrygs population.
Type B franchises reeuire either a Type A franchise or Restart Energy itself present in the country in order to
resell their energy supply packages.
Type C Franchise
This is a franchise especially designed for companies that want to develop renewable energy promects and
services,  where  RED  offers  access  to  its  RED  Platform  engineering  support  and  a  business  plan  for  the
development  of  renewable  energy  systems  in  countries  or  states  that  support  green  energy.  The  token
reeuirement for a Type C franchise is the same as that for a Type B Master Franchise.
Type C Franchises will have access to the RED Decentralized Marketplace for selling their renewable energy
products and services to RED users globally and to the RED Crowdfunding Module for financing their new
renewable developments on the blockchain.
Existing Franchise Partners
As mentioned above, Restart Energy is already using the Franchise model proposed in our Whitepaper. A big
part of the companygs success to date has been based on its ability to successfully develop a multi-channel
sales  strategy,  by  euickly  identifying  market  opportunities  and  leveraging  local  resources,  such  as  micro-
entrepreneurs, through the first retail energy franchise in the European Union.

The success of a franchise owner is our success as well. We work hard to ensure all franchises are fully
supported via multiple sales channels for energy retail. As an example, in Romania, we are leveraging multiple
sales channels for the supply of energy and gas with the following efforts:
1. Local distribution partners who aceuire a franchise and sell energy to their longstanding customers. This
strategy has proven very successful so far and will be a mamor contribution to our global expansion plans.
2. Formation of local D2D teams around our best local franchise partners.( +200 D2D agents employed by
franchiseegs)
3. Our own sales force that currently includes:  1 National Sales Manager,  1 Logistics Manager,  8-person
Contracting Department, 7 Regional Sales Managers, 70 D2D sales agents (commission-based).
4. Partnerships with national companies like Euro GSM  (largest ORANGE telecom dealer), Inter Broker
(3rd  largest  insurance  broker),  GRS                                                                           (largest  auto  insurance  broker),  Cashback  World  (largest  cash-back
shopping  network),  Romanian  Post  (5000+  country  locations),  TVSat  (largest  regional  media  j  telecom

3  THE !CHALLENGE !
!
Despite the deregulation of energy markets, several challenges prevent market entry for private electricity
suppliers.   With legacy players continuing to hold the mamority share of the market, little has changed since the
deregulation.
Obstacles  to  entering  the  household  and  SME  energy  markets  include  capital-intensive  infrastructure  and
process automation necessary to handle large numbers of low volume consumption orders. Current service
models do not provide direct connection between producers of renewable energy to consumers, resulting in the
inability  to  profit  and  grow  business,  save,  and  choose  between  renewable  and  fossil  fuels.  Government
subsidies for renewable energy are designed to mumpstart markets until the necessary economies of scale for
grid parity are reached, but in reality, there are very few countries where renewable energy has reached grid
parity.
Now, after the drop in subsidies, the world is looking for a new distributed energy development model to directly
connect end users to producers to allow consumers direct access to accountable, cheaper energy, while also
providing producers with increased incentives for faster renewable energy deployment around the world. Small
consumers and producers are usually trapped in contracts with suppliers that provide limited services at high
costs  for  the  end  users.  Currently,  the  limited  blockchain  energy  schemes  have  focused  on  incentivizing
renewable energy generation. This model does not solve the main issues in the market raised above.
3.1    Our Solution
Restart Energy Democracy (RED): The first global online energy provider.
Restart Energy is developing a blockchain-based platform with a single, intuitive user interface allowing for
global energy supply that will help it become the next generation utility company.
More than 3 billion energy consumers all over the world in deregulating markets will be able to switch their
current energy provider with Restart Energy or a RED Franchise in an online, transparent environment using
our platform, in less than 5 minutes. The platform will provide for all of their energy needs in a superior user-
friendly way for real time consumption, invoices, payments and, most importantly, it will allow for direct peer
to peer energy associated rights exchanged between consumers, prosumers and producers of any kind.
The Restart Energy Democracy Platform (RED) connects energy producers and traders with retail customers
around the globe in a transparent, decentralized manner; creating added value for all the parties by employing
blockchain to remove several layers of costs associated with bureaucracy and transaction costs.
By rearranging the way transactions are settled, in a transparent manner using blockchain, producers will be
able to sell their energy at a price 30% higher compared to the wholesale price to high numbers of low-volume
retail  customers,  who  will  then  pay                                                                                30%  less  using  existing  grid  infrastructure  and  the  RED  platform
administered by Restart Energy.

!




Furthermore, we intend to develop a new standard of cryptographic green certificates, using blockchain that
will be awarded to the consumers of renewable energy. The green certificates will store information about the
source of energy, the producer, the consumerhuser and the owner of the certificates. We believe that by creating
a transparent and accountable standard of user-owned cryptographic green certificates, tradable on secondary
markets, we incentivize the consumption of green energy and thus demand for renewable power sources
through free market principles - this, in turn, increases the rate of adoption of renewables and ultimately leads
to increased revenues for green energy producers and a more sustainable energy future for everyone.
Fig. h Current market roles
3.2    How Electricity is Traded Now
At present, electricity is traded through exchanges or over-the-counter transactions (OTC). In many markets,
more than 75% of the electricity volume is traded over the counter. As a result, bids and offers are managed
by financial brokers, and therefore, are often executed outside of exchanges. This, in turn, reduces the visibility
and transparency of the transactions. In addition, the centralized model of trading with a small number of large-
scale energy companies dominating the market further limits improvements toward visibility and transparency
of trades.
The global trends and latest technologies in renewable energy generation has enabled individual consumers to
generate energy on their own and this has pushed the energy markets toward decentralization. In addition,
29!
!




improvements  in  the  battery  technologies  have  enabled  efficient  storage  of  energy,  providing  more
opportunities for consumers to become independent in their energy management.
In conclusion, the current transaction model remains a barrier to trade: consumers must still use the traditional
methods to purchase and sell their excess energy reeuirements from their own generation.
3.3    Current System
1)   Consumer: takes energy from the grid; pays retail price for energy; usually cannot choose his energy
source; low accountability; low incentive to invest in renewable energy.
2)   Prosumer: a consumer that also produces energy; a prosumer produces more energy with solar than
needed, so sells some back to the grid at a very low price - low because these small euantities are very
difficult to forecast, and legacy energy providers have no incentives to offer such services because their
own supply and revenue from consumers would be reduced.
3)   Producer:  inmects  energy  into  the  grid;  gets  wholesale  price  for  the  energy;  very  low  return  on
investment means low incentive to invest without subsidies.
3.4    New System: Restart Energy Democracy Platform (RED-P)
RED-P is a global, decentralized energy supply platform software.
Consumers and producers register to use the RED-P to gain access to 1) global energy supply; 2) intelligent
WiFi meters; 3) watt prediction software; 4) peer-to-peer (P2P) energy exchange; 5) potential to earn green
certificates.
Innovative features of RED-P include:
§    Any registered user can buy or sell from any other registered user
§    Some consumers are also generators (e.g. windhsolar) as large power stations (gas, coal, nuclear) are
being replaced with thousands of consumer-generators (prosumers).
§    P2P: All parties in our ecosystem are able to trade directly with each other.
With the new platform, we anticipate energy companies to adapt to the new economy. Energy companies will
start to take payment of energy bills in tokens as there will be a market for those tokens and a value associated
with them. Blockchain is appealing to energy companies as it will allow the energy companies to address the
administrative  burden  of  connecting  to  retail  market  consumers,  energy  producers,  balancing  responsible
parties and other bodies through the blockchain. It would also automate payments daily or weekly, with lower
levels of debt.
Finally, RED-P will increase competition in the electricity market. For instance, with our model, consumers will
be able to iauto-switchi their energy supplier every 30 days. The system will tender consumer contracts every
30 days seamlessly, ensuring a more competitive marketplace and truly market-reflective prices.
MWAT holders purchasing energy from the RED platform will also receive 1 Green Certificate for each 1 MWh
of green energy consumed. The green certificates will be automatically allocated to their respective consumer
accounts and will help in accounting for how much green energy they have consumed.
30!
!




A secondary platform for green certificates will be developed on the RED platform where companies that want
to support renewable energy production and help the planet end fossil fuel pollution may purchase the green
certificates from the consumers according to free-market principles. The companies will be able to use the
purchased green certificates globally to reduce their carbon footprint and prove their green credentials in a
transparent manner.
Each green certificate on blockchain will contain information of the production source, issue date and will allow
the general public to track ownership.
These green certificates represent an additional income source for the owners and incentivize the Consumers
to use the RED platform for purchasing green energy.
3.h    Size of the Market
By  2016, the worldwide electricity consumption reached  21,190 TWh  (Terawatt hours). Asia and Americas
accounted for 43% and 27% of the total respectively.   Of the Asian consumption, China accounted for 58%
while  India  accounted  for  12%.  In  other  words,  China  has  consumed  approximately  25%  of  the  worldgs
electricity in 2016.
The global power market is currently worth around 2 trillion USD per annum.
The extent of deregulation of energy trading largely varies according to the countryhterritory, however, the
mamority of the worldgs largest energy markets are already deregulated, and some others are moving towards
deregulation. Most of the Middle East and Africa markets remain highly regulated though, which account for
around 8% of the global consumption.
Further, it is important to note that China has recently announced1 its plan of deregulating its 500 billion USD
electricity market in must a few yearsp time.
3.i    Energy Markets Regulations
§                                                                                                                   35 countries in the world accounting for 44 percent of the worldgs energy consumption have already
embraced deregulated energy markets and many other markets will follow
§    fapan recently deregulated its energy market because power became substantially more expensive
after Fukushima and citizens no longer trusted the energy monopolies, making the idea of open markets
more appealing
§    India is experimenting with deregulated energy markets

A deregulated electricity market would generally allow the market forces (demand and supply) to determine
the price while providing opportunities for the private sector to participate in the market. Similarly, the European
Union  is  also  in  the  process  of  creating  a  unified  market  across  its  member  countrieshterritories  with  the
obmective of creating an integrated energy ecosystem that will increase the efficiency of the market, allowing
cheaper energy prices for its people in a more sustainable and manageable energy network. However, the
extent of the deregulation can vary according to the country.
At present, Western and Northern European markets are already deregulated to a great extent, while Southern
and Eastern European markets are less deregulated.
The United States usually have a highly deregulated market but not all states have separated the retail from
the  distribution  operator;  Canada  also  has  deregulated  markets  with  Alberta  and  Ontario  being  the  most
deregulated  provinces.  In  Oceania,  both  Australia  and  New  nealand  have  highly  deregulated  markets  in
electricity with active involvement of the private sector.
Countries across Asia such as fapan, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Singapore have
opted for market deregulation in a bid to create sustainability.
fapan is aiming for a complete deregulation of its retail market by  2017 with reforms in electricity and gas
markets. The Fukushima event was the main driver of the energy policy being revisited.
fapan initiated its electricity market deregulation process last year April and it is steadily becoming one of the
worldgs largest deregulated electricity markets. If successful, the change could result in a vastly modernized
energy sector resulting in lower rates and a more prosperous economy overall. The deregulation could see
fapan advance innovation and even become a model for the Asian region.
Malaysia has introduced deregulation to its gas and power sector and has paved the way for the introduction
of Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to the supply function of the sector, helping the government to reduce
the costs and administration involved in the exploration of new natural gas fields.
Thailand, as a part of International Monetary Fund and World Bank recommendations, unbundled the Electricity
Generating Authority  (EGAT) assets and introduced laws for market deregulation. Since  2010, it offers new
financial products that target huge market capitalization.
The Philippinesgs Energy Regulatory Commission facilitated the privatization of the National Power Corporation
which worked very well in the urban centers, with fully liberated markets benefitting urban consumers. However,
providing services to rural markets competitively remains a challenge.
The national electricity market of Singapore, under the supervision of the Electricity Market Authority (EMA),
facilitates the competitive sale of electricity to wholesale and retail markets. It introduced large consumers to
the retail electricity industry with contestability reaching 45% by 2010 with a view of to eventually achieving
100% by 2020.
Pollution and overcapacity is Chinags reason for market deregulation. Pollution is a mamor driving force behind
Chinags reform as cheap coal and overcapacity encourage wasteful consumption patterns. This stands in the
way of the governmentgs efforts to improve energy efficiency and cut pollution.
Chinags large scale investments in wind and solar energy are being under-used within the current system, which
is too static to effectively incorporate fluctuating green energy generation rates, resulting in waste and the
threat of power cuts.
32!
!




The  country  is  a  big  energy  consumer,  representing  25%  of  the  worldgs  energy  consumption.  Electricity
distribution and transmission are critical to Chinags growing economy.
The electricity reforms began with a pilot promect in Shenzhen, in  2014, and where expanded to five more
regions in 2015, with enterprises seeing savings of 854.6 million USD as result. Similarly, direct energy sales
were expanded to seven more cities in  2015. The government is set to expand the program to ten more
provincials,  and  one  to  two  regional  power  grids  in                                                            2016  (including  Beiming,  Tianmin,  Chongeing,  and
Guangdong), and the whole country by  2017. The government will be monitoring the progress of the pilot
promect until 2018.
The regulator aims to complete the revamp of transmission and distribution tariffs by the end of this year, and
will start trial spot market power trading by the end of 2018 and fully operate it in 2020. It also aims to complete
work related to the opening of the retail market to new players after state-run monopolies are fragmented.
By shifting to a deregulated market, the government wants to use market forces to phase out inefficient and
less environmentally friendly producers out of the market.
With the market setting prices at various bidding increments, efficient producers will now be given the chance
to properly use their assets, under-bidding less competitive producers. As a result, Chinags ageing and idirtyi
generators will be forced to operate at peak consumption hours, thereby reducing pollution levels.
Although the world is moving towards deregulation, most of the markets have not yet seen an efficient and
effective competition as these markets are still dominated by a small number of large companies. In fact, this
issue  has  been  identified  by  most  regulators  who  are  actively  encouraging  the  new  market  entrants  and
especially new technologies to transform the market and its operation, leading to a higher level of competition
and transparency benefiting the consumers.

4  THE !PROBLEM !IN !DETAIL !
!
4.1    Monopolistic Players
Legacy, vertically integrated players still hold mamority shares of the deregulated energy market in the world,
which  has  often  created  monopolistic  behaviors  leading  to  poor  customer  service  and  unreasonable  and
arbitrary pricing. With limited transparency between the producers and consumers, market inefficiencies are
often transferred to small renewable energy producers and end customers.
Vertical integration  is  a  model common  to  many  European  energy  markets. In  theory,  vertical integration
delivers efficiencies and reduces costs to the company. The nature of electricity generation assets, which are
expensive to build and have a long life, makes vertical integration an attractive structure for companies to help
reduce future risks. This is because the electricity generator will always have a buyer for some or all of its
output  at  a  price  that  the  generator  determines.  This  provides  a  high-level  hedge  for  fluctuating  relative
profitability across the wholesale and retail sides of the electricity market. Vertically integrated companies can
also avoid credit and collateral costs. But as well as helping manage risk, vertical integration is a business model
that inherently lacks transparency. The different divisions or businesses - electricity generation, gas production,
energy retail  - can be sister businesses or divisions within the same company. While there will be separate
management for each business division, these all fall within the management of a single group board. As a
result, it is impossible to see the dynamic or relationship between the different business divisions. For example,
to what extent is one business arm exerting pressure on the otherk The dynamics between the different divisions
will affect the price consumers pay and may differ between companies.
In addition, monopolistic behaviors can affect the consumers negatively as follows:
§    Monopolies restrict output onto the market to exploit its dominant position over a period, or to drive up
the price.
§    There is asymmetric information. The monopolist may know more than the consumer and it can exploit
this knowledge to its own advantage.
§    Monopolies have no incentive to reduce average costs to a minimum.
§    Monopolies can create barriers to entry for new entrants due to high startup capital costs and economies
of scale with their high volumes.
4.2    Inefficient Operating Environment and Trading Platforms
The nature of electricity adds complexity to the wholesale electricity market. This is because electricity is unlike
other commodities. It is impossible to trace electricity from a particular generator to a particular customer and
electricity is rarely stored (storage is very expensive and where it does occur tends to be in the form of hydro).
In addition, there are very tight physical parameters, such as freeuency and voltage, that must be maintained
when it is transported via the grid system that reeuires second by second management across the system. The
energy trading in most countries is highly regulated, technical, and capital intensive. For instance, during the
trading process on day-ahead markets, electricity producers who want to sell power to the spot market must
send their sale offers (for the amount of electricity they are prepared to deliver at various prices during the 24
hours of the following day) to the power exchange by noon on the day before the power is delivered to the
grid. This may lead to the reliance on erratic pricing in the energy trading by energy providers.
34!
!




Therefore, there are many problems in retail electricity and gas supply today:
    The current energy-trading environment has limited the access to a few, specialized wholesale energy
traders. On the other hand, it does not create any direct connection between energy producers and
energy consumers, limiting the potential transparency between the parties.!
    Market entry for the household and SME consumer segment for private electricity suppliers is currently
not viable because of the expensive infrastructure and process automation necessary to handle a large
number   of   consumption   places   and   the   long   pay-back   periods   behind   the   low   volumes.
!
    Hectic, complicated tariffs systems are confusing for the final customers.!
5  DETAILS !OF !THE !SOLUTION !
!
h.1    Amazon of Energy
How will this work?
The Restart Energy Democracy Platform connects energy producers and traders with retail customers around
the globe in a transparent, decentralized manner that creates value for all the parties by employing a) blockchain
to remove several layers of costs associated with bureaucracy and transactions costs and b) a decentralized
supply service to end customers. The inherent structure of the system is designed for fast scalability and global
applicability in all deregulated energy markets using the same proven methods that helped the company to
achieve its fast growth in EU market.
Producers will be able to sell their energy at a price 30% higher compared to the wholesale price due to high
numbers of low volume retail customers that in turn will pay  30% less using existing grid infrastructure by
rearranging the way transactions are settled in a transparent manner using blockchain.
Energy virtually sold by producers to consumers on the RED Platform is tokenized and delivered worldwide. The
RED Platform software automatically matches the value of internal KW Tokens depending on local energy rates.
Energy supply as a service
Existing private energy providers and energy producers in deregulated markets will have to purchase MWAT
Tokens to gain access to the RED-P and will benefit from the process automation and retail customer base with
better margins without associated transaction capital costs and zero risks.
Electricity and gas consumers and producers accessing RED-P will be represented by Restart Energy when
switching energy providers, payments, and other related services. At the same time, Restart Energy will sign
contracts with local electricity and gas suppliers for providing the energy supply as a service, sales, marketing,
IT and process automation infrastructure to supply to large numbers of low volume consumers.

h.2    Restart Energy Democracy Platform (RED-P)
The global Restart Energy Democracy platform (RED-P)software allows consumers and producers to register
and change supplier, compare tariffs, see consumptions and pay invoices with cryptocurrency and tokens. The
platform empowers users to buy, sell and trade energy among each other - worldwide.
Restart Energy, provides the sales, marketing and other infrastructure including invoicing systems and process
automation systems necessary for supplying energy to a large number of consumers to local private energy
providers around the world while receiving a fee per unit of consumption as its revenue.
RED-P provides transparency and improves efficiency throughout the value chain under its control. It uses
several innovative systems and processes, including web and mobile apps, wireless metering and effortless
online switching of suppliers with superior customer service and zero bureaucracy, enabling consumers to
effectively aceuire and manage their energy needs and achieve savings.
Restart Energy uses the blockchain technology as the basis of this platform to apply its inherent nature of
transparency, decentralization, and security.
The model is one that works in a global context and will be implemented across all power markets, which are
becoming increasingly deregulated. The Chinese power market, which has always been closed is also opening
a 500 billion USD market in 2020.

h.3    Decentralized Energy Trading Platform
Restart Energy is setting up a decentralized energy trading platform (RED-P) based on blockchain technology,
which will enable anyone to trade energy using the tokens or fiat currencies in any deregulated energy market
in the world. This will revolutionize the way people purchase their energy needs and the way energy producers
sell their production.
The proposed platform in its very nature will provide the following benefits:
§    Power to the people: everyone will be able to register, buy, sell, consume and trade energy through
MWAT on the crypto-energy trading platform !
§    Open an entire new market: facilitate and secure a transparent peer-to-peer exchange and contribute
to developing cryptocurrencies as a payment instrument increasing demand!
§    Restart Energy will also be able to provide delivery and offtake of purchased and sold energy!

The platform will work as a global integrated energy services platform for retail energy customers, energy
producers, and suppliers.
h.4    kirtual Balancing
Many TGEgs related to direct peer to peer energy exchange seem to lack the knowledge of how these transfers
can be physically executed and accounted for considering that any kind of energy exchange needs to pass
through the existing grid and reeuires accounting and balancing responsibility. The key to being able to provide
direct energy exchanges between consumers and producers is closely related to the way the energy systems
are balanced by the transport network operators (TSO).
One of the main features of the RED-P is that it will provide virtual balancing for suppliers, consumers and
producers in the same country  (group) and assign balancing responsibility between the parties so that they
may exchange energy among them that will be accounted in the final settlements without affecting the total
euantities of energy inside the same balancing group.
In other words, if Consumer A purchases energy directly from Producer B, the euantity of active energy that
was directly purchased will not appear in the monthly supply invoice. This system is only possible if all the
ingredients are present mainly real time energy metering and smart AI energy forecasting that can accurately
predict intermittent energy production and consumption coming from renewable sources.

WiFi Meters provide real time energy consumption/production
Restart  Energy  One  provides  its  customers  with  the  real  time  energy  consumption  viewing  service  on
restartenergy.ro web site or on the mobile phone app by downloading the Restart Energy App for Android or
IOS.
The specially developed Restart Energy WiFi smart meters have 0.1% precision class and are installed in the
general circuit board, without any changes to the existing meter, belonging to the distribution operator, they
send data regarding power euality and energy consumption in real time to Restart Energy servers. lou can see
this data in real time on the phonehpc. Thus, the user knows at any moment its energy consumption and cost,
as well as the instant active power. This is a great tool to increase public awareness about energy efficiency
and how much electric power home appliances use.
By monitoring and recording features related to the power euality distributed by the area distribution operator,
namely voltage and power variations, freeuency variations, harmonics, flickers, outages, Restart Energy servers
automatically send notifications to the customer and the distribution operator whenever there are deviations
from the Power Quality Standard.
Customers have access to various charts and data about the historical energy consumption and the consumption
profile.
Watt Predict Solar Energy Forecast Software
Watt Predict is an innovative AI learning software designed for
superior solar energy forecasting. It is a system that is able to
estimate electrical energy production for the next day.
Watt Predict!develops a software for a more precise estimation of
the euantity of energy produced by photovoltaic (PV) parks. Their
mission  is  reducing  costs  and  thus  significantly  decreasing  the
invoices  issued  by  institutions  responsible  for  imbalances  for
photovoltaic systems by providing a forecasting service with high
accuracy and financially accessibility.
Watt Predict!offers a new calculation method for forecasting the energy production from PV. In the forecast
solar radiation, the most difficult component is forecasting cloudy appearance spontaneous mainframe systems
and their evolution over time and space. To remove this drawback, it created and implemented:
§   a mathematical forecasting the appearance of clouds by detecting areas of convergence and areas of
frontier.
§   a soft radar information from previous measurements to identify and anticipate the movement of cloud
systems.
Developing and combining these two components, constitutes the novelty in terms of solar radiation forecast
by step timetable.
The promect received EU grants for research and is currently used in a research promect in partnership with the
European Space Agency.
Our application is based on numerical weather prediction, more specifically done with open-source WRF-ARW
regional weather prediction system initiated with GFS (Global Forecast System initial data and lateral boundary
conditions).  We  use  optimization  technieues  such  as  genetic  algorithms  in  order  to  better  represent  the
nebulosity (the main impediment in forecasting the incoming radiation).
42!
!




The energy produced by Solar PV parks is sold on energy markets 1 day in advance, thus a precise estimation
of the euantity of energy is of supreme importance for the producers.

6  INDUSTRY !ANALYSIS !
!
i.1    elobal Perspective
By 2016, the total worldwide electricity consumption reached 21,190 TWh (Terawatt hours), with 43% of the
consumption coming from Asia and 27% of the consumption coming from the Americas. China and India were
responsible for most of Asiags consumption: China at 58% and India at 12% respectively. In other words, China
alone accounted for approximately 25% of global electricity in 2016.
Global power market is worth around 2 trillion USD per annum. The deregulation of this market largely depends
on  countryhterritory.  Most  of  the  mamor  markets  are  either  already  deregulated  or  in  the  process  of
deregulating.   However, the Middle East and Africa still remain largely regulated. But these two regions make
up less than 8% of global electricity consumption. It is important to note that China has also recently announced
that it would be starting the process of deregulation of its huge 500 billion USD electricity market by 2018.
Using  power  source  as  a  metric  of  civilization,  world  energy  consumption  has  significant  implications  for
humanitygs socio-economic-political sphere3.   The worldgs primary energy supply amounted to 155,481 terawatt-
hours (TWh) or 13,541 Mtoe4 in 2014, while the final global energy consumption was 109,613 TWh or about
29.5% less than the total supply. World final energy consumption includes products such as lubricants, asphalt,
and  petrochemicals  which  have  chemical  energy  content  but  are  not  used  as  fuel.  This  non-energy  use
amounted to 9,404 TWh (809 Mtoe) in 2012.

According to the 2017 Global Energy Market Trends Report6 by Schneider Electric, the global energy landscape
is continuing to evolve. The level of complexity makes it increasingly difficult for organizations to anticipate and
react to the variables that will have the greatest impact on their business. Within those same companies, these
effects are likely to be felt across multiple departments across stakeholders around the world.
Renewable Energy Industry Outlook7
Throughout  2016, renewables effectively competed against fossil fuel generation in power markets and for
procurement  contracts  around  the  world.  It  is  clear  that  renewable  energy  resources  have  outgrown  the
ialternativei label.
Due  to  the  declining  costs  of  solar  and  wind  technologies  as  well  as  the  anticipation  of  a  more  carbon-
constrained future, today the global growth of renewable energy is increasingly driven by voluntary procurement
by utilities and corporations. We have seen an especially rapid decline in the global levelized cost of electricity
(LCOE)    of    solar    photovoltaic                                                                                       (PV)    generation    as    well    as    onshore    and    offshore    wind.
These improving economics are empowering many customers to seek greater control over their energy choices,
and a movement toward localized energy procurement seems to be underway. Wegre seeing many municipalities
across the world take advantage of community choice aggregation  (CCA) policies, and community solar has
taken off too. It is this strong demand from customers and communities that seem to have allowed renewables
to shed the ialternativei label and transition into mainstream resources.

i.2    Local Perspective
Romania is the largest oil and gas producer in Central and Eastern Europe8,9, but a net importer on both counts.
According to BPgs Statistical Review of World Energy (2016)10, Romaniags proved reserves at the end of 2015
were 100 million tons of oil (with a reserve to production ratio of 19.5) and 100 billion cubic meters (bcm) of
gas (with a reserve to production ratio of 10.4). Domestic gas production covered in excess of 95% (97.61%)
of total consumption in 2015.
The main sources of electricity generation in Romania (approximate percentages valid for 2015) are as follows:
Coal  27.63%;  Hydro  27.15%;  Nuclear  18.27%;  Gas  14.34%;  and  Renewable  sources  (other  than  Hydro)
12.51%. Although numerous facilities have been commissioned in the last five to seven years, only 12.51% of
the total electricity generated and dispatched into the grid in 2015 was produced by energy facilities other than
hydropower.   CEn owns the biggest onshore wind farm from the EU in Romania, the Fxntxnele-Cogealac wind
park, with a capacity of 600 MW.
The main electricity generation companies are state-owned: Nuclearelectrica, the operator of the only nuclear
power plant in Romania, having a capacity of 1,400 MW; Hidroelectricags system of hydropower plants; and
around  20  thermal  coal-fuelled  power  plants.   All  these  companies  together  generate  around  70%  of  the
countryps total electricity production.
According to data published by TSO Transelectrica, Romania produced 8.1 TWh of electricity from renewable
energy sources in 2015, a 3% increase from the previous year. Renewable energy thus accounted for 16% of
the 51.74 TWh used in 2015. According to the Energy Ministry, Romania has met its obmective of reaching a
total renewable energy of 24% for 2018; Romania has already reached 27%.
i.3    Competition
Current competitors of Restart Energy are the legacy energy suppliers owning distribution companies that also
are licensed to sell their electricity and natural gas. By April 25, 2017, there were 258 licensed companies for
supplying electric power andhor natural gas. Of them, 173 are registered for supplying electric power, 128 for
natural gas (43 companies are licensed for both services).11
There are eight mamor distribution and system operators (DSOs) for electric power, one per region, which
supplies to other regional distributors or companies. Some of them are state-owned while others are privately
owned. Below are the privately owned companies:
1.   Enel (https:hhwww.enel.ro): Enel is a global, vertically integrated energy company that manages and
upgrades the electricity networks in the three regions of Banat, Dobrogea and South Muntenia.
2.   CEm  (http:hhwww.cez.rohro): CEn is the Czech national energy company that owns one distribution
region in Romania.
3.   E.ON (https:hhwww.eon-energie-romania.roh): Eon is a German, vertically integrated energy company
that supplies natural gas and electricity in Romania.
4.   Electrica  (https:hhwww.electrica.roh): Electrica is a leader in the electricity distribution and supply
market in Romania, as well as one of the most important companies in the energy services sector.

7  WHY !BLOCKCHAIN !
A zpublic{ blockchain is a continuously growing public ledger of records that is an independent, decentralized,
verifiable, and permanent database coexisting in multiple locations shared by a community12. The records are
arranged in data batches called blocks that follow a cryptographic validation method. That means each block
references and identifies the previous block by a hashing function, forming an unbroken chain.
Functionally, a blockchain can serve as an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two
parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically
managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded,
the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subseeuent blocks and
a collusion of the network mamority, which is nearly impossible.
7.1    How Blockchain Works
There are three main components that need to be combined to create a zpublic{ blockchain. They are:
1.   Private key cryptography
2.   A distributed network with a shared ledger
3.   An incentive to service the network
Private gey cryptography
The main purpose of this component of blockchain technology is to create a secure digital identity reference.
Identity is based on possession of a combination of private and public cryptographic keys. Each party that
wishes to transact over the internet will hold a private key and a public key. The combination of these keys can
12https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain!

!




be  seen  as  a  dexterous  form  of  consent,  creating  extremely  useful  digital  signatures.  In  turn,  this  digital
signature provides strong control of ownership.
A distributed network with a shared ledger
A network of so-called computing inodesi is reeuired to maintain a blockchain. A node can be any computer
connected to the blockchain network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions.
A node gets a copy of the blockchain, which is downloaded automatically upon moining the blockchain network.
When cryptographic keys are combined with this network, a useful form of digital interactions emerges. The
process begins with one party broadcasting a block containing a digital signature, timestamp and relevant
information to all nodes in the network.
An incentive to service the network
The nodes in a blockchain offer computer-processing power to service the network. There is a reward available
for the nodes typically in cryptocurrency in exchange for their service.
Cryptocurrency units must be unieue to be owned and have value. To achieve this, the nodes serving the
network create and maintain a history of transactions for each currency unit by working to solve proof-of-work
mathematical problems and voting with their CPU power, expressing their agreement about new blocks or
remecting invalid blocks. This process is often called mining. When a mamority of the miners arrives at the same
solution, they add a new block to the chain. This block is time stamped and can also contain data or messages.
The type, amount and verification type can be different for each blockchain. It is a matter of the blockchaings
protocol - or rules for what is and is not a valid transaction or a valid creation of a new block. The process of
verification can be tailored for each blockchain. Any needed rules and incentives can be created when enough
nodes arrive at a consensus on how transactions ought to be verified.

7.2    Advantages of Blockchain Technology
Blockchain technology has the following inherent advantages.
Immutability: Nothing on the blockchain can be changed without the consensus of the network. Any confirmed
transactions on the blockchain cannot be changed.
ü   Permanence: What happens on the blockchain stays on the blockchain. A public blockchain will act
as a public ledger, meaning that as long as the blockchain remains operative, the data on it will be
accessible.
ü   Removal  of  intermediaries:  The  P2P  nature  of  the  blockchain  does  away  with  the  need  for
intermediaries and users to interact directly with one another. With the removal of intermediaries and
the distributed ledger being updated in real-time by the miners, any data inputted on the blockchain is
transmitted and stored automatically.
ü   Decentralization of consensus: With no central authority acting as a clearinghouse for transaction
validation, the effort reeuired to reach consensus is shared between the miners.
ü   Transparency (pseudonymity): Public blockchains can offer full transparency of the transactions
carried out on the network while safeguarding the privacy of its users through pseudonymity since only
the transacting addresses are shown.
ü   Speed: Blockchain results in a much faster process than a centrally controlled ledger.
ü   Lower costs: The removal of intermediaries will result in lower transaction costs.
ü   Security: With the encryption through cryptography, no one other than the sender and recipient can
access the data sent across the blockchain.

7.3    Blockchain Smart Contracts
Blockchain technology enables the coding of simple contracts known as ismart contractsi that will execute
when specified conditions are met. It is capable of facilitating, executing, and enforcing the negotiation or
performance  of a  contracthagreement. The  entire  process  is  automated  and  can  act as  a  complement, or
substitute, for legal contracts with superior security to traditional contract laws and reduce other transaction
costs associated with contracting.
Smart contracts are a very useful feature for the blockchain technology that can pave the way to a completely
new scope of commercial and other applications of the blockchain technology as it can remove the intermediary
reeuired in commercial transactions.

7.4    The RED Platform Design
Restart Energy Democracy platform (RED-P) will connect the final consumer to the producer directly using the
existing grid via smart contracts within the frame and license of local private energy providers by managing
their entire supply activity as a service and including them in the same virtual balancing group managed by the
system.
Fig. 17 Schematic of RED-P
An energy supplier buys energy and sells it in retail, ensuring that production and consumption are matched
with hourly settlements. Otherwise, it can lose money by not gaining the extra energy that was not consumed
and by paying a high bill for the energy it did not have.
Individual euantities exchanged inside the system will not affect the total energy balance because they are
settled inside the system. This means it is possible for someone who owns an on-grid solar rooftop PV system
to sell the energy he inmects into the grid at peak times to someone who auctions for that energy on the RED-
P using blockchain and the intelligent wireless meters and watt predict technology developed by Restart Energy
to track and account for these energy exchanges inside the same virtual delimited balancing group.
It will enable its users to buy, sell, trade electrical energy using KW tokens issued by the company. Restart
Energy will allow physical delivery and offtake of the purchased or sold energy in the states where the company
is licensed to supply or has agreements in place with local suppliers.
Restart Energygs wireless intelligent meters work together with the RED-P. The wireless meters developed by
Restart Energy will measure produced and consumed energy and send this data using existing WiFi connections
in real time to Restart Energy servers and the RED-P allowing for instantaneous P2P trading.

Intelligent WiFi metering system
Restart Energy invested in a wireless, smart metering system that estimates power production for the next day.
It takes data from different sources such as historical trends of sunlight and solar radiation, cloudy days at
different time and location. The system recognizes the previously measured information, and the radar software
anticipates the cloud movement.
To make its RED-P more efficient and accurate, Restart Energy will integrate its smart metering system with
the Watt Predict software with producers for hourly settlement. This system alone will help to predict the energy
output and will allow for 30% more efficient energy transactions, settlements, supply, and trade.
Existing energy supply software suite
Our software engineers have developed the first integrated software suite for the Romanian power and gas
markets.
myRestart Mobile App
Restart Energy developed a mobile application for Android and IOS to service its energy customers. The Restart
Energy mobile app allows customers to see their energy consumption in real time  (if they have wifi meters
installed), send meter reading, view historical consumption, see and pay invoices, 24h support, send messages
and notifications, update personal info, view scheduled grid repairs and latest news on Restartopedia.

8  PROMOTION !STRATEGY !AND !MARKET !TRACTION !
The market development of Central and Eastern Europe is at an intermediate phase between Western markets
and euickly growing emerging markets. Different stages being already accomplished we can find different levels
of market maturity present.
Evolving rhythms are different from market to market and also Balkans countries are characterized by being
significantly more fragmented compared to Western Europe.
Restart Energy development started on Romanian market, the biggest market in the Balkans.
Romania,  as  part  of  the  European  Union  single  market,  is  a  fast  developing,  upper-middle  income  mixed
economy with a skilled labor force.   It is the 16th largest in the European Union by total nominal GDP and the
13th largest based on purchasing power parity.
The Romanian economy is the 49th-largest economy in the world (out of 190 countries measured by IMF) with
204,943 billion USD annual output, and ranks 63rd in the world within terms of GDP per capita measured by
purchasing power parity13. Romanian economy is expected to grow by 7% in 2017. Based on current economic
growth, itgs expected to hit  1 trillion of USD PPP before  2035. Romania continues to be one of the leading
nations in Central and Eastern Europe for attracting foreign direct investment  (FDI): the inward FDI in the
country with a cumulative FDI totaling more than 170 billion USD since 1989.

Romania is the largest electronics producer in Central and Eastern Europe.
Up until the late 2000s financial crisis, the Romanian economy had been referred to as a iTigeri due to its high
growth rates and rapid development. Until 2009, Romanian economic growth was among the fastest in Europe
(officially                                                                                                             8.4%  in  2008 and more than three times the EU average). Romania is rich in iron ore, oil, salt,
uranium, nickel, copper and natural gas. The country is a regional leader in multiple fields, such as IT and motor
vehicle production.
Bucharest, the capital city, is one of the largest financial and industrial centers in Eastern Europe. According to
Eurostat Romania posted the biggest economic growth in EU in 2016 by more than 6% increase of GDP.
The promections for economic growth in Romania for 2018 and 2019 were both lifted by 0.3 percentage points
to 3.7% and 3.5%, respectively, the World Bank said in its fune 2017 Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report.
Restart  Energygs  strategy  outlined  below  is  designed  and  used  for  the  Romanian  market.  For  the  global
expansion of RED to more than  35 countries, Restart Energy will develop a sales strategy tailored to each
countrygs needs and ecosystem.
Since its inception, Restart Energy continues to grow aggressively. It has successfully developed a multichannel
sales  strategy  by  euickly  identifying  market  opportunities  and  leveraging  local  resources  such  as  micro-
entrepreneurs through the first retail energy franchise in the European Union. Sales channels currently used for
supplying energy and gas in Romania are as below:
1.   Local distribution partners who aceuire a franchise and sell energy to their long-standing customer.
This strategy has proved very successful so far and will be a mamor contribution to the national expansion.
2.   Formation     of     local     D2D     teams     around     the     best     local     franchised     partners.
                                                                                                                        3.   Own Sales Force that includes  1 National Sales Manager,  1 Logistics Manager,  8-person Contracting
Department,                                                                                                             7   Regional   Sales   Managers,                                                                            70   D2D   own   sales   agents   on   a   commission   basis.
4.   Partnerships with national companies like Euro GSM (largest ORANGE telecom dealer), Inter Broker (3rd
largest  insurance  broker),  GRS                                                                                       (largest  auto  insurance  broker),  Cashback  World                                                        (largest  cash-back
shopping network), Romanian Post  (5000+ country locations), TVSat  (largest regional media j telecom
company), Romanian War Veterans Organization, etc.

9  TOKEN !MODEL !
Restart Energy is committed to building a socially responsible business.   The token generation event, in addition
to  being  structured  in  accordance  with  all  regulatory  reeuirements,  is  established  as  a  reward  based
crowdfunding campaign, where contributors will receive MWAT Tokens in a sale of 30 million USD. A minimum
raised amount does not exist, as the companygs products and services are already functional on the market.
The token model takes into consideration that energy producers will be able to sell their energy on the RED-P
to smaller household and SME consumers at retail prices 30% higher compared to wholesale prices while the
consumers will purchase that energy 30% cheaper compared to the normal retail price.
In exchange for access to the RED platform, energy producers and prosumers allocate between 1% and 5% of
all the energy they trade on the RED platform through the RED Loyalty System to registered MWAT users. Thus,
by  allocating  1-5%  of  their  energy  tradings  through  the  RED  Loyalty  System  to  the  community,  energy
producers will be able to sell peer-to-peer the remaining 95-99% of their annual production at a price thatgs
30% higher than the market wholesale price (18.75% gain).
Restart Energy has agreements with energy producers currently operating more than 300 MW of renewable
generation capacity to start their collaboration with the RED platform and provide energy in exchange for access
to the platform and to MWAT holders. Restart Energy is in discussions for an additional 2,000 MW of existing
renewable generation capacities to enter the RED-P after its implementation.
9.1    MWAT: Real Utility from an EU Energy Provider
MWAT will be issued by Restart Energy in the TGE (Token Generation Event) and will be necessary to access
the RED platform software and the RED franchise. In addition, MWAT may be found on popular cryptocurrency
exchanges, after the conclusion of the TGE, where they can be traded as desired. The initial price of MWAT will
be 0.1 USD (10 US cents), during the sale.
The RED platform will provide access to green energy which the token holder can buy, use or sell to another
MWAT holder with the vehicle of transfer being KW tokens (KWT). Each KWT carries a virtual charge of 1 kWh.
Token holders can consume their owned KWT or sell them on the RED platform at any time  - an important
feature especially if token holders happen to be located in countries where Restart Energy has not yet connected
to the energy infrastructure and doesngt have a franchise in place, thus cannot deliver the energy via supply
contracts.
Each MWAT token can hold up to 1,000 KWT and also enables the buying or selling of 1,000 KWT per month
on the RED Platform. Thus, it can be said that MWAT tokens are a vehicle for storing and trading KWT.
Through the RED Loyalty System, energy producers on the platform will supply each MWAT that registers to
the RED-P software with 0.11 KWT, once the registration process is complete.
Owning sufficient MWAT grants the holdersg free access to the RED Franchises as follows:

regarding the brokering of energy sales and the option to create sub-franchises inside their country of residence
(can be more or less than 10,000,000 MWAT, depending on country population).
9.2    gW Token
Transactions on the RED platform will be done using KW tokens(KWT). 1 KWT o 1 kWh and it can be purchased
by the users of the RED platform with crypto and fiat currencies, in order to be consumed or sold on the RED
platform.
Users can also pay their energy invoices on the RED Platform, and with partnered energy producers, with their
KWT.
A user on the RED Platform can only ever store an amount of KWT eeual to his MWAT balance. That is, 1,000
KWT for each 1 MWAT.
All KWT associated with an account will undergo a full reset-to-zero once each year.
9.3    RED Loyalty System
The nature of the platform has allowed Restart Energy to give back to the community through the RED Loyalty
System, through which producers transfer platform-exclusive KWT to MWAT holders.
Through the RED Loyalty System, every MWAT that is registered on the platform will receive an initial  0.11
KWT    charge    from    the    energy    producers    upon    completion    of    the    registration    process.
In addition to the initial charge, the RED Loyalty System facilitates the transfer of 1-5% of the monthly energy
traded  by  producers  on  the  platform  to  registered  MWAT  token  holder  accounts  every  month,  directly
proportional to the amount of MWAT tokens held compared to the total registered amount. By accessing a large
retail base of p2p customers, energy producers will be able to sell their energy at a price 30% higher than the
market wholesale price.

11.3  RED Platform Expansion Plan
Given below is the expansion plan for the RED Platform, including the markets where we want to enter. The
platform will be fully developed and tested in 2018 and we expect to start its global expansion in the last euarter
of the year. Until then, Restart Energy will continue its plans of expanding the actual franchised energy supplying
business in the Central j Eastern Europe. The expansion plan was made taking into consideration only the
murisdictions (countries or states for UShCanada) that have at least started the liberalization process for their
energy markets or publicly declared that have plans of liberalization. Given this, we mention that the presented
expansion plan is submect to external factors such as changes of the energy-related legislation from the selected
countries or other potential markets.

We  became  the  fastest  growing  independent  energy  company  in  a
European   Country   by   tapping   into   the   vast  potential  of  micro
entrepreneurship  and  creating  new  mobs  with  the  Restart  Energy
Franchise. Restart Energygs token generation event is a black swan event
for  energy  monopolies;  itgs  history  in  the  making.  By  buying  RED
MegaWatt  Tokens,  you  get  an  opportunity  to  participate  in  a  great
business success story while also gaining access to the world-changing
Restart Energy Democracy Platform  - the only platform that lets you
send and receive energy, worldwide.

Function
How does RED work?
The MWAT token is an ERC20 digital cryptographic utility token issued by Restart Energy Democracy, using
blockchain technology that gives access to the services provided by the RED Platform Software and the RED
Franchise. This will be achieved thanks to the new service offered by Restart Energy Democracy  - the RED
Platform.
RED Platform
The RED Platform Software (RED-P) is a blockchain-based decentralized platform for Peer-to-Peer direct energy
trading between consumers and energy producers worldwide. RED-P is the software where users (and Restart
Energy clients) can log in and trade (buy; sell) energy directly P2P (peer-to-peer), in a decentralized and easy
to use manner. Users can get access to Restart Energy services and can obtain and use electricity.
RED Franchise
The RED Franchise is the first power retail franchise that makes it simple and easy to start and operate your
own power utility company. Allows token holders to develop its own power retail business and earn revenues
by selling energy to retail households and business consumers, RED franchise is the business opportunity that
owners of MWAT can get access to. It is an innovative, tested and working idea that is growing in a rapid
manner. The energy franchise brings the decentralized world of energy one step closer to a truly free market
in the energy sector.

MWAT Token Use
Do we generate all tokens at once?
les. Once the smart contract is createdq
What happens with unsold MWAT Tokens?
Unsold tokens will be burned.
Will there be secondary (non-RED-P) trading exchanges for RED and gW token?
MWAT Tokens are received in your ETH wallet and they are used to access RED platform. lou can sell or buy
them on any of the secondary (Non-RED platform) markets where MWAT will be available.
KWT, on the other hand, is an internal use token, that has a direct report to RED Platform as a representation
of an energy unit.
Can I refill any time my MWAT token with energy at a preferred price?
Each MWAT token gives you access to the ability to buy or sell up to  1,000 KW TokenshMonth on the RED
Platform Software.
Am I limited to use the MWAT token for a certain market?
lou can access the RED platform from anywhere in the world and use the P2P energy exchange, however,
Restart Energy can only deliver electricity in countries where the company will be licensed as a private energy
supplier or where a Type A RED Franchise is deployed.
Can I pay my bills with energy stored on the blockchain?
lesq That is the basic functionality, among others. The KW Tokens that you purchase on the RED Platform
represent units of energy that will be deducted from your energy invoice if you are a customer of Restart Energy
or of a RED Franchise.
If I choose to pay my bills using the gW token, where can I find the conversion rate?
Calculated LIVE on our platform.
Are MWAT Tokens consumed if I use or sell the associated gW tokens?
MWAT Tokens are not consumed or used if you use or sell the associated KW Tokens.
How can I obtain/use ereen Certificates?
Consumers holding RED Tokens will automatically receive 1 Cryptographic Green Certificate for each 1 MWh
consumed from renewable sources. The green certificates will be tradable on a secondary market on the RED
platform and companieshcontributors around the world will have access to purchase them in order to support
renewable energy consumptionhproduction and reduce their carbon footprint.

RED Platform Use
If I 'consume' MWAT Tokens do I get one-time gWT 'fill' on the RED Platform?
MWAT Tokens grant you access to the platform (FREE), as you consume the energy in the form of KW Tokens
that are deposited in the MWAT tokens, not the MWAT tokens themselves.
If I keep MWAT Tokens (on RED Platform) will I get monthly / yearly bonus gWT on my
MWAT Tokens?
les, on a monthly basis your MWAT Token account will receive a loyalty bonus in the form of KW Tokens,
provided by producers on the RED Platform.
Can I sell MWAT on the platform at any moment?
les, on secondary marketsq Restart Energy will provide access to the RED Platform to its existing  30,000
customers only if they own MWAT Tokens. Owning the tokens gives access to a P2P global energy exchange
platform. Restart Energy wongt buy the tokens back.
RED Franchise Use
What type of resources will be received as a benefit from a franchise?
lou will have the opportunity to earn energy and revenues from running the franchise business.
Can I upgrade a city franchise to regional/country later in time?
lesq The first three Type B franchises tiers are not exclusive, but for the Master Franchise, we would offer such
on a first-come-first-served principle.
How will I benefit from an externalized service of purchasing electricity?
fust like everybody benefits from free market principles, you will find the best prices on the decentralized
network, but even better, you can optimize your energy costs by purchasing directly from producers and choose
the renewable sources you want to promote.

DISCLAIMER  - RISgS AND DISCLOSURES
Disclaimer and Main - Risks
Please read this disclaimer notice carefully. Please note that the disclaimer set out below may be altered or
updated, at any time in whole or in part at the sole discretion of the Company. lou should read it in full each
time you visit the site.
All information is provided without any warranties of any kind and the Company. and its advisors make no
representations and disclaim all express and implied warranties and conditions of any kind, including, without
limitation,  representations,  warranties  or  conditions  regarding  accuracy,  timeliness,  completeness,  non-
infringement, suitability of the Tokens for any prospective contributor, and the Company and its employees,
officers or professional advisors assume no responsibility to you or any third party for the conseeuence of errors
or omissions.
Regulatory Risks
The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets, and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled
in many murisdictions, herein included also the Romanian murisdiction.   It is difficult to predict how or whether
governmental authorities will regulate such technologies or what tax implications could arise for the holders of
the MWAT tokens. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make
changes to existing laws, regulations andhor rules that will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain
technology and its applications. Such changes could negatively impact MWAT Tokens in various ways, including,
for  example,  through  a  determination  that  MWAT  Tokens  are  regulated  financial  instruments  that  reeuire
registration. The Company may cease the distribution of MWAT Tokens, the development of the Promect or
cease operations in a murisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially
undesirable to continue to do so.
The industry in which Company operates is new and may be submect to heightened oversight and scrutiny,
including investigations or enforcement actions.   There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will
not  examine  the  operations  of  Company  andhor  pursue  enforcement  actions  against  Company.    Such
governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting Company in particular.   All of this may submect
Company to mudgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Company to restructure its operations and
activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm Companygs reputation or lead
to higher operational costs, which may, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the MWAT Tokens andhor
the development of the Promect.
Restricted Territories
Viewing the materials available hereafter may not be lawful in certain murisdictions. In other murisdictions, only
certain categories of person may be allowed to view such materials. Any person who wishes to view these
materials must first satisfy themselves that they are not submect to any local reeuirements that prohibit or
restrict them from doing so.
The materials are for information purposes only and do not constitute or form a part of any offer or invitation
to sell or issue, or solicitation of any offer, to purchase or subscribe for the Tokens in any murisdiction or
murisdictions in which such offers or sales are unlawful prior to registration or eualification under the securities
laws of any such murisdiction (restricted territories).
Accordingly, unless an exemption under the relevant securities law is applicable, the Tokens may not be offered,
sold, pledged, taken up, exercised, resold, renounced, transferred or delivered, directly or indirectly, in or into
a restricted territory where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of, or reeuire registration
thereof in, such murisdiction.

There will be no public offering of the Tokens in the restricted territories. If you are not permitted to view
materials on this webpage or are in any doubt as to whether you are permitted to view these materials, please
exit this webpage.
The Company shall not have any responsibility in respect of access to it from territories whose laws prohibit
such access or where any aspect of the content of the site may be illegal. Those who choose to access this site
from other locations do so on their own initiative and at their own risk and are responsible for compliance with
applicable local laws.
Currency Regulation Risks
Governments are still grappling with public policy on the regulation of cryptocurrencies as a form of settlement
in trade. Governments adverse to the proliferation of the use of cryptocurrencies in local commerce could issue
laws and regulations deeming the use of cryptocurrencies a regulated activity. In recent weeks, countries such
as China and Korea have issued regulations or statements prohibiting token sales, the United States allowing
only certified investors to participate to the sale while other countries have sought to bring the sale of tokens
within the regulator control of securities offerings. This could result in holders of MWAT tokens being unable to
use their MWAT in the future without further regulatory compliance by MWAT.
Risks Associated with Use of RED token Network
Use of cryptocurrency exchanges can be complex and submect to stringent eualification reeuirements. There is
no guarantee that the developers will be able to successfully create a system that allows payment for services
using global cryptocurrencies. The failure to establish a network will result in decreased lieuidity of the MWAT
token as a form of settlement currency within the RED MWAT token Network.
Risks Associated with Crowd Sale
MWAT tokens are not investment products. Rather, MWAT tokens serve a specific function within the RED
Platform Software and RED ecosystem, which is the means to access and purchase active energy at a lower
cost. Without MWAT tokens, the general public may not access the MWAT token system. There is also no
expectation of future profit or gain from the aceuisition of MWAT tokens. For these and other reasons, we
believe  the  sale  of  MWAT  tokens  does  not  constitute  a  public  offering  of  securities  submect  to  prospectus
registration reeuirements. However, public policy towards token sales is changing, and it is conceivable that
regulators may in the future seek to broaden the scope of regulation of token sales. This could make token
sales submect to registration reeuirements in the United States and similar murisdictions. If the MWAT token sale
becomes submect to registration reeuirements, this would delay or potentially postpone the proposed MWAT
token sale indefinitely.
Taxation Risks
The use of MWAT as a form of settlement currency may or may not be submect to local income tax, capital gain
taxes, VAT or other forms of taxes. This uncertainty in tax legislation may expose merchants and customers
alike to unforeseen future tax conseeuences associated with the use of MWAT tokens, as a settlement currency,
andhor the trading of tokens or MWAT tokens for capital gains.
Capital Control Risks Many murisdictions, such as China impose strict controls on the cross-border flow of capital.
MWAT holders may be submect to these regulations andhor arbitrary enforcement of such regulations at any
time. This would make the transfer of MWAT tokens out of the local murisdiction to overseas exchanges an
unlawful activity exposing the user of MWAT tokens to government fines or other regulatory sanction.
CTF and Anti-Money Laundering Regulations
The United States has issued a series of regulations to combat terrorist financing (CTF) and money-laundering
activities. Many other countries have enacted similar legislation to control the flow of capital for such illicit
activities. The use of crypto-currencies by bad actors would breach such regulations. Any illicit use of the MWAT

token  could  seriously  impact  the  global  reputation  of  the  RED  token  Network.  In  such  event,  it  is  not
inconceivable that this could trigger scrutiny by CTF and anti-money laundering regulators and potentially cause
significant disruption to the distribution and circulation of tokens and MWAT token in the RED token ecosystem.
Blockchain Risks
On the Ethereum blockchain, timing of block production is determined by proof of work so block production can
occur at random times. For example, ETH contributed to the MWAT token Distribution Contract in the final
seconds of a distribution period may not get included for that period. Buyer acknowledges and understands
that the Ethereum blockchain may not include the Buyergs transaction at the time Buyer expects and Buyer may
not  receive  MWAT  tokens  the  same  day  Buyer  sends  ETH.  The  Ethereum  blockchain  is  prone  to  periodic
congestion  during  which  transactions  can  be  delayed  or  lost.  Individuals  may  also  intentionally  spam  the
Ethereum network in an attempt to gain an advantage in purchasing cryptographic tokens. Buyer acknowledges
and understands that Ethereum block producers may not include Buyergs transaction when Buyer wants or
Buyergs transaction may not be included at all. MWAT token may be submect to expropriation and orhtheft.
Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the MWAT token Distribution
Contract or the MWAT token in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service
attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Ethereum
platform rests on open source software and MWAT tokens are based on open source software, there is the risk
that  Ethereum  smart  contracts  may  contain  intentional  or  unintentional  bugs  or  weaknesses  which  may
negatively affect MWAT tokens or result in the loss of Buyergs MWAT token, the loss of Buyergs ability to access
or control Buyergs MWAT token or the loss of ETH in Buyergs account. In the event of such a software bug or
weakness, there may be no remedy and holders of MWAT tokens are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or
compensation. The Promect and all of the matters set forth in the White Paper are new and untested. The Promect
might not be capable of completion, implementation or adoption. It is possible that no blockchain utilizing the
Promect will ever be launched and there may never be an operational platform. Even if the Promect is completed,
implemented and adopted, it might not function as intended, and any tokens associated with a blockchain
adopting the Promect may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable. Also, technology is changing
rapidly, so the MWAT token and the Promect may become outdated. The regulatory status of cryptographic
tokens, digital assets, and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many murisdictions. It is difficult to
predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies. It is likewise difficult to predict
how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations andhor rules that
will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications. Such changes could
negatively impact MWAT token in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that MWAT
tokens are regulated financial instruments that reeuire registration. The Company may cease the distribution
of MWAT, the development of the Promect or cease operations in a murisdiction in the event that governmental
actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so.
Buyer gnowledge and Risks of Prooect
Buyer  has  sufficient  knowledge  and  experience  in  business  and  financial  matters,  including  a  sufficient
understanding  of  blockchain  or  cryptographic  tokens  and  other  digital  assets,  smart  contracts,  storage
mechanisms (such as digital or token wallets), blockchain-based software systems and blockchain technology,
to be able to evaluate the risks and merits of Buyergs purchase of MWAT Tokens, including but not limited, to
the matters set forth in this Agreement, and is able to bear the risks thereof, including loss of all amounts paid,
loss of MWAT, and liability to the Company Parties and others for its acts and omissions. Buyer has obtained
sufficient information in order to make an informed decision to purchase MWAT Tokens.
The Promect and all of the matters set forth in the White Paper are new and untested.   The Promect might not
be capable of completion, implementation or adoption.   It is possible that no blockchain utilizing the Promect will
ever  be  launched  and  there  may  never  be  an  operational  platform.    Even  if  the  Promect  is  completed,
implemented and adopted, it might not function as intended, and any tokens associated with a blockchain
adopting the Promect may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable.   Also, technology is changing
rapidly, so the MWAT Tokens and the Promect may become out-dated.

Business Risks
The Company plans to conduct closings of sales of MWAT tokens as funds are received. If less than 5,000,000
USD is received from the sale of MWAT tokens, the Company may have insufficient cash to implement its plans
as described below, and MWAT token purchasers who bought the Tokens shall be at a heightened risk of loss
of their contributions. The Companygs principal competitors may have greater financial resources than those
available to the Company and thus be in a better position to attract talent, initiate promects and offer lower
prices for electricity. The Companygs ability to remain competitive may depend in part upon its ability to develop
new and enhanced products or services and to introduce these products or services in a timely and cost-effective
manner. In addition, product and service introductions or enhancements by the Companygs competitors or the
use of other technologies could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the Companygs existing
products  and  services.  There  can  be  no  assurances  that  the  Company  shall  be  successful  in  selecting,
developing, and marketing new products and services or in enhancing its existing products or services. Failure
to do so successfully may adversely affect the Companygs business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The Companygs ability to realize its obmectives shall be dependent on its ability to attract and retain additional,
eualified personnel. Competition for such personnel can be intense, and there can be no assurance that the
Companygs results shall not be adversely affected by difficulty in attracting andhor retaining eualified personnel.
The industry in which Company operates is new and may be submect to heightened oversight and scrutiny,
including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will
not  examine  the  operations  of  Company  andhor  pursue  enforcement  actions  against  Company.  Such
governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting Company in particular. All of this may submect
Company to mudgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Company to restructure its operations and
activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm Companygs reputation or lead
to higher operational costs, which may, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the MWAT token andhor the
development of the Promect.
Further on, any transaction concluded based on this Whitepaper shall be considered as a random agreement
(in Romanian language called icontract aleatoriui), meaning that the length and even the enforceability of the
rights provided herein is not knownhentirely know at the moment of its signing, given that the main rights and
obligations of this agreement depend on one or several future events and therefore any of the signing party
bear the risk of winning or losing depending on such future events.
