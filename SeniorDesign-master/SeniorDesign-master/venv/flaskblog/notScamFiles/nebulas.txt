Nebulas is a decentralized platform which provides a search framework for all
blockchains.
Non-technical White Paper
PLEASE SEE IMPORTANT INFORMATION AT THE END OF THIS WHITE PAPER
Summary
Bitcoin brings "decentralized currency" to the world of blockchains, while
Ethereum system showcases "smart contract". Blockchain has already gained
significant development and prosperity in the past three years. However, we find
the existing technology far from being perfect. Blockchain starts to face more
and more challenges in its integration with current business and user
requirements.
This white paper mainly focuses on three concepts: value rank of blockchains,
the positive feedback ecosystem, and the self-evolving blockchain system.
Based on these, we present Nebulas' idea and solutions, which consists of
Nebulas Rank (the measure of value for blockchains) and Nebulas Force (a
fundamental self-evolving mechanism for blockchains).   We will also elaborate
on the mechanism of our innovation in consensus: PoD (Proof of Devotion) and
DIP (Developer Incentive Protocol).

The ultimate mission of the Nebulas Blockchain is to build a self-evolving
blockchain system based on value incentive, which will also be the most
important development direction in the world of blockchains hereafter. As
commonly known in the current industry, core components such as smart
contracts, domain name systems, developer toolkits, wallets, etc., are being
provided as part of the launch of the Nebulas platform.

1 Background
On 31st Oct 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper titled: "Bitcoin: A
Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", which marked the birth of blockchain in
our world.
As the blockchain's primordial application, Bitcoin puts its ideal as "a
decentralized digital currency system" into practice, as well as presents the
world blockchains' gigantic value and potential. Gradually, more and more
people start to follow, study, and devote to blockchains, which promotes
sustainable development in the blockchain infrastructure. In doing so, the
blockchain community contributes to creating more connection between our real
world and its application data, opening up brand-new frontier constantly.
It is worthy to state that blockchain itself is not an entirely new technology but a
new model of collaboration based on a combination of technologies (including
P2P network, cryptology, blockchain data structure, etc.). Blockchain essentially
is an autonomous system that is decentralized, with the foundation in the game
theory, the real charm of which is its open collaboration model based on
consensus mechanism under the ideology of decentralization.
We are happy to see that blockchain's function is transforming from monotone
simplicity to diversity, and it's still experimenting and making breakthroughs.
Bitcoin is a decentralized cash system, while the second generation blockchain
system represented by Ethereum brings up the concept of "smart contract" with
Turing completeness, which enables the blockchain with logical judgment and
processing capability. Meanwhile, some other blockchain systems propose
grander concepts like "cross-chain interoperability", "blockchain operating
system", etc. These endeavors all pushes blockchain evolving from dots to a
plane in 2 dimensions, eventually to a space of higher dimensionality.

2 Opportunities and Challenges
We believe that a decentralized, autonomous system represented by blockchains
is the coming trend, which has excited more and more attention and study.
Meanwhile, various blockchain projects are developing at tremendous speed,
and crypto assets' value is increasing at an exponential rate.
By one estimate, the global blockchain technology market is expected to be worth
US$ 20 bn by the end of 2024 as compared to US$ 315.9 mn in 2015.   By the end of
2017, the global crypto asset overall market cap has reached US$ 610 bn, as
compared to US$ 18 bn in 2016.   At the same time, the user population in
blockchains and digital assets is increasing at high speed. At the beginning of
2013, the global users in the industry were 2 million, and by the beginning of
2018, the number had grown to 20 million. We believe that around 2020, the
global users of blockchains/digital assets shall reach or exceed 200 million,
and around the year of 2025, this number is expected to reach 1 billion. Based
on this estimation, blockchain innovation currently faces an unprecedented
window of golden opportunity.
Meanwhile, the blockchain also faces many challenges, such as the interaction
of information on blockchains, protocol's upgrade, blockchain applications &
smart contracts' effectiveness and relevance judgment, etc.
The problem of interaction of information on blockchains is actually caused by
lack of interoperability among different blockchain networks. We have reached a
consensus in the industry on this problem, but by now, there exists no perfect
solution. The crucial matter here rests on interactions of data/assets on chains,
off-chain, and as well as on cross chains. That has significantly restricted the
full potential of blockchain technology, which has caused the so-called
"information silos" on chain and off-chain. More and more blockchain projects
are trying to make breakthroughs on this issue, but, for now, there are no unified
4                                                                                    nebulas.io




protocols and standards for data/ assets on different blockchains, which causes
interoperability deficiency, both internally within, and externally between,
blockchains.
Unlike common software version iterations connected with the rollout of
software updates, upgrading a blockchain network protocol often triggers "hard
forks" or "soft forks". A hard fork is when a single cryptocurrency splits in two. It
occurs when a cryptocurrency’s existing code is changed, resulting in both an
old and new version. Meanwhile a soft fork is essentially the same thing, but the
idea is that only one blockchain (and thus one coin) will remain valid as users
adopt the update. So both fork types create a split, but a hard fork is meant to
create two blockchain/coins and a soft fork is meant to result in one.
Bitcoin, for example, experienced a hard fork in August 2017 due to scalability
issues. The bitcoin scalability problem is a consequence of the fact that blocks
in the blockchain are limited to one megabyte in size. Bitcoin miner fees for
processing bitcoin transactions is estimated to have risen to above $25 per
transaction in 2017, making small payments uneconomical.   Bitcoin's blocks
include the transactions on the bitcoin network. In contrast to Visa's peak of
24,000 transactions per second, the bitcoin network's theoretical maximum
capacity with the 1MB block size limit sits between 3.3 to 7 transactions per
second. Due to block capacity's severe insufficiency, there had been incident in
which almost 1 million transactions are pending in the transaction pool to be
recorded on blocks. Under current circumstances, there exists tremendous
uncertainty on Bitcoin's transfer time, and users have to pay extra high
"transaction expediting fee", which injures user experiences.
Ethereum has also experienced hard forks. In 2016, as a result of the collapse of
The DAO project, Ethereum was split into two separate blockchains: the new
separate version became Ethereum (ETH), and the original continued as
Ethereum Classic (ETC).   Despite solving the problem temporarily, the fork still
5                                                                                       nebulas.io




produced "double assets" of ETH & ETC, as well as community division as a
"side effect".
With the rapid growth of distributed applications (DApps), an efficient search
engine for blockchain applications and smart contacts become one of
blockchain’s biggest challenges. Now there are hundreds of DApps based on
Ethereum. If one day the number of DApps on blockchains reaches the same
scale of the App Store, it will be a big problem to search and find right DApps
for users. From this point of view, the blockchain world lacks a measure for
more dimensions of information and rank value, which will facilitate
discovering the wonderland of blockchains for users.

3 Why Nebulas?
Nebulas Architecture
Facing the opportunity and challenge described above, we aim to create a self—
evolving blockchain system based on value incentive.
7                                                                                nebulas.io




Nebulas World
More specifically, our targets are:
• Defining Rank Value
We believe that world of blockchains needs a standard of value to measure the
value of blockchain's' underlying data so as to explore information's higher
dimension, which serves to discover and uncover more value of blockchains.
• Building Positive Feedback for Community Ecosystem
We believe that to build a prosperous decentralized application ecosystem, a
developer-friendly positive feedback mechanism is a fundamental requirement.
Only this kind of application ecosystem can empower the blockchain system
with stronger vitality.
• Achieving Self-evolution
8                                                                               nebulas.io




We believe that a blockchain system endowed with a self-evolution mechanism
can evolve automatically. With little external intervention, the system will provide
faster computing, more powerful systems and better user experiences.
9                                                                                      nebulas.io




4 Technical Features
Nebulas Rank (NR)
Nebulas Rank (NR) is our core ranking algorithm and is the measure of value in
the world of blockchains. It is pen sourced. The algorithm is based on liquidity,
propagation of users' assets, and the interactivity between users. NR is used to
rank addresses, smart contracts, distributed applications (DApps) and other
entities on the blockchain.
Nebulas Rank (NR)
In Nebulas, we measure value regarding:
• Liquidity
10                                                                                  nebulas.io




Finance essentially is the social activity that optimizes social resources via
capital liquidity and promotes economic development. Blockchains establish a
value network in which financial assets can flow. Daily volume of Bitcoin and
Ethereum, which are most familiar to us, already exceeds $1 billion. From these
data, we can see that the more transaction volume and transaction scale, the
higher liquidity. In turn, higher liquidity will increase the quantity of transaction
and enhance the value. That will further strengthen financial assets' value,
creating a complete positive feedback mechanism. Therefore liquidity, i.e.
transaction frequency and scale, is the first dimension that NR measures.
• Propagation
Social platforms like WeChat and Facebook have almost 3 billion active users
per month. Social platforms' rapid user growth is a result of the reflection of
existing social networks and stronger viral growth. In particular, viral
transmission, i.e. speed, scope, depth of information transmission and linkage, is
the key index to monitor the quality and user growth of social networks. In the
blockchain world, we can see the same pattern. Powerful viral propagation
indicates scope and depth of asset liquidity, which can promote the blockchain
world's asset quality and asset scale. Thus, viral transmission, i.e. scope and
depth of asset liquidity, is the second dimension that NR measures.
• Interoperability
At the Internet's early stage, there were only basic websites and private
information. Now, information on different platforms can be forwarded on the
network, and isolated data silos are gradually being broken. This trend is the
process of identifying higher dimensional information. In our point of view, the
world of blockchains will follow a similar pattern, but its speed will be faster. The
information on users, assets, smart contracts, and DApps will become richer,
and the interaction of higher dimensional information will be more frequent.   As
a result, better interoperability will become more and more important. Therefore,
NR's third measure dimension is interoperability.
11                                                                                      nebulas.io




Based on above-stated dimensions, we start to construct Nebulas' NR system
by drawing from richer data, building a better model, digging up more diversified
value dimensions, and establishing a measure of value in blockchain world.
Proof-of-Devotion (PoD)
Based on Nebulas' NR system, we will adopt PoD (Proof-of-Devotion)
consensus algorithm. PoD gives an "influential" user on the Nebulas blockchain
an opportunity to become a bookkeeper and receive Nebulas block rewards and
transaction fee as revenue, which will encourage them to contribute to the
stability and security of the Nebulas blockchain on a continuous basis.
PoD algorithm's core concept:
users with NR values higher than a specified threshold may take part in the
bookkeeper selection procedure by paying a security deposit;
through virtual mining, each bookkeeper candidate competes to earn
bookkeeping rights;
users with bookkeeping right are responsible for block generation, and in return
receive block reward and transaction fee as revenue; and
if any user behaves in an inappropriate fashion, the user’s security deposit will
be confiscated and reassigned to other bookkeeper candidates.
Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP)
For the Nebulas blockchain, we are proposing the concept of DIP (Developer
Incentive Protocol) for developers of smart contracts and DApps.
12                                                                                  nebulas.io




DIP's core concepts:
in pre-specified block intervals, for those developers whose smart contracts and
DApps deploy online in the most recent interval with an NR value higher than a
specified threshold, DIP will reward them corresponding developer incentives,
and these incentives shall be recorded on blocks by bookkeepers, and with DIP's
positive incentive mechanism, more and more developers will get incentives to
create valuable smart contracts and DApps, which will, in turn, help to build a
positive feedback ecosystem for the developers community.
Nebulas Force (NF)
A series of basic protocols such as NR, PoD, DIP will become a part of the
Nebulous blockchain data. With the growth of data on the Nebulas blockchain
these basic protocols will upgrade. We call this fundamental capability of the
Nebulas blockchain "Nebulas Force" (NF).   NF provides the Nebulas blockchain
and its distributed applications built on top of it, the capability to self evolve.
With NF developers are able to make changes, incorporate new technologies,
and fix bugs without needing to hard fork.
As the Nebulas community grows, NF and update ability for protocols will be
opened to the community. According to the NR weight of users and by using the
community voting mechanism, the community will be able to determine the
evolution and direction of the Nebulas blockchain and its update objectives. With
the help of NF's core technology and its openness, Nebulas will have ever
growing and infinitely evolving potential.
Additionally, Nebulas is also developing a forward-looking mechanism of
Nebulas Cluster Polymorphous Evolution. On the premise that data and assets
on the main blockchain are safe, through an inborn Nebulas Excitation Protocol,
one or several side chains will be created to verify core technical innovation
13                                                                                    nebulas.io




solutions, such as new consensus algorithm, lightning network, etc. At the same
time, through the Nebulas Wormhole, data and assets can be exchanged across
side chains as well as between side chains and the main blockchain, as well as
interoperability among DApps.
In this process, users on the main Nebulas blockchain can invest on side chains
to test newly offered NAS using side chain technology. (See Section 8 below for
a discussion regarding potential future distributions of NAS.)   They can also
keep their assets on the Nebulas blockchain while benefiting from evolutionary
advancements as the main Nebulas blockchain update smoothly. For example, as
optimized performance increases earnings for users, Nebulas can upgrade its
core architecture safely, in an economical way, thus giving Nebulas
unprecedented vitality and scalability.
For those side chain technical innovations that haven’t been accepted by the
Nebulas blockchain, it is possible to let those side chain innovations continue to
develop. Using the Nebulas Wormhole, side chain activity can still take
advantage of exchanges of data and assets across side chains, as well as DApp
Interoperability. Imagine, for example if blockchain systems like Bitcoin, Litecoin,
ETH and ETC had the native ability built in for data and asset exchanges, we
would immediately face many more dimensions of technical possibilities.
14                                                                                     nebulas.io

5 Use Cases
Since the generation of Bitcoin's genesis block in 2009, the community has
come to a consensus as to the objective of most of the existing public
blockchains:   create an infrastructure for building a DApp ecosystem which is
developer-friendly and features a complete incentive mechanism. However, due
to various historical restrictions, to date there is still not such a systematic and
efficient mechanism.
So, from the beginning, Nebulas is striving to build an open and transparent
positive feedback ecosystem for the developers community.
Compared with current Internet industry, any platform that can attract the most
diversified developers is the most valuable. For example, the Apple App Store has
opened entirely new prospects for mobile applications by establishing an
application ecosystem that creates tremendous social value and business
returns. Unfortunately, even in this case, there still exist many flaws on its
dividend model for contributors who develop applications for the platform. For
example, developers on the platform cannot share in the growing valuation
bonus of the App Store platform (due to the increasing number of applications).
Can we establish a more inclusive developer incentive mechanism guaranteed by
blockchain technology? In such a world, every DApp developer would have the
chance to share the ecosystem benefits based on their contribution to the
blockchain world.
In the Nebulas blockchain, we make this possible through the DIP protocol.
Outstanding developers in the community will be able to receive NAS from DIP
offering. Those developers who make contributions to the community ecosystem
growth will be rewarded, which will create a positive feedback mechanism
offering to community developers.
16                                                                                     nebulas.io




Through NR, PoD and DIP, the Nebulas blockchain could put an end to the
current venture capital incubation model that is comparatively centralized,
inefficient, opaque, and unfriendly, by creating a way to motivate the creativity
and vitality of developers. Let's imagine, for example, that every App
development team creating apps for the Apple App Store could get considerable
incentives from Apple based on their contributions to App Store.   In this
paradigm, the app ecosystem would likely enter a new era with quality and
quantity explosion. Nebulas' vision is to institutionalize a decentralized
ecosystem for developer application incubation through DIP incentives. We
believe that the decentralized and incentivized world created by the Nebulas
blockchain will result in the emergence of a significant number of new
blockchain DApps.
The blockchain world is developing at an ever-accelerating speed. Every day we
see more and more DApp developers join the blockchain community and
connect more and more information on blockchains. How to present information
to users simply and efficiently will become more and more important.
We hope to further extend NR's functionality, i.e., by making information indexes
for blockchains. Combining NR with a "keywords" mechanism, we can sort and
manage information in a relevant way. In doing so, users of blockchains will be
able to access more relevant and high-value data (including information, assets,
smart contracts, DApps, etc.). Compared to the Google search engine in the
Internet world, with continuously explosive and tremendous information growth
of blockchains, an information index and search engine for blockchains becomes
an indispensable and necessary requirement. It will be an essential tool and the
starting point for many users to explore the world of blockchains. With the
power of information index and searching, as well as combining the Internet's
mature business model, Nebulas hopes to open up unprecedented business
potential.

7 Roadmap
Roadmap
19          nebulas.io




8 NAS Allocation Summary
Initially, there will be a finite supply of NAS Tokens (100,000,000) that are
intended to circulate among users and within the Nebulas Platform continuously.
It is not expected that NAS will be ‘burned’ and/or cancelled on the blockchain,
and they will therefore operate primarily as (i) reusable ‘in-app currency’; and
(ii) as a means for operating the Nebulas Platform.   In the future, Nebulas may
create additional NAS in connection with ongoing operations and functionality of
the Nebulas Platform as set forth below.
The intention is to create an internal economy within the Nebulas Platform,
whereby NAS will be an integral part which drives this ecosystem.   NAS will
therefore continuously circulate within the Nebulas ecosystem and the Nebulas
Platform, passing from one user to another as a means of consideration for
performance of the roles vital to the functioning of the Nebulas Platform.
As discussed, the Nebulas Platform will include “Nebulas Rank” or “NR”, a core
ranking algorithm used to measure the value in blockchain data and applications.
NR will be used to rank addresses, smart contracts, distributed applications and
other entities on the blockchain.   Based on the NR system, as also discussed,
Nebulas also intends to adopt a “Proof of Devotion” or “PoD” consensus
algorithm.   PoD gives influential user on the Nebulas Platform an opportunity to
become bookkeepers and receive Nebulas block rewards and transaction fee as
revenue, which will encourage them to contribute to the stability and security of
the Nebulas blockchain on a continuous basis.
In order to support the PoD consensus process, Nebulas may from time to time
generate additional NAS.   Presently, Nebulas expects to generate additional NAS
on an annual basis beginning at the end of 2019 at a rate of 3% of total NAS
supply in connection with the PoD program.
20                                                                                  nebulas.io




Finally, as described above, Nebulas also intends to create a “Developer
Incentive Protocol” or “DIP” for developers of smart contracts and DApps on
the Nebulas Platform.   The DIP process will be used by Nebulas to encourage
and reward developers who develop smart contracts and applications for the
Nebulas Platform.
In order to support the DIP incentive process, Nebulas may from time to time
generate additional NAS.   Presently, Nebulas expects to generate additional NAS
on an annual basis beginning at the end of 2019 at a rate of 3% of total NAS
supply in connection with the DIP program.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no assurance can be made that any additional
NAS will ever be generated in the future.   In addition, existing holders of NAS
will be entitled to determine on an annual basis with the incentives for the PoD
and DIP programs should be greater or less than 3% of the NAS supply.   Such
determination could impact the number of NAS, if any, created by Nebulas in the
future.
The distribution of NAS scheduled to occur at the beginning of 2018 is presently
intended to be allocated as follows:
21                                                                                 nebulas.io




NAS Distribution Plan
Community Offering
Under Nebulas Founding Team's charge, according to the project development
plan and requirements, most of the NAS shall be distributed to the community in
several rounds.
Incentive for Founders and Development Team
In Nebulas' development process, Nebulas' founders and development team in
the project's organizational structure continuously contribute manpower and
material resources to the technical development and ecosystem operation.
Therefore, 20% NAS are reserved for founders and development teams as an
incentive. Their NAS is subject to a three-year vesting and lockup period.
Operation and Ecosystem Construction
22                                                                                nebulas.io




Apart from the above two distributions, the remaining NAS will be used to
Nebulas' operational expansion and ecosystem construction, which includes but
is not limited to: the DApps ecosystem incubation, developer community,
