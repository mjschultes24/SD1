However, the problem that most people face when forming a masternode is that in order to form a masternode, there
is a minimum number of coins that participants need to possess, which often exceeds the capacity of most ordinary
participants. For example, the minimum amount required to form a DASH masternode is 1,000 DASH coins (equivalent
to USD 760,000). Another example is STRATIS coin, which requires 25,000 coins (equivalent to USD 1,700,000) to form a
masternode.
System build-up and maintenance that require professional knowledge is another problem that deters most small
participants. For example, a well-known masternode coin, DASH, requires both 1,000 DASH coins to form a single
masternode and 24 hours of non-stop servers and related programs for periodic operation.
2.5. Opportunities
Bitcoin volatility means “more regulation” of cryptocurrency is on the way. As can be inferred from the graph above,
Bitcoin's price volatility outstrips all other assets. High volatility implies high risk and this is the main reason why many
people regard in cryptocurrency as “speculation”, thus bringing about various regulation. This misconception has become
an obstacle to the development of cryptocurrency, in a further sense, blockchain.
However, with the introduction of masternoding, ordinary participants can now minimize their risk taking and still
generate sizable earnings. Moreover, now that many participants are seeking to find a reliable place, and it is high time that
we start focusing more on masternode platforms rather than existing exchange markets.

various fields. Nevertheless, large price fluctuation is making cryptocurrency seem “speculative” and is raising fears of
becoming a social problem.
The APIS Masternode Platform will provide both participants with a cyclic reward with minimized risk and the
market with reliability, accessibility and and reduced volatility. Ultimately, APIS aims to become the first key currency of
masternode coins.
3.2.    Platform Overview
The APIS Platform (also called “The APIS Core”) is a Ethereum public-chain based masternode platform that aims to
help individual and corporate users participatein desired masternodes easily and effectively. It supports both PC (personal
computer) and mobile devices, thereby providing users with the chance to make periodic reward and enjoy more
cryptocurrency’s benefits conveniently. This section explains the importance of the APIS Core along with the usefulness
and innovativeness of its official coin “APIS”, named after the ancient Egyptian bull deity.

In the case of existing masternode coins such as DASH, MEME and others, not only maintaining a certain amount of
coins on the software wallet but also implementing them on a Linux server that can be operated 24 hours stably is also
very crucial. However, these conditions are problematic for most people as they are not familiar with IT and resolving
maintenance problems inherent in hardware management, software update and security assurance. One purpose of our
platform is to deal with such inconveniences and let non-professional participants who wish to form a masternode take
part just by becoming a member of the APIS Platform without having to consider any of the annoying complications such
as hardware or software manipulation.
3.3.    Platform Configuration
3.3.1.    Masternode Core
A masternode core is a distributed database consisting of cutting-edge encryption technology to manage APIS
Masternode user reports, shares and trading records on the platform. Individual participants’ wallet information is securely
stored in the form of a Ethereum-based blockchain that also ensures system stability and asset protection through
systemic data backup and restoration. Masternode information that is already incorporated on the platform will be
accessible in the future through API and SDK that will be provided and all data communication will be encrypted as well.
Through this process, we can strengthen the scalability of the APIS platform.

3.3.2.    Masternode Hub
Masternode Hub composes and manages various coins such as DASH, MEME and BTDX's masternodes systematically.
When a masternode is newly formed from user participation, the masternode hub automatically creates VPS (Virtual
Private Server) for each masternode, prepares required up-to-date software and operates the masternode by depositing
designated amount of cryptocurrency in the wallet through the masternode core. All processes are carried out
automatically and the users are informed with a push-message every time there is progress in the procedure such as the
building of VPS, installation of software and creation of wallet.
Masternode Hub constantly reports rewards obtained from the running of each masternode to the masternode core
and allows them to clearly track their rewards through the APIS Core. Masternode Hub's hardware operates 24 hours by
our highly-experienced management team.
3.3.3.    APIS Core
APIS Core manages user information as well as APIS assets and provides all core functions that correlate with the
masternode core. APIS Core is an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-based blockchain program that can be connected with
various platforms such as Ethereum or Qtum and it makes use of POS methods. APIS Core supports multiple Operating
Systems (OS) such as Windows, Linux, Mac, Android and iOS.
3.4.    Platform Accessibility and Security
Distributed Network of APIS
Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS) attacks aimed at cryptocurrency are increasing these days. Cryptocurrency network
at its incipient stage is very vulnerable to attacks owing to its small number of nodes. Moreover, if nodes consisting a
network are regionally concentrated or disproportionately dispersed, there is a high chance that the transaction signals
might decrease in their efficiency.
In order to prevent this from happening, we will distribute our networks and evenly provide signals to different places.
For this purpose, APIS will build its system servers all around the world distributed and these servers will be located in
main IDCs worldwide, operating multiple servers.

3.5.    Platform Operating System
When users transfer other cryptocurrency(such as Bitcoin or Ethereum) to the APIS Core, they receive APIS coins of the
same value converted, which means all transactions on this platform are carried out in APIS coinage and are ready for
participating in desired masternodes through a function in the APIS Core.
Once the masternoding terminates, participant can receive their rewards according to their share/contribution. 5% of
the company’s reward generated from the APIS masternode platform will be donated to related foundations of blockchain
programming and development to improve current poor development condition.

3.5.1.    How to get an APIS coin
a) APIS coin can be purchased at other exchange platforms(to be listed)
b) APIS coin can be purchased in the APIS Core by sending other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin
and Ethereum to the APIS
(Wallet in the APIS Core(Cryptocurrencies sent will be automatically converted to APIS of equal value)
c) APIS coin can be purchased in our webpage using Paypal or other cryptocurrencies.

3.5.2.    The APIS Core -PC
The APIS core is a proprietary program that supports masternoding to various cryptocurrencies, participating in the APIS
masternode, APIS coin charges, APIS coin deposit and APIS coin withdrawal.
The role of the "masternode selection" function is to let users identify the conditions of a certain masternode such as
ROI, technology and price needed to form its masternode. Once the user selects a masternode to run from the list in the
APIS Core, the user can send any amount of APIS coins to the desired masternode.
Example) Kevin wants to form a DASH masternode, but he can only afford 100 DASH coins whereas the minimum number
of DASH coins needed to form a DASH masternode is 1,000. Kevin is aware that he can use the APIS Core to form a DASH
masternode with only 100 DASH coins. Once the designated time for masternoding ends, Kevin will receive 1/10 of the
total reward gained, which includes both principal and the total reward gained.

We are aiming for a differentiated operating policy from existing masternode coins. In the case of APIS, we adopt a
hierarchical operation system by differentiating rewarding rates according to the amount ofmasternodingvolume made in
the APIS masternode. Moreover, by applying Parallel Masternodes Technology, POS   Algorithm, we will realize 1 PC - Multi

involved with block rewards, so the fee typically comes off as
a burden of cryptocurrency use, not advantage. Although the
fee is small, each and every transaction necessitates a fee. This
is rather cumbersome and inefficient, particularly in countries
where domestic bank wire to the same bank does not require a
fee. Cryptocurrency use fees may therefore be a major barrier to
entry for people who wish to use the currency in a daily basis.
APIS aims to improve this fee system by introducing the
Mineral system. To use smart contract on APIS or transfer APIS
to another wallet, a separate currency called Mineral must be
used. APIS users may purchase Mineral through APIS whenever
required, and the APIS tokens spent on such transactions will be
distributed as block rewards. Mineral could also be obtained as
reward to APIS tokens placed in a personal wallet. Mineral will
be distributed proportional to the amount of APIS tokens held
in the wallet. The upper limit of Minerals receivable as reward
can also be adjusted depending on the level of contributions
a wallet has made to APIS network(such as APIS transactions),
so the most active APIS user can receive the most Minerals.
Of note, Minerals can only be used as transaction fees;
they cannot be sent to another wallet or user and cannot
be exchanged into APIS. Mineral still provides almost no-fee
environment to active APIS users, so a significant increase in
user transactions is expected as users attempt to minimize
their fees. Mineral system will therefore help real-world use of
APIS ecosystem.means a greater “fee” for them. To improve this
disincentive, APIS will do the following.
1) Mineral will automatically accumulate according to the
amount of APIS stored in the wallet.
2) Mineral can be purchased with APIS, but Mineral cannot
be converted to APIS.
3) Mineral cannot be sent to other addresses, but can only be
created and burned.
By creating this new Mineral system, we intend to contribute
to the popularization of the cryptocurrency market by enabling
faithful users of APIS to carry out several transactions without
any fee.
