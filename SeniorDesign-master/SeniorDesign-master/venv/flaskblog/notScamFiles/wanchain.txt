Module: this module provides three functions.          Wanchain, as an example to illustrate the
asset transfer-in data transmission process:




WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD                                                             10
Step1： Alice initiates a transaction OriTx with her OriAccount on the original chain to send an
asset OriAssetID to Wanchain’s locked account LockedAccount and broadcasts the cross-chain
transaction request InterTxReq to Wanchain via the cross-chain transaction data transmission
module.
The function takes the transaction data as parameters, such that:
OriTxInfo=(OriBlockNum,OriTx)
InterTxReq=(OriAccount,OriChainID,OriAssetID,value,OriTxInfo,sig)
Step2：：The cross-chain transaction proof node (Voucher) on Wanchain receives a cross-chain
transaction request and checks whether the transaction has been confirmed on the original chain
through the transaction status query module.
The function Token Locked Flag (TLF) takes OriTxInfo, OriChainID and OriAssetID as parameters,
such that:
TLF=CheckCommitment(OriChainID,OriAssetID,OriTxInfo)
Step3：  The cross-chain transaction proof node (Voucher) gathers consensus on the TLF results
and if TLF=true, then OriTx has been confirmed. The verification node (Validator) receives the data
TLF=true, and then checks the asset registry of the original chain. If it is a new asset, the asset will
be registered and added into the registry. The public account WANAccount, maintained by the
Validator initiates a transaction WANTx, deploys a smart contract for the new asset and distributes
tokens of Value for OriAccount in the contract. If it is a registered asset, the transaction WANTx
distributes tokens of Value for OriAccount directly into the existing asset contract. If WANTx is
confirmed, the Validator uses the cross-chain transaction data transmission module to reply to
Alice about the successful receipt of the cross-chain transaction:
response=(WANAccount,InterTxReq,True,addressSC,sigvalidator)
If WANTx becomes invalid, the locked account management node (Storeman) initiates a transac-
tion on the original chain to transfer Alice’s locked asset back to her account OriAccount.
If the consensus result for TLF is confirmed by the Voucher as false, the cross-chain transaction is
considered invalid.

Figure 3.1: Cross-Chain Data Process from Ethereum to Wanchain
In the next example, we have user Bob transferring Value from Wanchain back to the original
chain to illustrate the asset transfer-back data transmission process:
Step1： Bob uses BobAccount on Wanchain to send the transaction WANTx , which calls the asset
transfer-back function of the smart contract corresponding to the asset of the original chain.
Step2：  The Validator calls the smart contract after receiving the transaction. The Voucher tests
the results of the contract execution and gathers consensus. If TLF=true, which means that the
token value for Bob in the contract has been locked, the Storeman then broadcasts the transac-
tion of Locked Account, which transfers Value to BobAccount on the original chain, via the
cross-chain transaction data transmission module:
OriTx=(LockedAccount,BobAccount,value,sigstoreman)
The Voucher checks whether this transfer is confirmed via the transaction status query module,
and gathers consensus on confirmation flag TL F.
Step3： If the Token Unlocked Flag (TUF) = true, the Validator will clear the assets locked in the
smart contract; if TUF=false, it means that transaction on the original chain is not confirmed and
the Storeman will re-initiate the transaction.

Step1： Select a secure random number.
There are n validators on Wanchain, named as P₁……Pn. Each validator selects a secure random
number di and k-degree polynomial fi (x)=di+ai,1 x+⋯+ai,k-1x                                       . The scheme sends fi (j)to other
validators through secure channel and broadcasts di G to evk-1y node of the network, G being the
base point of the elliptic curve.
Step2： Check the correctness of the messages.
After receiving other validators’messages, Pj will check the correctness of the messages:
�lag=Check(f₁ (j),……,fn (j))
If flag=true, then Pj  accepts and saves it locally.




WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD                                                    16
If flag=false, then Pj  rejects it and requires other validators to resend the messages.
Step3:    Receive key share.
When all messages are sent and checked out, then every validator gets their key share:
key_sharek=∑(j=1) fj (k) ，k=1,……,n
Step4:    Compute the address of the Locked Account.
Locked_Account_Address=GenerateAddress(d₁ G,……,dn G)
After all the operations above, the Locked Acconunt is generated, its key is divided into n key
shares and then distributed to n validators of Wanchain.
Any operation on the Locked Account will require at least k of n validators’participation to
complete.

4.3.3  Scheme Generation
During the generation process of the Locked Account, the private key is never generated or recon-
structed in the entire network. Generating the signature of the Locked Account needs at least k
validators’participation. They compute the signature shares separately through the key shares
they hold, and then reconstruct the full signature using signature shares.
The Locked Account Signature Scheme is as follows:
Step1： Compute the Signature Shares
A quantity of n Wanchain Validators compute signature shares of the message using key shares
they hold:
signature_sharej=Generate_Sig(m,key_sharej)
Step2： Send out the signatures shares.
Each Validator sends its signature share to other Validators.
Step3：Reconstruct and broadcast the complete signature.
When a Validator receives more than k signature shares, it will reconstruct the full signature and
broadcast it to other Validators:
signature=Construct_Sig(signature_share₁,……,signature_sharek)
Step 4: The full signature of Locked Account is generated

(A₁,S₁ )=OTA_GenerateAccount((A,B))
Alice invokes the function OTA_ScanAccount( ) with her own scan key to scan every sub-account
(Ai,Si):
�lag=OTA_ScanAccount((Ai,Si ),(A,b))
When it comes to (A₁,S₁), the flag returns true. So (A₁,S₁) belongs to Alice. She invokes the function
OTA_GetPrivateKey( ) with her main private key to get the private key of (A₁,S₁):
sk=OTA_GetPrivateKey((A₁,S₁ ),(a,b))
In the One-time account system, the scankey helps Alice learn which sub-account belongs to her
and the main private key guarantees that she is the only one who can get the private key. No one
could change the owner of a sub-account without the associated scan key and get the private key
without main private key. Therefore, anonymity and security is guaranteed.

4.4.2  Ring Signature Scheme
The Ring Signature scheme was first provided in 2001 by Rivest and others. It is a special kind of
Group Signature scheme. A Group Signature scheme needs a trusted center and secure setup,
which would mean that the signer can be traced by the trust center. The Ring Signature scheme
solves this serious problem by removing the trusted center and secure setup.
Since the Ring Signature scheme was introduced, many practical schemes have been designed
based on the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), such as the  trapdoor technique. Generally speak-
ing, there are four kinds of Ring Signature schemes: Trapdoor Ring Signature, Linkable Ring Signa-
ture, Anonymity Revocable Ring Signature, and Deniable Ring Signature.
In order to provide anonymity in Smart Contract Token transactions, the Ring Signature scheme
based on ECC is implemented in Wanchain.
There are three parts to the Ring Signature scheme. Details are as below, taking the signer (P,x) as
an example:




WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD                                                       21
GEN：Get the public parameters. The signer generates a public key set including n members from
the world state through the function GeneratePublicKeySet( ) with the public key as a parameter:
publickeyset=GeneratePublicKeySet(P)
The signer makes a key image I by invoking GenerateKeyImage( ) with the public key and private
key:
I=GenerateKeyImage((P,x))
SIG：Generate the ring signature. The signer generates the ring signature of message m through
GenerateRingSignature( ) with publickeyset, I and x:
ringsig=GenerateRingSignature(m,publickeyset,I,x)
VER：Verify the ring signature. The signer verifies the ring signature of message m through
VerifyRingSignature( ) which returns true or false with publickeyset, I and ringsig:
�lag=VerifyRingSignature(m,publickeyset,I,ringsig)
If the flag is true, the ring signature is valid. Otherwise it`s invalid.
In the Ring Signature scheme, the key image and ring signature can not be matched with the signer
who is among the publickeyset. Anyone can verify whether the signature is valid or not, but no one
is able to identify the signer.

4.4.3  Privacy Protection Transaction Flow
Alice wants to send some tokens to Carl in the smart contract whose address is SCAddress. Alice`s
main account is (A,B) with main private key (a,b). Carl`s main account is (C,D) with the main
private key (c,d). Alice has a sub-account Onetime_account1 with the private key sk1 in the smart
contract. The transaction flow is as follows:
Alice sends a transaction:
Step1： Alice generates an one-time account for Carl with his main account:
Onetime_account2=OTA_GenerateAccount((C,D))
Step2： Alice generates the signature for the transaction data in the smart contract through Gen-
erateSignature( ) with sk1 and makes the final data Payload:
sig=GenerateSignature(Onetime_account1,Onetime_account2,value,nonce)
Payload=(Onetime_account1,Onetime_account2,value,nonce,sig)
Step3： Alice generates the public key set:
publickeyset＝GeneratePublicKeySet(A)
Step4： Alice generates the key image and makes the transaction message m:
I=GenerateKeyImage((A,a))
m=(publickeyset,SC_Address,Payload)
Step5： Alice generates the ring signature and makes the final transaction data:
ringsig=GenerateRingSignature(m,publickeyset,I,a)
transaction=(publickeyset,SCAddress,Payload,I,ringsig)
Step6： Alice broadcasts transaction on the Wanchain.
The Validator verifies a transaction:
Step1： The Validator receives transaction and makes the transaction data m to verify the ring
signature:
m=(publickeyset,SC_Address,Payload)
�lag=VerifyRingSignature(m,publickeyset,I,ringsig)




WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD                                                          23
Step2： If flag is true, the Validator goes to step 3. Otherwise the transaction is invalid and thrown
out.
Step3：  The Validator invokes the smart contract with Payload as a parameter. Then the smart
contract verifies the signature in Payload and executes the transfer.
After step 3, the transaction is committed on Wanchain. Carl scans the sub-accounts with his scan-
key and recognizes that Onetime_account2 belongs to himself. Then he gets the private key for
Onetime_account2 with his main private key. Therefore he takes the tokens of Value.

Appendix: Glossary of Terms
Chain ID: The chain identifier in Wanchain’s registry. OriChainID is used to mark the original chain
in transactions.
Cross-Chain Transaction: An asset transfer between two different blockchains (which means
transfer-in or -out of the original chain.) When an asset on one chain is transferred to another
chain, the total amount of the assets in the two ledgers stays unchanged, which will not cause any
inflation or deflation.
Homogeneous Chain: Either a public or   private chain developed based on Wanchain, which
contains the same cross-chain protocol and asset cross-chain mapping methods, and can be inte-
grated with Wanchain seamlessly for two-way asset transfers.
Inclusive Finance: Providing affordable financial services to disadvantaged and low-income
segments of society.
ICO(Initial Coin Offering): An initial coin offering (ICO) is a means of crowdfunding the release of a new
cryptocurrency. Generally, tokens for the new cryptocurrency are sold to raise money for technical
development before the cryptocurrency is released. Unlike an initial public offering (IPO), acquisition of
the tokens does not grant ownership in the company developing the new cryptocurrency.
Locked Account: The account to lock the assets transferred out of the chain.
Mapping Token (MT): The tokens on Wanchain corresponding to the original assets.
OriAccount: The account for the original chain that initiated the cross-chain transactions. For
example, the OriAccount of Alice is written as OriAccount(Alice).
Private Chain: A blockchain network with limited openness and decentralization compared with a
public chain, where authorization under specific rules is required for a new node to join the network.
Public Chain: A blockchain network fully open and decentralized, where any participants can join
the network as long as they follow the protocol of the public chain.




WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD                                                               29
Storeman: A Wanchain node that holds the key shares of locked accounts, uses the key shares to
generate signature shares and combine them into complete signatures, and carries out other oper-
ations on locked accounts.
Token Locked Flag (TLF): During the process of asset locking, Wanchain nodes verify the transac-
tion OriTx on the original chain and broadcasts the TLF consensus results to other nodes.
Token Unlocked Flag (TUF): During the process of asset unlocking, Wanchain nodes verify the
transaction OriTx on the original chain and broadcasts the TUF consensus results to other nodes.
Validator: The blockchain node used in packaging and verifying the transactions. Wanchain’s verifica-
tion nodes are divided into three categories: the general verification nodes (Validators), the cross-chain
transaction proof nodes (Vouchers), and the locked account management nodes (Storemen).
Voucher: A Wanchain verification node that is responsible for verifying whether the assets on the
original chain are locked or unlocked for cross-chain transactions.
WAN Account: An account maintained by Wanchain’s Validators to initiate transactions on Wan-
chain and deploy or call smart contracts.
Wanchain: A public blockchain referred to in this white paper, including distributed ledger, smart
contract, cross-chain protocol and other contents, which can achieve the cross-chain transactions,
privacy protection for token transactions and other functions.
Wanchain Cross-Chain Protocol: The communication specifications for Wanchain cross-chain
transactions (WIP for short), which includes Wanchain Cross-Chain Transaction Requests (WITx-
Req), Token Locked Flag (TLF), Token Unlocked Flag (TUF) and Mapping Token (MT):
Wanchain Cross-Chain Transaction Request  (WITxReq): A package of information, which
includes two parts - the Cross-Chain Transaction Request (InterTxReq) and the Origin Chain Trans-
action (OriTx). If the original chain is“  BTC”, then it will be written as OriTx(BTC). If the original
chain is the Wanchain, then it will be written as OriTx(WAN). For the public chain, OriTx is struc-
tured as the public chain transaction data format,   and the wallet uses OriTx to initiate the asset
transfer to Wanchain’s locked account on the original chain. Wanchain and the homogeneous
chain can construct a transaction UnlockedOriTx in accordance with the original chain transaction
data format. An OriTx is used to lock the original chain assets. An UnlockedOriTx is used to unlock
the original chain assets.
