The Burst Dymaxion
An Arbitrary Scalable, Energy Efficient and Anonymous Transaction Network Based on Colored Tangles
Seán Gauld1*, Franz von Ancoina, Robert Stadler2
Abstract
We describe the concept and implementation of a proposed layer to the Burstcoin cryptocurrency called “The Burst
Dymaxion”. This layer implements an arbitrary scalable, energy efficient and anonymous transaction network based
on colored tangles. Tangles are DAGs that can be seen as generalization of the blockchain. Coloring is a simple
tagging technique used in cryptocurrencies to allow for coexistence of various instances of a class in a common data
context. The Burstcoin network has several unique properties that make it our premier choice for implementation:
its Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) consensus algorithm is energy efficient, fair and anti-centralistic, the blockchain is very
compact and implements data scrubbing to reduce blockchain bloat and it has smart contracts. The coin has over 3
years of heritage and a community to bootstrap with, yet it is small enough to allow for significant improvements
without a long and paralyzing scaling debate. The original Burstcoin blockchain is used as underlying layer to open
and close an arbitrary number of general purpose transaction channels, similar to the Lightning Network proposal
of Bitcoin, but using IOTA-like tangles for propagation and verification. Each of these channels is not limited in
terms of capacity and number of transactions. This concept takes the best traits of the original Burstcoin, IOTA,
Monero, ZCash and the newest Bitcoin proposals to create a currency suitable for truly global use. It allows e.g.
banks, clearing houses, remittance processors and virtually all other market participants to use quasi-private, yet
decentral and trustless transaction channels with desired properties.

protocol is called the Lightning Network (LN).1 It is basically
a network of two-party ledger entries for participants who have
subscribed to a bidirectional payment channel. While a LN
solves many of the problems associated with high transaction
volume, micropayments and their cost, it is not a silver bullet.
E.g. it does quite little to increase the limits on the number of
concurrent users.[3]
Dymaxion is a term that Richard Buckminster Fuller as-
sociated with much of his work.  It is a portmanteau of the
words dynamic, maximum, and tension and sums up the goal
of his study, "maximum gain of advantage from minimal energy
input."
We use this term for the Burst Dymaxion to honor the
achievements and influence of this true generalist and also be-
cause the geodesic dome - a structure Fuller helped to popular-
ize - has very similar properties to what is proposed in this paper
for transaction propagation: Elements of the dome - while each
limited in resilience - distribute mechanical stress throughout
the whole structure, making geodesic domes able to withstand
very heavy loads for their size. In our proposal, the Dymaxion
is a set of tangle-based lightning networks, each single one used
for propagating transactions. Each single of these networks
distributes “transactional stress” among its whole network of
participating nodes, allowing for arbitrary scalability. The more
nodes participate, the higher the transactional capacity of each
of the currently active networks becomes. As any number of
these tangle-based LNs can co-exist at the same time, we speak
of Dymaxion layers (DL).
We therefore present nothing short of an energy-efficient
cryptocurrency that is able to sustain the total global load of
non-cash transactions.

paper suggests there being a hidden PoW in the validation
process:
For a node to issue a valid transaction, the node
must solve a cryptographic puzzle similar to those
in the Bitcoin blockchain.  This is achieved by
finding a nonce such that the hash of that nonce
concatenated with some data from the approved
transaction has a particular form.
The “incentive to participate” for a node (assume a node
has no need to perform transactions, so why should it validate
other transactions) is achieved by nodes keeping statistics on
their peers, e.g. how many new transactions are received from
a neighbor.  If one particular node is “too lazy”, it will be
dropped by its neighbors. Therefore, even if a node does not
issue transactions, and hence has no direct incentive to share
new transactions that approve its own transaction, it still has
incentive to participate.

1.5  Blockchain Binding with ACCTs
Atomic Cross-Chain Trading (ACCT) is a mechanism, where
two (or more) parties own coins in separate cryptocurrencies,
and want to exchange them without having to trust a third party.
The term “atomic” here means indivisible, and refers to the fact
that sending coins on one chain and sending other coins on the
other chain cannot be performed independent of each other.
If these transactions could be performed independent of
each other, then while one party could fulfil their side of the
bargain and send some coins on one chain, the other party
would have the option of going back on his end of the bargain
and simply not following through with the protocol, ending up
with both coins.
A decentral exchange where two parties, A and B, want to
exchange tokens can be based on the following process:5

The Burst Dymaxion — 7/23
2.1  Dymaxion Tangle vs. IOTA Tangle
While DAGs have been used as part of graph theory for several
decades now and are mathematically well understood today,
their use in cryptocurrencies as generalization of the blockchain
is a novelty.
We are convinced of the advantages tangles bring to ques-
tions of scalability and decentral design, but not every aspect
of the current iri (IOTA reference implementation) seems to be
the best possible design choice.[12]
Our biggest concern is the cryptographic hash function used
in IOTA: Curl. The IOTA vulnerability report[13] has shown
already practical signature forgery attacks and while IOTA no
longer uses the Curl hash function to hash transactions as part of
the IOTA signing process, Curl is still used for other purposes
in IOTA.
Similarly disturbing seems the claim of one of the IOTA
founders to have placed that vulnerability into Curl on purpose,
to be able to shut down copycats.  Even leaving the ethical
aspect aside - publishing IOTA source under GPL3 license
and allegedly placing a cryptographic vulnerability in its core
hash function - experience shows, that control over backdoors
                                                                     and vulnerabilities seldom remains in the “right hands”. By

4.2  Spamming and DoS Scenarios
Transactions on-tangle are free from fees. If they were truly
zero-cost transactions, there would be nothing at stake for some
attacker who would like to issue a huge amount of transactions
for some own benefit (spamming) or to simply congest the
network and hinder other transactions to be validated (DoS). In
the worst case, the attacker could amass a processing power that
would allow him to execute a whole class of majority attacks
with dire consequences to the network as such.                       Figure 10. Node discovery at reference point

5.2  Adoption Process
Burst has been around since 2014, yet it is still small enough to
allow for significant improvements without a long and paralyz-
ing scaling debate. It is natural if cryptocurrencies with large
market capitalization have to be very conservative with their
changes to the code base given the amounts at stake.
While Burst is more flexible in this aspect, as a cryptocur-
rency there are certain principles development must adhere to.
Changes to the code base must have the approval of the major-
ity of users, which in this case are wallet/node operators (not
miners). Blindly forking the coin can result in community split
and is undesireable in general.
Establishing The Burst Dymaxion will be an incremental
process consisting of the implementation of several Burst CIPs
(see section C - partially C). Each of these steps will carefully
adhere to a well defined and transparent process with evident
benefits resulting from its adoption.
Because the Burst Dymaxion is a layer on top of the Burst
blockchain, virtually all essential components of Burst will re-
main unchanged and if there is a change, backward-compatibility

Dymaxion
The Burst Dymaxion is not only the most significant update to
the Burst cryptocurrency, it is the biggest technological update
any cryptocurrency has ever received.  Each of the compo-
nents features a full outstanding protocol feature by itself, so
establishing the Dymaxion as a whole needs to be done as an
incremental process, split up into several separate CIPs:
•  adding ring signatures library
•  adding zk-SNARKs library
•  adding parts of the IOTA iri
•  adding ACCT (ACTT) templates

Using Feistel ciphers allows for individualization, yet loss-

cipher being of same length as the original data, paving the way
for a dual-use Proof-of-Capacity consensus.

Similar to the current Burst mining process, a scoop would
define the starting point in the data layout (index in the lowest
level). The algorithm would traverse the RB tree of 64-byte
scoops, where the path decision (start, then red or black for
each level) would simply be defined by the bit sequence of the
previous block-id 1=B, 0=R.
A maximum of 64 steps allows for a maximum PoC3 plot
file size of 2 YiB (yobibyte). The values along the traversed path
would be concatenated and hashed. All values along the path as
well as their hash value are then broadcast to the network, where
any nodes can take over the validation of the submitted data.
As the length of the path defines the size of the underlying plot
