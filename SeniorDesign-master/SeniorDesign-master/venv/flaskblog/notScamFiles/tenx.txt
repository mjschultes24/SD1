TenX
“At TenX we work on making any blockchain asset spendable
instantly”
What is TenX
When we as the co-founders of TenX got together to start this company, it was our vision to have
assets on the blockchain be not only available to industry insiders, but rather something that can
be used by any individual user in the “real world”.
Additionally, with the emergence of more and more different tokens, a growing number of users
and businesses truly struggle to leverage on the existing infrastructure to make this inter-
connectedness of physical and virtual platforms become a reality.
At TenX, we strive to offer the user access to as large as possible a range of blockchain assets at
a maximum degree of convenience, while adhering to the highest security standards in the
ecosystem.
We are able to do this by connecting blockchains, leveraging on the COMIT network, including
the  COMIT  Routing  Protocol  and  the  Cross-chain  Payment  Channels,  which  works  in  a
completely trustless, instantaneous and low-cost manner. For further information on the COMIT
network, including the COMIT Routing Protocol and the Cross-chain Payment Channels, please
refer                                                                                                 to   the   whitepaper   in   respect   thereof,   accessible   at

To the end-user, we offer the TenX Card, a debit (and, in time to come, credit) card, with an
accompanying TenX Wallet, a mobile wallet that can be funded not only with Bitcoin (BTC),
Ether (ETH), and Dash (DASH) as currently possible, but also with virtually any blockchain
asset in time to come. TenX payment facilities which include the physical and virtual debit card
can be used in almost  200 countries at over  36 million points of acceptance today. This
is possible as we have card issuance partnerships with major credit card companies.
Moreover, users and businesses can exchange their blockchain assets seamlessly from one
user to another in a decentralized manner, removing any risk that is usually associated with
current centralized solutions.
Company Background
When we founded our company in mid-2015, we chose Singapore as our main base. These were
the main considerations we had:
●  Singapore is a major and globally recognized financial hub
●  The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is, in our view, open to the development of
start-ups in the FinTech industry
●  Southeast Asia is a market with huge growth potential
●  According to the World Bank Group,1 50% of the population is still underbanked in
Southeast Asia, China and India
●  Singapore is globally connected and recognized, which would greatly assist in business
development and expansion to Europe and the Americas

The TenX Wallet
The TenX Wallet is the major game changer as it enables users to spend their blockchain assets
through their smartphone or a physical debit card at over 36 million points of acceptance online
and offline. The TenX App (called the TenX - Blockchain Asset Wallet) is downloadable for
free on Android and we aim to launch the WebApp and iOS versions from July and August 2017
respectively                                                                                       (with  the  specific  launch  dates  being  subject  to  achievement  of  the  relevant
milestones in the TenX Initial Token Sale, as explained below).
Once the user has downloaded the TenX App, he simply enters his phone number and email
address to set up an account.

team@tenx.tech

A multi-currency wallet will be created automatically, which the user can then fund with
different cryptocurrencies. The private key to each TenX Wallet is currently secured via an
industry-standard hot & cold storage solution. By the end of 2017, we will directly link the TenX
Wallet to the COMIT network, thereby allowing users to store their own private keys.
The cryptocurrencies do NOT need to be converted to fiat money until an actual transaction
happens, in which case such conversion will be conducted in real-time. The user can choose
between different blockchain assets as a source of payment within the TenX App. Further, the
user can conveniently convert a wide range of blockchain assets such as BTC, ETH and DASH
from one to another by simply using his TenX Wallet.

team@tenx.tech

The user can choose to order a TenX Card, a virtual and/or physical debit (and in time to come,
credit) card, directly within the TenX App. As a security measure, we allow a user to lock and
unlock his card through the TenX App. This makes our system more secure than traditional
credit and debit card systems.
The user can withdraw his blockchain assets and transfer them to another cryptocurrency wallet
without incurring any fees for such transfer at any time.
Product advantages
●  Multi-asset (any blockchain asset compatible with and accepted by the TenX Wallet)
●  Assets stay in cryptocurrency
●  Best available foreign exchange and transaction fees (with no other charges)
●  Decentralized and trustless storage
●  Global access to  36 million points of acceptance online and offline in close to  200
countries
●  Any user from non-US countries can sign up now (sign-ups in the US to follow by the
end of 2017)
●  Users  earn  a  0.1%  reward  for  every  purchase  they  make.  This  incentive  will  be
transferred to the user in form of PAY tokens initially on a monthly basis, which
additionally gives them the opportunity to become token holders and further benefit from
a potential value upside of the tokens (see the section below entitled “TenX Initial Token
Sale” for further details). Going forward, TenX aims to distribute the reward more
frequently, with a target of reward distribution on an hourly basis

COMIT Integration
→  We  welcome  feedback  from  blockchain  and  tech-savvy  readers  on  this  part  of  the
Whitepaper.
Payment Flow
TenX Card holders can use any blockchain asset to buy products and services at any of over 36
million merchants that accept global credit cards. We use Cross-chain Payment Channels of the
COMIT network to allow the user to settle incoming payment requests from the credit card
networks in real-time.
The following is an illustration of how a payment is made in real-time from a user’s TenX
Wallet and settled on the credit card network
1.  User pays at the merchant using his virtual or physical TenX Card
2.  The card network will send an authorization request to our servers for the purchase
amount
3.  TenX will send an invoice through the COMIT network to the user
4.  The user will then choose which blockchain asset to use for the payment and send the
correct amount to TenX through the COMIT network
5.  Upon receiving the corresponding amount for the invoice, TenX will authorize the
payment to the merchant
Copyright 2017 @ TenX PTE LTD
team@tenx.tech
21 of 51




To allow for real-time transactions, the user will need to configure his TenX Wallet with his
preferred default blockchain asset as the payment source and set a spending limit. This only takes
seconds and the user retains full control over his funds at any given time.
Fee Disbursement Flow
For every card transaction a merchant accepts, the merchant pays  0.5-3% in the form of a
merchant discount fee. This fee is then split among his bank, also called the acquiring bank, the
card scheme and the issuing bank. The fee that is paid to the issuing bank is called the
interchange fee. Traditionally this fee is plain profit for the issuer, but often is also used to give
rewards to the user in form of air miles or similar benefits. At TenX, we reward our users with
PAY tokens on every purchase to allow them to become a token holder. Subsequently, PAY
token holders will receive an incentive of 0.5% of the entire payment volume on the TenX
payment platform initially on a monthly basis. TenX aims to distribute the reward in shorter
periods of time in the future, with a target of hourly reward distribution.

Cross-chain Payment Channel of COMIT network
We use Cross-chain Payment Channels and the COMIT Routing Protocol to allow our users to
use their blockchain assets in real-time in the real world. TenX will be the first liquidity provider
in the network to offer real-world payments. By using the COMIT Routing Protocol, a user can
use any blockchain asset for his payments.
For further information on the COMIT network, including the COMIT Routing Protocol and the
Cross-chain Payment Channels, please refer to the whitepaper in respect thereof, accessible at
http://www.comit.network/doc/COMIT%20white%20paper%20v1.0.2.pdf.
Why build on top of COMIT?
Similar to the way the internet added value by enabling connectivity between local intranets, the
COMIT network adds value to individual blockchains by creating connectivity between them.
The COMIT network is the internet of blockchains. COMIT therefore, will not have to be
created by any individual entity. Instead, it will automatically operate as the ecosystem will
strive to connect separate blockchains.

TenX Initial Token Sale
What is an Initial Token Sale?
An Initial Token Sale (ITS) is an event in which a new cryptocurrency project sells part of its
cryptocurrency tokens to early adopters and enthusiasts in exchange for funding. For the party
offering the tokens for sale, this has become a well-documented and well-respected way to raise
funds to upscale an existing product or service.
The sale by the Distributor of PAY tokens in connection with an Initial Token Sale (the “TenX
Initial Token Sale”) to you as a purchaser thereof, will be subject to and governed by the T&Cs
- which is a separate document setting out the terms and conditions of the agreement as between
the  Distributor  and  you  in  relation  to  the  TenX  Initial  Token  Sale.  In  the  event  of  any
inconsistencies between the T&Cs and this Whitepaper, the former shall prevail.
The Distributor will be an affiliate of TenX, and will deploy all proceeds of sale of PAY Tokens
in connection with the TenX Initial Token Sale to fund TenX’s cryptocurrency project, businesses
and operations.
Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we” or “us” in connection with the TenX
Initial Token Sale shall be construed as references to the Distributor.
The TenX Initial Token Sale is hereby announced on:
June 24th 2017
9PM Singapore Time (UTC+8)/

Why an Initial Token Sale?
Even though TenX already has a live, multi-asset cryptocurrency wallet with the TenX Wallet,
the leap forward with integration with the COMIT network is anticipated to be more than just a
straight-line progression. Bringing developers, marketing personnel, a legal team, designers and
many other talented people on board will require additional funds. Offering an Initial Token Sale
instead of a traditional venture capital round enables the community to participate in TenX’s
success story, rather than limiting it to a small, selected number of traditional venture capital
funds. Furthermore, by giving PAY tokens to users of the TenX Wallet and the TenX Card,
whenever they use the TenX Card, they will benefit from TenX’s future success. An Initial
Token Sale is fast, transparent and efficient for exactly this purpose.
General Token Sale Overview
On June 24th 2017 starting at 9PM Singapore Time (see the applicable commencement times in
more timezones above), we will offer 51% of all PAY tokens to be created for purchase by the
public in the TenX Initial Token Sale under the ticker symbol PAY. A further 29% of all PAY
tokens  to  be  created  will  be  retained  by  TenX  and/or  the  Distributor  for  distribution  for
community  initiatives,  business  development,  academic  research,  education  and  market
expansion, to name just a few. The remaining  20% of PAY tokens to be created will be
distributed to TenX’s founders, employees and early investors as an incentive to ensure long
term alignment of interests and commitment to the tokens and their future value. Further details
of the distribution of tokens are set out below.
Each PAY token will be sold for 1/350 ETH, meaning 1 ETH will give you 350 PAY tokens.
Other accepted cryptocurrencies will be converted live in ETH. There is a minimum purchase
amount of 10 PAY tokens per purchase.
We will accept a maximum (fixed limit) of 200,000 ETH, for purchase of PAY tokens in the
TenX Initial Token Sale. The PAY tokens created for such maximum amount contributed will in
turn represent 51% of all PAY tokens. Should this amount be reached before the end of the sale
on  24 July  2017,  8.59pm Singapore Time  (UTC+8), which is  4 weeks after the token sale
commencement date, we will cut off the sale.
In the case of an amount of contribution falling below such maximum amount, the percentage of
51% of all tokens will be adjusted accordingly, with the difference between such lower amount
and the maximum amount being reserved for future token sales.

Holders of PAY tokens will receive 0.5% of the aggregate payment volume that is spent by all
users with the TenX Card on a monthly basis initially. The payments to the token holders will be
paid in ETH (Ether), or the closest equivalent thereof in the case where ETH is replaced by
another cryptocurrency in the future. Going forward, TenX will strive to distribute the rewards in
shorter time periods, with a target of hourly reward distribution.
Users of the TenX Card will receive 0.1% from each transaction they make with the TenX Card
initially on a monthly basis, as an incentive in the form of PAY tokens (similar to how users are
rewarded with air-miles or other forms of cash back in kind for usage of existing cards today).
This incentive for users of the TenX Card will have a great benefit to existing token holders
since this recurring redistribution of tokens will create an additional demand for tokens in the
market. This additional reward for users in the form of PAY tokens is bought on the open market
and will create price support.
Please note that we will not create any new PAY tokens after the TenX Initial Token Sale.
Important Milestones based on different amounts of funding
received in connection with the TenX Initial Token Sale
If the fund raising in connection with the TenX Initial Token Sale reaches a minimum of at least
50,000 ETH, TenX will be able to offer TenX’s services soon on mobile platforms in addition to
Android, including iOS and WebApp. Further, it is envisaged that TenX will explore the
development and operation of a multi-card platform to expand blockchain assets spending
coverage via further issuing partnerships with issuers such as Unionpay and American Express,
in addition to the current issuing partnerships already established.

Moreover, funding at this level would enable TenX to add and support more and more different
cryptocurrencies and tokens to offer our users the opportunity to use an even wider variety of
cryptocurrencies in real-world transactions. Integrating more blockchain assets for compatibility
with the TenX Wallet will greatly benefit the user by making more and more of their tokens or
other blockchain assets spendable, as easy as spending a $100 bill.

If the TenX Initial Token Sale generates another 50,000 ETH, these funds will enable TenX to
ramp up the development of the COMIT network and TenX will be able to fully integrate it with
the TenX Wallet by Q2 2018.
The COMIT network is a very technically complicated and resource-intensive project. It will
take a lot of resources to establish and finalise it, and it will be a long way until it is live and
operational. However, the COMIT network will fundamentally revolutionise the blockchain
world.  In  an  unprecedented  manner,  it  potentially  connects  different  blockchains  without
introducing new hurdles and complications in between them.
The COMIT network will completely change the way the business is conducted and how we
understand  today’s  blockchain  ecosystem.  On  the  COMIT  network,  a  plethora  of  new
applications, functions and services will be built to create a quantum leap for the blockchain
industry.

With the next 50,000 ETH, TenX will be able to apply for a banking license to create an even
better user experience and to gradually integrate fiat currencies into the TenX Wallet and TenX
Card, alongside all the cryptocurrencies to come.
Such banking licence will give TenX and token holders the benefit of significant increases in
revenues from interchange fees and improved control over card fees, card limits, royalty fees as
well as loyalty points programmes such as airlines.
Obtaining a banking licence is a strategic trojan horse into the fiat currency world, and convince
late adopters and late majority users to begin using cryptocurrencies. TenX intends to offer
normal fiat deposits, which will be fully insured by governments of different jurisdictions. TenX
will be able to issue fiat currency-linked tokens on the blockchain for all users and it will be fully
backed by state guarantees. This will allow TenX to become a major systemic hub and one of the
most important financial institutions connecting blockchain assets and the fiat currency world.
A wide variety of institutions ranging from exchanges to blockchain businesses can benefit from
TenX as bridge between these two worlds.
The US is one of the most important financial markets, which requires dedication of legal and
compliance resources. The capital raised will help TenX build global coverage unlike any other
company.

To start a decentralized exchange we require liquidity, so payments received which are above
150,000 ETH will be used as liquidity for the COMIT network.
Any successful exchange requires liquidity to commence and maintain operations. This will
allow the COMIT network to have a best in class liquidity and spread. Only with that foundation
we can attract more users and therefore more transaction volume. The more diversified the range
of cryptocurrencies and tokens which the Distributor can accept as payment in the TenX Initial
Token Sale, the more liquidity there will be for the COMIT network.

Overview of Token Structure
The Distributor will offer 51% of all PAY tokens to be created for purchase by the public in the
TenX Initial Token Sale while a further 29% of the PAY tokens to be created will be retained by
TenX and/or the Distributor to be distributed for purposes including community initiatives,
business development, academic research, education and market expansion. The Distributor
considers this is testament to the fact that TenX wants to be open and inclusive of the community
at large, which TenX perceives as TenX’s most valuable asset. The Distributor considers it is a
strong signal of trust in TenX if the community owns more than half of the PAY tokens from the
very beginning.
At the same time, TenX feels that it is essential that the interests of TenX be aligned with those
of the ecosystem in the long-term. In order to be able to support long term growth in a
sustainable way, founders, early backers and the development team of TenX will be rewarded
with the remaining 20% of tokens in exchange for their efforts and resources contributed to the
development of the TenX Wallet and the COMIT network.

Funding Breakdown
As mentioned above, a certain part of the PAY tokens will be retained by TenX and/or the
Distributor after the TenX Initial Token Sale to ensure the long-term alignment of interests. It is
important for TenX that the community understands how these funds will be spent. The pie-chart
below illustrates how such PAY tokens that are retained by TenX and/or the Distributor after the
conclusion of the TenX Initial Token Sale will be allocated.
●  Integration of the COMIT network: The COMIT network will be the backbone to operate
the TenX Wallet in a decentralised, instant and true multi-asset manner. The largest
portion of our funds will go towards integrating our TenX App and the TenX Wallet with
the COMIT network
●  Marketing and sales: The TenX team is driven by some of the best marketing experts in
our team. TenX will continue to run its marketing efforts on a very lean, cost-efficient
basis and keep user acquisition costs one of the lowest in the industry. For further details,
please refer to the section entitled “Go-to market strategy” below
●  Multi-platform support: TenX will continuously support and introduce new features, user
interfaces and language support for the TenX Wallet on iOS, WebApp and Android
●  Development  fund:  A  small  portion  of  the  funds  will  be  dedicated  for  strategic
partnerships to enhance the revenue stream for our PAY token holders. This could be, for
example, in the form of co-branding and co-marketing initiatives with other companies
Copyright 2017 @ TenX PTE LTD
team@tenx.tech
43 of 51




●  Administration and operations: TenX is running a very lean, cost-effective start-up and
will continue to do so in the future. Being in the blockchain ecosystem and adhering to
the highest standards, there are some operational costs associated with accounting and
administrative overheads to take care of the business processes needed for a growing
international business
●  Legal: One of our primary focuses when starting this company in early 2015 was to
establish a solid legal foundation for TenX. We have been in direct contact with the
MAS, have built our in-house legal & compliance team with the help of Paypal and are
deeply connected in Singapore to raise awareness for this amazing new technology in the
legal world. In particular, TenX has engaged the legal services of Dentons Rodyk &
Davidson LLP to advise on the TenX Initial Token Sale
Based on TenX’s earlier successful USD 1 million seed round, TenX is confident to complete a
successful Series A fundraising exercise in the near future. Depending on whether the funding
goal is reached in the TenX Initial Token Sale, this can be between 9 to 24 months from now.
In TenX’s opinion, the later TenX raises its Series A, the higher its valuation will be. This will
also have a positive knock-on effect on holders of PAY tokens.
Important notice once again: TenX and/or the Distributor will not create any new PAY tokens
after the TenX Initial Token Sale.

TenX Initial Token Sale Procedure
To participate in the PAY token sale, we accept the following currencies:
●  Ethereum (ETH)
●  Bitcoin (BTC)
●  ERC20 Tokens
●  And many more (for the full list of accepted cryptocurrencies, please refer to our website
at https://tokensale.tenx.tech/)
The tokens will be delivered to the purchaser after the purchase. Transferability will start from
the first day of trading, which is planned to start anytime from August 2017.
Usage of Currencies
For TenX it is super important to be inclusive of as many crypto-communities as possible, as
TenX strongly believes that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
For this reason, the Distributor will strive to offer the possibility to allow contributions of as
many different tokens and cryptocurrencies as possible for the TenX Initial Token Sale. The
Distributor’s goal is to unite as many different crypto-communities in support of TenX as
possible and provide them with a platform to spend their tokens and coins using our product. It
was a lot of work, but TenX has managed to find secure ways to accept such a wide variety of
tokens and cryptocurrencies.
As an additional incentive for the community, when an equivalent of 2000 ETH in respect of
cryptocurrencies or tokens in the TenX Initial Token Sale has been received as payments, TenX
will dedicate our resources to the integration of such additional cryptocurrencies or tokens such
that they are accepted and compatible with the TenX Card and TenX Wallet to allow you to use
such cryptocurrencies or tokens for any payments with the TenX Wallet. For example, if we
receive an equivalent of 2000 ETH or more in Litecoins, we will strive to integrate Litecoin for
compatibility with the TenX Wallet.

Equivalent of ETH                                                                                      Incentive
Contribution of tokens and cryptocurrencies                                                            Such cryptocurrency or token will be
in the equivalent value of 2000 ETH                                                                    integrated in the TenX Wallet and the user
will be able to spend it directly via the TenX
Card
For each token and cryptocurrency on the list above, you will receive PAY tokens in exchange,
just as if you bought them with Ether or Bitcoin instead. The exchange rate that will be used to
calculate this will be based on the rate of the currency or token you would like to use vis-a-vis
Ethereum.
For example, if users buy PAY tokens in the equivalent value of 2000 ETH or more in ZCash,
TenX will integrate ZCash in its TenX Wallet and users will be able to spend their tokens
directly with the TenX Card and the TenX App.
