The Future of Social Networks
version 1.2.1




Let’s take back the social network...
While it is generally expected that professional content owners such as singers,
songwriters, and other digital rights holders are able to monetize their content,
content creators outside of this traditional model do not benefit from the economic
value they generate in social networks. Increasingly, valuable content is generated
from all walks of life, through video blogs, audio/podcasting, live-streams, and the
like. We believe that everyone who adds value to the network should benefit from
their work.
To realize this future where all participants in the social media ecosystem can be
rewarded for their contributions to their social network, we are very excited to launch
the Mithril (MITH) token. Whether you are a popular celebrity, admired livestreamer,
or everyday user, you can participate in network value that you help create through
social mining on Mithril.
MITH tokens can be earned through social mining across accepted social networks,
starting with the launch of the Lit platform.
I welcome you to join me and the Mithril team as we take back the social network.

Introduction
Mithril is a decentralized social media platform on the Ethereum Blockchain. Mithril
will integrate into new and existing social media networks to reward content creators
for contributions to the network - we call this Social Mining.
Mithril (MITH) will leverage blockchain technology to ensure that transactions are
secure and safe for all participants. This technology revolves around decentralized
data storage that can record transactions between parties in a efficient, trustless,
and immutable manner.
MITH will launch as a utility token on Lit, an innovative social media platform that
addresses the needs of this current generation of users. This younger generation of
social media users seeks a platform that addresses both their needs as early crypto
adopters as well as their evolving needs in social media. Features such as instant
messaging, story feeds, and discovery of new friends are all built into Lit for launch.
Lit will enable Social Mining of MITH to reward users for contributing their personal
content to the network, and provide the Mithril Vault for its users to store, use, and
exchange MITH for BTC and ETH. Lit will seamlessly integrate into into major social
networks to help users more easily monetize their personal content.
With MITH tokens, users will be able to spend it across the MITH application
ecosystem, such as dating services, premium content channels, and live-stream
applications. The Mithril Merchant Network aims to allow retail acceptance of MITH
as a payment method, beginning with retailers in Taiwan and Hong Kong at launch.
The MITH network, armed with its user base of social influencers, will be a
highly-desirable customer base which Mithril Merchant Network partners will benefit
through a deep MITH integration.
Mithril is founded by the team behind 17 Media, with advisors from Pantera Capital,
Sora Ventures, QTUM Foundation, AMIS, and Blockstate.

Lit has been developed to fully integrate with the MITH token, and has laid out a
three-part plan to establish and grow Mithril’s network value:
1.      Drive network and user adoption for the Mithril platform.
2.      Develop a system of rewards and benefits for users and partners.
3.      Enable mobile wallet to spend MITH at both retail and online Mithril Merchants .
Lit will serve as the leading platform to illustrate the network value of a decentralized
contributor model and act as the cornerstone for future digital and social media
networks.
The Mithril team will assist in integrating the Mithril ecosystem into our launch
partner social media platforms and help bring their users into the Mithril network.

Mithril Solution Overview
Mithril Token
The Mithril token is an ERC-20 token.
The Mithril team has implemented exciting new features to help rebalance the
current social network ecosystem. We are implementing a new mining concept we
term “Social Mining”. Social Mining seeks to automate content monetization and will
equitably reward all content contributors with MITH.
Our decentralized model will give power back to the content creators, thus providing
incentive for content creators to deliver quality content and attract highly-influential
users and viewers. This is the genesis of the Mithril ecosystem. With the large influx
of quality users and viewers, we believe that the Mithril ecosystem will quickly
generate significant amounts of revenue for Mithril partners and their content
producers, thus making the Mithril network more sticky for both content creators as
well as Mithril Partners. This creates a virtuous cycle that enables sustainable
growth.
Another feature of the Mithril ecosystem is the Mithril Vault. Mithril partner platforms
and users can leverage this tool to track, maintain, and manage their MITH across
multiple networks. Ease of use and security is a priority for the Mithril Vault. We seek
to provide seamless integration to the Mithril Vault across all partner platforms.
5




Social Mining
A new concept that is integral in the new Mithril ecosystem is Social Mining. The idea
is simple. As users produces valuable, user-generated content on the network, they
will earn MITH via Social Mining. Their mining rewards will be directly linked to their
influence and success as a contributor on the network. The more network value they
bring to the platform, the more MITH they will earn. All mining efforts and rewards
will initially transact via the Ethereum Network.
35% of the total Mithril pool will be available for users to mine via Social Mining. For
the next several years, a total of 350 Million Mithril will be distributed to users of the
Mithril network through Social Mining. The Mithril quantity that is available for
discovery will be halved annually over the course of a predetermined number of
years. At the end of this mining period, all 350 Million Mithril will have been mined
and distributed. Social Mining will have distribution controls that will act similarly to
Bitcoin’s dynamic difficulty retargeting adjustments.
6




The above graph displays the Mithril distribution model via Social Mining. This model
awards early adoption of the Mithril token, as Social Mining rewards are reduced
exponentially. Initially, network growth will be driven via larger MITH mining rewards.
As Mithril user base and network scales, the usablity and usefulness of Mithril’s
network will increase accordingly, allowing the lower MITH reward to continue as an
effective incentive for Social Mining to continue.
All Social Mining transactions will be verified and secured via Ethereum smart
contracts, providing a safe and reliable infrastructure for Social Mining. All
transactions can be tracked and verified on the Ethereum blockchain, creating a
much-desired transparency for all users and partners on the Mithril network.
7




Below is the technical breakdown of Social Mining:
8




Social Mining Example
In this example, we have 3 users: David, Bob, and Carol. They are new users to
Mithril and have 0 MITH each. Over the span of one week, David contributes 4
stories to one of Mithril’s partner platforms and receives 400 views and 0 hearts, Bob
contributes 5 stories and receives 200 views with 80 hearts, and Carol contributes
nothing to the network. Using our social mining algorithm, while setting the current
per view weight at 1 and the per heart weight at 5, David will have mined 400 ore,
Bob at 600 ore, while Carol has mined 0 ore. Based on preset calculations, the total
Mithril Reward for this 1 week period was automatically determined to be 10000
MITH.   Based on the purity weight of the three miners, David will receive 4000 MITH,
Bob has earned 6000 MITH, while Carol will receive nothing.
9




Mithril Vault
The Mithril Vault will be an easy-to-use transaction system for each user and partner
platform to manage, secure, and spend their Mithril. We seek to lower the barrier of
entry for users of all platforms and allow for cross-platform integration of the Vault.
The Mithril Vault will feature reward estimation tools that can estimate a user's Mithril
reward based on their recent contributions. The reward estimation tools will show
users a rough estimate of their potential Social Mining Rewards.
10




Mithril Platform
The ultimate goal of the Mithril team is to become the best and most optimized
blockchain for social network applications. The first step to achieving this goal is to
integrate MITH into all major social networks. Mithril features are intended to be
leveraged across any major social media to give all users direct impact over their
social content ownership, thus awarding them for their work on any relevant social
network. Furthermore, we are exploring MITH acceptance on partner apps and
services, where MITH may be accepted as a form of social currency to pay for
premium features and services on these platforms.
The Mithril Integration Protocol is designed for seamless integrations between social
networks and the Mithril Ecosystem. Through this protocol, we intend to make
integration of the MITH token, Social Mining, Mithril Vault, Mithril Merchant Network,
and other Mithril features easy for major social networks.
As blockchain platforms continue to evolve, we intend to continually assess
platforms for their ability to support the best and most optimized social network
token. Scalability, transaction cost, and community support are the top metrics by
which we will measure platform viability. As Mithril evolves, we intend to keep close
watch on leading Ethereum scalability solutions such as Plasma, Raiden Network, as
well as platforms outside of Ethereum, such as EOS and Zilliqa. Finally, we intend to
explore the option of launching our own Mithril blockchain to best address the needs
of social network applications, swapping all ERC-20 MITH token holders onto our
mainnet tokens.
Mithril Merchant Network
In addition to having apps and services accept MITH as payment, we are also
working toward a broader merchant network across physical, brick-and-mortar retail
acceptance of MITH. Among the first retail partners that will accept MITH at launch is
inst.recycle1, Taiwan's largest celebrity vintage and used clothing retailer. To join the
Mithril merchant network, contact us at merchants@mith.io.

Lit: Launchpad for Decentralized Social Networks
Lit Overview
Globally, 2.46 billion people use social tools and networks to establish connections
and communities within the world around them. The frequent sharing of an
individual's life is considered normal and a major part of our always connected social
society.
Stories are a recent new social trend that has been making huge waves in the social
content world. Lit offers a feature-rich and well designed Stories platform that directly
integrates into the Mithril ecosystem. As users share their stories via Lit Stories,
users can be rewarded with Mithril tokens based on their stories impact and
influence across the network.
Stories Overview
Stories is a time sensitive sharing feature that gives content producers a way to
share small intimate glimpses of their life with their friends, family, and the general
public. Within 24 hours, the story will be automatically be removed from the platform.
Stories can consist of individual photos, slideshows, videos, posts, etc.
Users can choose to share their stories publicly or privately. This allows users to be
carefree about sharing their own life while maintaining their privacy at a level in
which they are most comfortable.
This sharing model was first implemented by Snapchat and has since been a leading
feature among top social media platforms.
Six months after the launch of Instagram’s stories feature, Instagram added 100
million additional users, and the platform grew to over 500 million active users.
Instagram stories had a huge growth impact on their platform and helped boost its
popularity. A surprising but also exciting statistic is that approximately one-third of
the stories that are actively followed are directly associated with business accounts,
which directly suggests that stories would be an excellent tool for businesses to
leverage for their digital marketing campaigns and goals.
12




Lit Camera / Video
Lit will directly integrate with mobile device cameras and apply advanced and
modern camera algorithms to give Lit users the tools and features to take the best
looking pictures.
In addition, Lit Video will connect directly with users’ cameras for feature-rich video
recording, providing all users the ability to record high-quality videos up to 10
seconds in length.
Lit will also provide superior filters, effects, and retouching options for beautiful
photo/video retouching and improvement options. The combination of technology
and post-effects will allow Lit users the capability of sharing and showcasing their life
through the best lens.
All Lit Camera and Videos can be directly posted to Lit features such as Stories,
Chat room, etc.
13




Lit Story Feed
The Story Feed will be the most active and important feature of Lit. The Story Feed
will allow users to have quick and easy access to stories across the social network.
The Story Feed will feature stories of Friends and Followed feeds and put them right
at the fingertips of Lit network users. Intuitive gestures and navigation will be
implemented to provide a seamless, fast, and simple user experience.
The community interaction functionality of the Story Feed is a top priority for our
team. We have given our story readers the ability to connect with their family,
friends, communities, and fan base with the addition of the heart and story message
feature implemented directly into the Story Feed. With fast and simple gestures, our
team focuses on allowing any user to be able to quickly access, share, and to give
and receive feedback on their stories feed.
14




Lit Chatroom
Lit will also feature an interactive chat system that can facilitate private conversations
between friends in addition to hosting groups, and community chat rooms. The Lit
Chat feature will allow for sharing of stories between friends, groups, and
communities.
15




Lit Discover
Lit Discover is a feature for those looking to connect with more people, groups, and
communities that share similar interests. It will feature news, business, media, and
celebrity story feeds based on the user's current trending interests calculated via
data collection algorithms or based on user selection.
This feature will also include Friends of Friends, Interests Groups, Category Feeds,
etc. in which Lit Discover feeds will cater to user interests and help facilitate a more
active and community enriched social life.
16




Lit Profile
The Lit Profile is the centerpiece of each user’s personal data, managing and storing
their current stories, shared stories, and saved user content. In addition to this
profile, all users can view their current Mithril availability and will help connect all
users to Mithril features such as Social Mining and the Mithril Wallet.
The Lit Public Profile will present user selected stories, content and data for the
general public to view and access. The public profile will be an engaging billboard for
users to have a user-customized filtered view of each's personal information.
17




Token Distribution
Token Exchange — 30%
Development Team — 5%
Our team is committed to long-term growth. Team tokens will vest over 4 years with
a one year cliff.
