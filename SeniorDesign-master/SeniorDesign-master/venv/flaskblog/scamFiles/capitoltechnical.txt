Capital Technologies & Research - Technical White Paper
Introduction
This technical whitepaper provides explanation
of  Capital  Technologies  &  Research’s  end-to-end
encryption model through blockchain.   We encrypt
our  users  communications  through  The  Signal
Protocol,  designed  by  Open  Whisper  Systems,  to
ensure an up to date solution without inventing the
wheel.
The  problem  in  the  today’s  usage  of  Open
Whispers Systems protocol is that Key Distribution
Center is centralized, so the risk of a MITM (Man in
the middle) attack, user metadata leak or server’s
hack is most likely to happen. Here we come up with
a solution, public keys of users are stored in the
blockchain where replacement is almost impossible,
making those attacks almost unfeasible.
Vulnerabilities
Main  vulnerability  is                                   51%  Proof  of  Work
network attack, that can reverse blockchain history
and replace users true keys with fake ones; and even
if  that  will  happen,  no  history  activity  can  be
recovered.

The second major vulnerability that can happen is
if a hacker intercepts enough messages, the private
key can be reconstructed back, gaining access to the
account, but not to the whole activity history behind.
Features
We  highlight  the  fact  that  no  activity  history
(messages or voice calls) can be recovered due to the
Double  Ratchet  algorithm  that  manages  ongoing
renewal and maintenance of short-lived session keys.
“Double Ratchet Algorithm - This algorithm is
self-healing  because  under  certain  conditions,  it
disables an attacker from accessing the clear-text of
messages                                                  ("the   communication")   after   having
compromised a session key. This condition is that
between  the  compromise  of  the  key  and  the
communication in question, there has been at least
one message which was not tampered with by the
attacker.  This  effectively  forces  the  attacker  to

Capital Technologies & Research - Technical White Paper
intercept  all  communication  between  the  honest
parties, since he loses access as soon as
one  uncompromised  message  is  passed  between
them”. This algorithm had been used for a long time
because it provides both full encryption of contents
on   the   entire   way   of   transport   as   well   as
authentication  of  the  remote  users  and  protection
against manipulation of messages.
Asynchronicity between users sessions is assured
by the blockchain technologies that use the Extended
Public Key to derive multiple public keys in order to
establish  a  session  between                              2  users.  This  allows
initialization  of  messaging  sessions  without  the
presence                                                    of                        other   party   (asynchronous
communication).

Capital Technologies & Research - Technical White Paper
The usage of triple Diffie-Hellman key exchange
(3-DH) as initial key exchange through blockchain
improves   the   deniability   properties   providing
anonymity, confidentiality, integrity, authentication,
participant   consistency,   destination   validation,
forward   secrecy,   backward   secrecy,   causality
preservation and message unlinkability.
An   user   renews   session   key   material   in
interaction  with  the  remote  peer  using  Diffie-
Hellman   ratchet   whenever   possible,   otherwise
independently by using a hash ratchet.

Node-to-node   Real-time   Transport   Protocol
(N2N-RTP)    protocol    designed    by    Capital
Technologies   and   Research   is   based   on   the
traditional  Peer-to-Peer                                  (P2P)  technology  that  is
getting  more  popular  day  by  day,  disrupting  the
technology for content distribution that we all know
about it.
We   give   our   users   the   possibility   of
communicating to each other in real-time without the
need for any special infrastructure, since all user’s
devices and nodes, together, collectively forms the
infrastructure.
Nodes of the network don’t need to download the
entire media buffer before relaying it to the next
node; this avoids long delays in conversation and
eliminates the need to store the entire conversations
into nodes.
In order to preserve the quality and avoid delays,
data is not split into equal chunks as it’s not suitable
for continuous media, which is of a variable bit rate
nature.

Capital Technologies & Research - Technical White Paper
When a conversation is started one node queries
the network mesh to check all possible ways to route
the connection, according to user preference about
security and quality of the service. Another mesh is
created  on  the  network,  that  is  being  used  as  a
backup  link  in  case  of  first  one’s  failure,  this
provides  flexibility  and  good  connection  between
users.
Let’s assume we have 2 users: Mike and Anna that
want to connect each other.
User registration
All users that want to use the communication system
are  required  to  register  into  the  network  with  an
Extended Public Key that is used later in encryption
layer. Extended Public Key is generated at the time
of the creation of the wallet, and it’s unique for each
account.

Session Initialization
Once Mike gets the Anna’s Extended Public Key
from the public blockchain, he then uses his own ID
(which was assigned on user’s first registration into
the network) among with his device id and public
key to compute a master shared secret. Once shared
secret is successfully computed by Mike, it is shared
through a secure tunnel, which is after deciphered
and validated by Anna. Upon validation of the master
shared secret by both parties, any of two users can
message each other.
Exchanging Messages
Once session is established, any of two users can
start sending each other messages, even if one party
is not online, but only if all participants have already
registered into the network by sharing their master
Extended public key.

Capital Technologies & Research - Technical White Paper
All messages exchanged through the network are
secured through a protocol that is similar to Extended
(X3DH) developed by Open Whisper Systems. Even
if someone tries to sniff the communication through
the system, it will look like all data are random,
because  each  message  has  a  different  signature
calculated with a different key every time (ephemeral
keys), so there’s no way to calculate a new key from
an old one, in case of compromising of a party’s
keys.
Encryption  of  communication  is                         256-bit  secure
through                                                   AES-256    symmetric    cipher    and
authenticated   by   HMAC-SHA256   hashes,   and
broadcasted to the Node-to-node Real-time Transport
Protocol (N2N-RTP) layer for distribution.

Voice calling
Once session is established, users have the ability
to  call  each  other,  by  using  the  agreement  to  a
common ephemeral session key that is valid only for
the duration of the specific call, and become useless
after the end of the call.
The voice call is made on the Node-to-node Real-
time  Transport  Protocol                                  (N2N-RTP)  layer  that
ensures decentralization, security and flexibility.
Key verification
Users can always verify and validate the keys of
any other party anytime. Validation of keys can be
done directly in the open ledger of the blockchain, or
through human readable 24 words mnemonic phrase,
that can be revealed directly from the application.
Payment system
Cost of the service will be determined by node
operators only, the team behind the project or any
individual user will have to respect node operator’s
decision about the cost involving his node in the
system.

Capital (CALL) is based on Proof of Work GPU
only  mining  algorithm.  It  is  used  only  for  call
initialization procedure that involves keys exchange
between other nodes and final users.
CapitalGAS (CALLG) usage is as we all know
about, like cost  (gas) per minute or cost  (gas) per
message. CapitalGAS (CALLG) is based on Proof of
Work  CPU  only  mining  algorithm,  offering  both
masternode  rewards  for  devoted  node  operators.
Aragon2d algorithm ensure zero abuse from botnets,
GPU  farms  &  ASIC’s.  Also  by  using  DELTA
difficulty  algorithm,  which  is  the  most  advanced
difficulty  retarget  algorithm  we  will  be  able  to
protect  against  evil  pools,  that  try  to  disrupt  the
network stability.
Conclusion
Communication  protocol  offered  by  Capital
Technologies  &  Research  is  one  most  secure
solution,  delivering  end-to-end  encryption  using
blockchain as ledger of public keys, offering a bullet
proof mechanism.
