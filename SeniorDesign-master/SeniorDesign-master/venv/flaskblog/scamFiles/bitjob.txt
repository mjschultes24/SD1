Abstract
bitJob will deploy blockchain technology in the global student community. Blockchain technology has the
potential to disrupt & overcome all boundaries, but we all understand that smart education of consumers
is necessary, in order for this to happen. Promoting the education needed to implement decentralization
and freedom of choice begins today, through the next generation of the labor market.

1. Introduction
1.1.                                                                                                         bitJob  is  the first freelancing platform that will be a hybrid of two
architectural paradigms.
●   Centralized client server architecture, which is used in the majority of online applications.
●   Decentralized version of client server architecture that uses blockchain technology.
The purpose of this is to speed up and improve the adoption of both the idea in the crowdfunding
phase and the platform by users. Although a decentralized paradigm is the ultimate goal, slow
adoption  of  blockchain  technologies  should  be temporarily substituted by solutions that are
familiar and acceptable to average internet user. Internet users today expect for online services to
be  fast,  with  intuitive  interfaces  that  are  accessible  with  mobile  devices.  This  dictates  our
approach that provides two technologies at the same time. With the adoption of the platform and
new  developments  in  blockchain  technologies,  users  are  seamlessly being switched to more
decentralized  solutions.  Once  users  are  familiar with the platform and the adoption of it is
satisfactory, users will be encouraged to interact through the blockchain section, which allows
them to pay for services with cryptocurrency and earn income through mining of cryptocurrency.
1.2.                                                                                                         Investment in the project in the initial phase will be enabled through
two vehicles.
●   Regular crowdfunding, accepting fiat currencies.
●   ICO, where tokens will be purchased with cryptocurrencies.
This will require that business will exists as two entities from the legal point of view. BitJob will
facilitate the providing of freelancing services through an online platform. Participants offering a
service (most often one which can be delivered online) will register with the system (as ‘service
providers’) and offer their availability to do the work in domain which is categorized by the
platform. Participants seeking certain services will register as ‘service consumers’ and will either
contact ‘service providers’ through the search function, or will enter a request for service which
can be then found by ‘service providers’. Bidding on services and setting request for services will
give participants the ability to interact and find mutual agreements regardless what demand and
supply is available.
Platform will provide mechanism to ensure that, upon agreement, sufficient money is kept in
escrow so the service provider is always paid unless there are issues with their providing of the
service, in which case the platform will offer conflict resolution methods.Users will be able to rate
each other, so frivolous or unreasonable ratings can’t continue for any significant length of time.
Users who collect negative ratings might be subjected to higher fees.
Platform  will  generate  revenue  through  fees  applied  to  both  service  provider  and  service
consumer.

1.3.  bitJob HYBRID MarketPlace Flowchart
The Following Flowchart represents our vision for bitJob HYBRID architectural Marketplace,
which will be handled both by Centralized servers (using fiat PP currency payment method) and
Decentralized infrastructure (Registration & Identity, Fees, Revenues distribution for Affiliates,
etc’).
The Chart shows both of bitJob future Tokens (STU & JOB) and their allocations methods for
the holders. More explanation about the differences between the tokens and their usages can be
found on Section 3 (STU - Equity) , and Section 5.3 (JOB - Bond).

1.4.  bitJob Mission
We fell in love with blockchain in 2011, upon first acquaintance with and investment in Bitcoin.
When Ethereum came into the world, we realized that this was what we were waiting for. The idea
of  bitJob  emerged  in  our  time  as  students, while we were enjoying the lawns of the faculty
meetings—and needing some quick money. After we graduated and dove into the labor market, we
were faced with a most painful problem, one that does not receive appropriate response: students
finish their degrees and begin their careers with zero experience, after spending their time in jobs
that do not contribute to their professional résumés.
As executives, we have encountered with another obvious need: employers find it difficult to hire
quality temporary workers that fit the budget —and most of them (80%) fail in recruiting students.
Our solution is to connect students with employers for small jobs online, so they can then to
continue to specialize in their relevant profession.
For  us,  as  entrepreneurs  who  want  to  influence  the  world,  helping  students  and promoting
blockchain technology—this is the realization of our dream.
1.5.    bitJob flow
It is very simple: a student looking to provide services online connects to the marketplace, chooses
from  the  list  of  professional  jobs  for  relevant  work,  provides  quality  delivery,  and  receives
immediate payment of his choice, in cryptocurrency or fiat money.
The student will build a reputation and be able to present his work in a Dynamic Portfolio Resume
(DPR) connected to his/her own  ‘name’ site! The DPR website will revolutionize the way HR
recruit students and graduates by relying on evidence of their demonstrated abilities, rather on
their LinkedIn profile or the ancient (and current) version of résumé, from previous decades.
1.6.   Students & Employers recruitment
We built a fantastic affiliate program that will strengthen the relationship between bitJob and the
students: students’ unions will receive a commission from each transaction their students engage
in. We have launched pilot agreements with the leading student associations in Israel, in addition
to a number of employers who were more than happy to participate. We are also negotiating with
several leading job search engines to ensure a continuous flow of quality jobs.
1.7.                                                                                                         Product Marketing
Student unions around the world constantly engage in programs for professional internships with
leading employers. In order to get as many students as possible to our marketplace, we created the
ultimate incentive with our affiliate program. It’s a win-win setup that will play a critical part in
bitJob’s success. Our focus on small online student jobs will attract the players in the field of
employee recruitment who are in pursuit of the next generation.

2.                                                                                                   Why blockchain?
In initial phase of this project, we were asked why we want to use blockchain technology for
something which doesn’t have obvious benefits of using it. Although the benefits are not instantly
visible, they are quite convincing when they are spelled out.
●                                                                                                    When money is moved between accounts, it can cost anywhere between 2% to 10% of the
transaction amount. The cost of moving money on the blockchain can be in vicinity of
0.01%.   If someone could capture the difference between the current cost of settling
transactions and the blockchain cost, the transfer of $1 million in revenue would produce
between  $20,000  and $100,000 in savings just by switching to blockchain. In certain
countries, those transaction fees might be even higher, and it can take several days to
process  them  due  to  restrictions  and  local  limitations—e.g.,  PayPal  is  not  offered
everywhere, and in some areas, transactions are held for many days before they appear in
the recipient account.
●                                                                                                    In  very  near  future,  blockchain  technologies  will  be  replacing  existing  client  server
architectures, and having one leg already there will make the platform ready to take
advantage of new ideas and trends, while other providers will be just starting to look into
solutions in that space.
●                                                                                                    ICO is possible when building a decentralized system. Additional funding can be obtained
through communities associated with cryptocurrencies.
●                                                                                                    The concept of mining is strictly related to the blockchain. Through the mining process,
with either proof of stake or proof of work, new coins can be created and distributed to
contributing community.
●                                                                                                    There is no need to create a legal entity if someone wants to reach markets in other
countries. E.g., China has the largest participation in Bitcoin/Ethereum mining and has
the largest crypto exchange market. India has relatively good awareness of Bitcoin due to
limited banking. The platform can function in those countries without a legal presence in
those countries because cryptocurrencies have no such regulations or requirements.
●                                                                                                    There is no need for bitJob to spend money on hardware, infrastructure, or tech staff.
Platforms like Ethereum offer such infrastructure, which has minimal cost only when
used. Any new technological advances within the Ethereum community will be available
to the platform as soon as they are created. It would be impossible for a business that
facilitates freelance jobs to simultaneously invent systems that can be competitive in the
global market. Due to the competitive nature of technology in global markets, it is very
likely  that  a  new  platform  similar  to  Ethereum  will  someday  appear—offering  new
abilities,  gaining  market  share,  and  offering  competitive  pricing—thus  creating  an
environment conducive to experimentation and to inexpensive operation.
●                                                                                                    Considering that this platform can operate in countries with much lower living standards
than Western countries, transactions can have very low values. Most payment processing
services charge minimum fees per transaction (e.g., $0.20). In places where the provided
service might be worth  $1, the charges would cost a disproportionate amount of the
service value. Blockchain transactions are fraction of this cost.

3.                                                                                                  bitJob Primary Equity Token (STU) & ICO emission
3.1                                                                                                 Why should bitJob have a unique Token?
Theoretically, BitJob can manage all the transactions on the platform in Ethers, bitcoin or other
cryptocurrencies. So why did we decide to create our own, brand new application-coin (appcoin)?
An important question indeed! today there are already a wide variety of cryptocurrencies traded
on exchanges and we expect a significant flow of ventures issuing app coins themselves, a real
haystack.
Our main reasons for issuing bitJob coin:
●   It is important to maintain unified standards and to inspire confidence in our users,
including affiliates like the respectable National Students’ Unions.
●   Creating an incentive for the new users to sign in, a win-win scenario, and we cannot do it
using Ether. Great giants like PayPal used the same strategy in their first years and we
look up for the best. With our business model backed up by market studies, we expect
massive  demand  by the students’ community and need to reserve our compensation
options for well-designed global expansion.
●   Subscriptions payments and bitJob Entity Management (BJE.M) facilitation. A successful
funding will speed up bitJob full product development.
●   Ventures need funding in order to get the chance to make an impact, maybe even to
change the world. Using the Ethereum blockchain, the unique ICO structure opens up
new opportunities for startups like bitJob, to create an exciting new revenue streams
woven in the hybrid marketplace, for the students’ unions and blockchain community
benefit.
We dearly value our contributors and understand that funding bitJob, means believing in bitJob
concept and bitJob product delivery by its team.
3.2. The bitJob primary equity token is a core element of bitJob network,
and it is designed with consideration of future network growth.
STU is initially created during the crowdfunding phase of the project and later through mining
activities, and it will be attributed various functions within project.
●   Payments from service consumers to service providers will be implemented through these
tokens in addition to through standard fiat payments via platforms like PayPal.
●   Developers, founders, and crypto-growth investors will be also receiving their rewards
and remuneration in these tokens.
●   Certain external services can be paid through these tokens.
●   Affiliates sending referrals will be offered commission in these tokens.
●   Users:  Ownership  and  subsequent  locking  of certain number  (e.g.  5000  coins when
purchased  during  ICO)  of  tokens  exempts  users  from  all  future  bitJob  economy

fees.   Tokens are used as proof of stake, to determine how much voting power each user
has regarding the future of the platform. Members can be offered interests like rewards in
form of newly minted tokens.
●                                                                                                  Evangelist: Receive rewards for introducing bitJob to new educational organizations.
Fixed bonus after certain number of members register from the educational organization
and actively use the system.
●                                                                                                  Developers:  Ownership  and  subsequent  locking  of  tokens  (e.g.,  50,000  coins  when
purchased during ICO) exempts developers from any future bitJob economy fees. Tokens
are used as proof of stake, to determine how much voting power each developer has
regarding the future of the platform. Members can be offered interest-like rewards in
form of newly minted tokens.
●                                                                                                  Evangelists  and  Developers:  Committing  tokens  for  a  locked  period  opens  the
opportunity to receive benefits from fees generated by the platform. Locking tokens for
fixed period of time helps protect the stability and reputation of the platform, and it
represents  a  person’s  effort  to  spread  the  awareness  of the platform.  (There is also
duration-weighted bonus.)
●                                                                                                  Example:
Here is an example of how it works: Assume an Evangelist owns E% of the total supply.
The average fee for each bitJob transaction is R and the number of bitJob transactions
per day is V. The evangelist total reward per period will have an expected value of:
●   Reward = E* R * V
●   Let E = 1%, R=$10, V=1,000
●   Reward = 1 * 10 * 1000 = $100/day = $36,600/year
●   The  supply  of  STU  will  be  not limited to the pool of tokens created during
crowdfunding period. Mining activities will be responsible for creation of new
units. (See “Mining” section of this document.)
3.3.                                                                                               Creation of the STU and initial account functionalities
The bitJob (STU) Token is a token on the Ethereum platform. Its design follows widely adopted
token implementation standards. This makes it easy to manage using existing solutions, including
Ethereum Wallet.
●   Maximum number of tokens created during ICO : 100,000,000 (100%)
●   Sending 1 Ether to the bitJob account will create 1000 STU.
●   Tokens will be transferable once the crowdfunding is successfully completed.
●   The amount of STU coins per 1 Ether might vary due to movement in Ether price. The
final values will be determined at the beginning of Emission day.

●                                                                                               When a user downloads the bitJob application, first they will be prompted to confirm
their   details   and   ensure   that   they   provided   a   valid/current  student  number
associated/registered with the platform Educational Organization, College or University.
A unique deposit address will be generated for them within the Ethereum network. This
address will be used to transfer funds to and from the platform’s token. A new member
who would like to use services of other students will need to acquire/earn some tokens.
●                                                                                               This can be accomplished through direct depositing of Ether into this new generated
address or through mining activities as mentioned below. Student will not be able to hire
any of the available service providers and/or communicate with other members until they
have a sufficient amount of  tokens in their account to be able to purchase a minimum
quantity of service set by service provider. Service provider will be able to review feedback
provided by other service providers in regards to the member seeking service, and vice
versa.
●                                                                                               Once the agreement between service provider and service seeker has been reached, a
minimum value of tokens needed to pay for the service will be locked (kept in escrow).
The minimum amount will be set by service provider.
●                                                                                               Members  can  engage  service  providers  through  a  direct  hiring  or  bidding  process.

price for service seekers and will automatically lock the money of service seekers when
auction is finished.

value of services rendered, and the platform will run on the public Ethereum network.
Fees for token transaction will be minimal, as no currency exchange will take place and
no fiat money or banking will be involved. In regards to PayPal or other fiat solutions,
regular fees rendered by those networks will be in force. Users can choose to keep their
earnings within the platform and exchange their earnings other services provided by
other members.
●                                                                                                     System will offer interest-like rewards to members who choose to keep their earnings in
the platform. A number of tokens will be mined in exchange for the long-term locking of
their earnings within the system.   In short, a regular user will have opportunity to invest
in the platform.
●                                                                                                     User would still be able to spend/transfer their locked tokens with other members in the
platform. In the case of the spending of locked tokens, a portion of the future reward
would be subtracted.
●                                                                                                     As additional features, members would have ability to loan their tokens to other members
for interest, effectively enabling this platform to be a p2p lending facility. This would
increase the liquidity of the platform, for tokens would stay in the system, and it would
also increase the attractiveness of the platform for members who had higher ability of
earning new tokens as they would have incentive to keep their earned tokens in the
system for longer periods.   The loyalty and the growth of the platform would also benefit
from this.
●                                                                                                     Stakeholders will be also rewarded by allowing them to use their stake in the organization
as their voting power in liquid democracy module which will be used to vote on issues
pertaining to the future of the platform.
5. Contribution to the Platform
This section outlines the ideas behind bitJob and its rewards for people who provide meaningful
and measurable contributions to the community.
5.1.   Capital Contributions
There are two ways bitJob can offer participation to early investors.
●   Buying into the ownership of the community.
●   Buying debt of the community.
In  first  case,  investor benefits when community grows, and investor loses when community
shrinks.
In the second case, investor will have a guaranteed return based on agreed interest rate, but they
will have no opportunity to benefit from community growth and will not lose when community
falls apart or is not growing.   Both ideas are beneficial for the organization as long as they are
11




proportionately  allocated.   It  would  seem  that  having                                           40-60  (debt-investment)  allocation
relation would be ideal.
The first group will bring a needed influx of money, which can be locked for longer term and
rewards only paid if such investments are actually occurring. This group will be deeply interested
in the startup’s growth and its success, due to the motivational element that is built into the
arrangement.
The second group, on the other hand, will help with accumulation of initial resources needed to
start the development and creation of the infrastructure of the startup. The amount of return is
agreed at the initial step, so only that much will be paid back to the investor. If the company is
growing and creating profits, there should be enough left after the return of the investment to
keep momentum going and increase the startup’s activity.
5.2.                                                                                                  Distributing Currency
There are two ways people can get involved with a cryptocurrency community: they can buy in, or
they can work in. In both cases, users are adding value to the currency; however, the vast majority
of people have more free time than they do spare cash.
5.3.                                                                                                  Buying Debt of the Community - Bond Token (JOB)
One of the ideas to give additional incentive to early investors is a way to peg the token value to
one of the stable cryptocurrencies. This way, investors can have the peace of mind when entering
the organization in its early stages, when it is not certain if investment will be profitable or
without risks.
To accomplish this model, bitJob would first implement two cryptotokens. The first one is called
STU (It’s described in section 3) and another called JOB, where JOB is pegged to Bitcoin.
To accomplish effective binding of two currencies, JOB and Bitcoin, the startup would implement
an interest rate that would be automatically changed when the token value inside the organization
was trading out of parity with Bitcoin. The interest rate would be either positive or negative.
Increasing the interest rate would create conditions to buy and keep JOB, and decreasing the
interest rate would cause that holders of such tokens were motivated to sell them. The selling and
buying of JOB would not affect the bottom line of the startup, because the JOB circulation would
be static and the cryptocurrency purchased would initially be in the startup’s hands. In addition,
the goal of moving the interest rate down or up is to keep the value of the token aligned with
Bitcoin price.
On the other hand, the value of JOB could fluctuate and is a determining factor of the startup’s
growth.
●   See this example:
John wants to invest in the bitJob but is not entirely convinced that organization will take
off.   To give John some assurance, bitjob would guarantee that money invested in the
startup would be kept pegged to Bitcoin. In addition to this, investor would be offered an
incentive, e.g., 5% yearly compounded earnings through the internal second coin SmBit.
So investor is guaranteed to get his initial investment equivalent in Bitcoins back, and
additionally a value equivalent to 5% of the initial investment, paid out in STU.
12




STU will be mined and minted according to methods that will be decided later. In any
case, the promised 5% would be created through new tokens mined/minted during the
period of investment.
5.4. Earning Tokens through Affiliate Activity (Mining)
Any activity within the startup that would create new value in the market could be rewarded with
mining rewards. (See “Mining” later in this document.)
One of the ideas involving mining activity is to reward actions of larger contributors to the growth
of the network. It is possible that student unions at each university or educational organization
would be interested in receiving mining rewards for promoting bitJob within their community.
The student union could receive payments in the form of STUf for each new member who joins
the platform and engages in some activity considered creative effort for the platform. As the
system grows and the student community becomes aware of this platform, role of the student
union would be less influential, so it is reasonable to assume that rewards to the student union
would be smaller, but growth of the organization would be impacted by referring of new members
by other students, and those students would need to be rewarded increasingly now for their
efforts.
So student unions could be initially offered a larger incentive to promote the platform but with
reduced levels of earnings as time progresses—e.g., during the first year, mining bounty could be
5% of the token activity, then the next year could be 4%, then 3%, until the point that the student
unions would receive mining rewards equal to those received by individual miners.
5.5.                                                                                                   Initial Directions of Expansion and Justification
For the system to be successful and get momentum going, efforts need to be started where the
chances of success are the greatest.
Most mining activity happens in China, mostly due to the price of electricity, which many miners
obtain free of charge from Chinese government.  (This is because there is lesser demand for
energy by the large commercial entities at night, but the energy supply can’t be easily regulated to
protect circuits from overloading. It is easier to offer free energy to other organizations than to
maintain and/or replace overloaded equipment.)   Also, the largest crypto trading platforms are
found in China. The number of available educational centers is largest in India, followed by China
and then Western countries.
The above details could indicate that initial market penetration should target those regions.
The bitJob platform will initially contact student unions of universities in North America for
affiliate engagement. The main reasons for this decision are the following facts:
●   Students in North America are already well connected through social media channels.
●   They have easy access to Internet .
●   The  majority  of  development  in  the  crypto-world  sphere  already  happens  in  North
America, thus awareness of crypto-concepts should be the largest in intellectual circles
there.
13




●   Most related publications are already in English language, which makes accessibility to
this knowledge more likely to be available to someone living in North America than it is
elsewhere.
●   Entry into the crypto markets is also easier for residents of North America than residents
of India and China, where there are large university centers but average income of those
residents is ten or multiples of tens less than in North America.
●   In order to enter the cryptocurrency market, a person needs to have access to banking.
Today, these services are available at a more favorable level to residents of the Western
world than they are in Eastern countries like China or India.
●   Investment concepts and crowdfunding are also very well understood in North America,
and tactics to gain significant investors in the initial stages will be much more effective
there
●   Cultural  understanding  and  language  from the perspective of someone living in and
understanding  Western  culture will also be of importance to get this platform going
initially.
5.6.                                                                                                   Future Steps of Expansion
Once the bitJob system is up and running and it has received a certain level of adoption in North
America, efforts should be made to start application of the same affiliate concepts to university
communities in India and China. This could be done one year from the initial start.    A new
crowdfunding round could be started and new tokens released for each country.   New tokens
could increase involvement of investors in those countries by giving them an early advantage of
investing in a new entity when the price of tokens could still be low. Also, success of the platform
in North America could give an indication of potential profits or earnings for the investors for the
Indian and Chinese markets.    Having country-specific tokens would allow an easy correlation
between the country’s pay levels and job values.    Specific tokens for each country would also
make country-specific smart contracts and currencies independent of each other and would allow
on implementation of smart contracts more specific for customary and cultural relations there.
The token for India could trade differently than token for China. This would also allow interesting
developments in exchanges of those tokens.

Generally users, upon establishing connection through the bitJob platform, will be able to connect
in  physical  world  or  through  some  communication  application  like  Skype,  Hangouts,  or
Whatsapp. To ensure that services are provided in accordance with bitJob standards and users
receiving those services are satisfied and safe, the system will rely on a reputation mechanism.
Each service provider and service seeker will have the opportunity to    provide feedback about
the other party. Results of this feedback will be displayed on the member profile of each service
provider and service seeker, and it will be publicly visible to members.
This setup also provides an opportunity to add insurance options to the platform, where members
can give an option to purchase insurance that would guarantee them the recovery of tokens on
spent services which prove to be poorly rendered or not provided according to an agreement.

JOB will not be responsible for engaging in receiving or disbursement of fiat currency. Instead,
local  partners  will  be  recommended  where  users  can acquire cryptocurrencies like Ether or
Bitcoin, and tokens can be exchanged once this cryptocurrency has been sent to a special address
on an Ethereum blockchain.
The address will be the address of a smart contract that will understand how to allocate certain
amount of tokens in exchange for cryptocurrency sent to it. (See below in “Risks and Challenges”
for an explanation of why we need to stay away from fiat money.)
8.                                                                                                     User Interface
The bitJob product will have two interface points: the web portal and the iOS/Android-native
application.   The website will have similar features to the mobile apps and will be accessible over
any web browser. Upon accessing the website or mobile app, the user will be presented with the
following options:
●   Join bitJob as service provider
●   Join bitJob as service seeker
●   Manage my account.
Within  the  account,  the  user will be able to extend their options—able to become a service
provider if they joined originally    as a service seeker, or vice versa.
●   Create service offer (if service provider)
●   Create service request (if service seeker)
●   Search for Service Requests. (if service provider)
●   Search for Service Providers (if service seeker, based on categories and keywords)
●   Bid on service request (if service provider)
●   Bid on Service (if service seeker)
●   Provide feedback and rate service seeker (if service provider)
●   Provide feedback and rate service provider (if service seeker)
●   Create conversation with other party
●   View wallet and mining rewards

9.    Credit Reputation
Individual                                                                                             “Credit  Scoring”  mechanism  will  be  created  to  incorporate  elements  of  service
providers, service seekers, and service applicability to the platform (e.g., how service relates to
addressing student problems and needs).
10.  Fee Structure
bitJob  fees  will  be inversely proportional to the amount of users on the platform. Fees can
increase to dedicate funds and reward members contributing to the growth of the platform. A
tiered bonus system will be designed and employed to reward early adopters and evangelists.
11.                                                                                                    Mining
Participants of the platform will be able to mine tokens through activities benefiting the platform.

12. Technical Description
bitJob is characterized by two key operational pillars: autonomy and decentralization.
Autonomy: The Ethereum platform allows for the creation of smart contracts that run business
logic autonomously, and we will utilize these features for fast, secure, and reliable processing of
the bitJob process that has been detailed.   This will reduce operational costs compared to those
currently found on existing online freelancing platforms.
Unlike existing centralized platforms and services, bitJob transactions will be publicly verifiable,
viewable, self-operated, and not the subject to the risk of institutional processing. Our system is a
finite state machine, and manual transactions are essentially unneeded.
12.1. Decentralization
Traditional online businesses with centralized structures are subject to hacking, strict financial
regulations,  and  high  overhead  costs.  The  decentralization  of  bitJob—particularly  for  its
transaction  processing,  auctions, contribution tracking, and distribution of funds—allows the
elimination of payment processors, reduces the operational burden of regulation compliance, and
reduces costs associated with inefficient accounting and duplication of functionality. In addition,
it protects against organizational corruption such as fraud and embezzlement.
12.2. Handling of Bad Actors
Building on top of the Ethereum platform, bitJob is inherently decentralized. Smart contracts
guarantee that no external parties can influence the transparent process for an extended period of
time, for all transactions are verifiable. Any fault in the system will quickly become evident, and
measures can be taken to eliminate bad actors from such influence, such as by building measures
into the system that can disable accounts that abuse bitJob and freeze all associated funds.
The system will be equipped with authentication and authorization logic as well as permission
management.
12.3. Security
Security is given the highest priority. Smart contracts are responsible for handling the transfer of
money, and the reputation system will be subjected to a comprehensive security audit prior to
launching the platform on the testnet. We will hire experienced a security expert to validate our
system’s fraud-prevention measures and to evaluate system defenses from malicious attackers. In
addition,  we  are  planning  to  build  protection  mechanisms  in  the  system  to  monitor  all
transactions and freeze suspicious activity and user accounts, to determine the weight of the
exploit or attack or suspicious activity.
12.4. Sybil Attack Prevention
Because bitJob is community-based application and trust in it depends on a user reputation
system, it is important that users who register are sufficiently verified before they are able to
conduct  activity within the network. So-called Sybil attacks, characterized by the creation of
multiple anonymous accounts, should be largely mitigated by verification of student credentials.
In addition, the system should be able to verify accounts by making checks against popular social
networking  sites  or  systems  known  for  providing  user  verification  or  cell  phone  numbers,

requiring two-way verification. In addition, all accounts should be funded with Ether before any
activity is allowed on the network.

14. Risks, Challenges and Opportunities
14.1. Fiat-to-Crypto Fees
In order to use our platform, users must have cryptocurrencies prior to its use. Fees associated
with buying and selling cryptocurrencies, as well as the limited options to exchange fiat money
into cryptocurrency and back, can limit success of our business model. Only users who have an
understanding of crypto world can be early adopters of our system.
The cost savings of using our network might be in question if you take into account the exchange
fees one has to incur to enter and exit our platform.
14.2. Low Levels of Cryptocurrency Ownership
Due to the fact that few people today own cryptocurrencies on a regular basis, initial growth of the
network might be slow. Despite this, those who already have access to cryptocurrencies will create
a loyal group of customers and will help with establishing a small but active community.
14.3. Regulatory Compliance
In  order  to  avoid  regulatory  risk,  our  platform  initially  will  not  offer  fiat-to-crypto  and
crypto-to-fiat conversion. This would require establishing itself as a legal currency exchange,
which might be very costly, time consuming, and subject to various regulatory changes. At the
same time, this will limit members’ entry into the system, requiring them to go through several
hoops to be able to enter our system.
14.4. Malicious Users Might Undermine the System
There would be no legal recourse if malicious users had an intention to undermine the system by
flooding it with illegitimate service offers or service use methods. The system needs to have such
checkpoints in place that will deactivate malicious members at the earliest possibility and prevent
significant damages.

14.5. Future Opportunities
Awareness of cryptocurrencies is growing in the world in general, and our target audience is
young people who are the earliest adopters of technologies and particularly Internet. We can
therefore be optimistic and trust that, in time, we will have the best access to a prime group that is
both advanced and sophisticated, fluent with the usage of cryptocurrencies in the world. Also our
target audience is people who are already organized in communities, and due to the lack of funds,
we are looking for ways of saving money. The student world and its word of mouth will become
the main forces driving our network, as low-cost marketing. These students will gain a familiarity
with our system that means they could continue to be the main users of bitJob even after our
platform evolves to suit more types of work, not just what suits students.
