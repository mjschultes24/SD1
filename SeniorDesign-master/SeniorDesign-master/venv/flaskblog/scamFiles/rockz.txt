ROCKZ WHITE PAPER
1  FOREWORD
Cryptocurrencies have exploded to become the crossover economic story of our time.
To understand how this has happened, it’s necessary to understand both Global Finance
and Blockchain Technology.
In an evolutionary sense, these new currencies have been created from the need of global
finance to liberate capital from the grip of regulation and the increasing control of a small
class of private investors.
The seeds of today’s cryptocurrencies were sown during the last decade when many
companies chose to leave public exchanges and go private. The number of Initial Public
Offerings (IPOs) decreased dramatically, due mainly to the enormous burden of government
regulation placed on public companies and the associated costs of compliance1 .
As a result, Private Equity and Venture Capital investments have grown disproportionately,
but they are still inherently reserved for the class of elite investors: Ultra High Net Worth
Individuals, Family Offices, or professional investors. The richest receive preferential
access to the most interesting investments, while leaving smaller investors to pick over the
investment opportunities that are left: based on latest reports from OXFAM, the richest 1%
bagged 82% of the wealth created last year2.
The rise of cryptocurrencies is the counterswing to this phenomenon and is a direct response
to the mistrust of the “Old Economy”. In 2017 we reached the tipping point.

FOREWORD
2017 was the year that the cryptosphere went stratospheric. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)
erupted everywhere - propelled by a turbulent sea of both fevered hype and genuine
innovation. Today, cryptocurrencies and ICOs have become a new asset class, praised
by active investors around the globe.
Despite  some  critics  within  the  established  economy,  cryptocurrencies  have  proven
themselves to be a new way to exchange, transact and invest. ICOs have created a new way
to fund projects, and are supporting innovative and disruptive ideas all around the world.
In 2017 alone, around 900 ICOs raised more than $6 billion3.
ICOs are here to stay. The market will continue to evolve and, as it integrates regulation and
accommodates new developments, will consolidate itself into a legitimate new asset class.
But in order to attract more institutional investors and maintain growth, several important
gaps and shortcomings need to be addressed.
The major challenge encountered in this new cryptosphere is the absence of a trustworthy
anchor to the traditional economy; a bridge between the two worlds. At a time when some
ICOs and coins are getting some justifiably negative press, it is time to offer a stable and
legally enforceable cryptocurrency bringing together the best of two worlds. This is ROCKZ.

ROCKZ WHITE PAPER

2.1                                                                                                                    PROBLEM STATEMENT
Traders and investors engaging in the cryptosphere today must learn to live with certain
risks. There is currently no reference or reserve currency that satisfactorily mitigates these
risks. This means that, for the time being, the only safe way for crypto investors to secure
their profits is to return to fiat currency and thereby exit the cryptosphere.
This identifies an inherent tension that, if left unsolved, will inhibit the future growth of the
cryptosphere as an asset class.
Let’s examine the nature of the risks at play.
Investors can leave fiat currency in certain exchanges, but will bear a counterparty risk since
most of the exchanges are unregulated. Unregulated exchanges are effectively the owners
of the assets deposited by their clients, be they fiat or coins. In case of bankruptcy, fraud or,
(self-declared) hacking, those assets are completely at the risk of being lost. There are a few
regulated exchanges that do protect deposits, but only to a certain limit, based on country
protection schemes. At best, there are only limited protections for anyone depositing assets
into exchanges.
On top of that, there is a huge security risk, with many exchanges having been hacked during
the last few years. Hundreds of millions of dollars were stolen in 2017, and in cases so far
in 2018, we have seen the total number of stolen assets reach alarming levels4 . When coins
and tokens are held at centralized exchanges, investors’ assets can disappear within seconds,
and typically are never recovered. It has happened and will happen again.
Of course investors can, with some know-how and at additional cost, transfer their crypto
investments to cold wallets in order to mitigate some security risks. Nevertheless, cold
wallets do not erase the market risk of holding main coins used as a pivot or reserve, such
as Bitcoin or Ethereum. These main coins still bear extreme volatility and therefore do not
eradicate all risks for investors6.
4 2018 started the year with the biggest hacking of around 700m USD equivalent on a Japanese exchange. http://money.
cnn.com/2018/01/29/technology/coincheck-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack-japan/index.html. Less massive, but still
painful attacks happened with Bithumb, Bitfinex, Poloniex

VISION AND OVERVIEW
Finally,  crypto  investors  who  are  willing  to  take  profits  out  of  the  system,  be  it
on a temporary basis before entering a new position, or on a permanent basis, incur high
fees and time delays6. While a fiat payment takes only a few seconds to be made in most
countries, transferring cash out of the cryptosphere can take days or weeks before being
completed. During this time, crypto investors bear market, counterparty, and security risks.
There are some options to partially minimize these industry risks, especially market risk,
such as by the use of stablecoins, which, being backed by «classic» assets (like cash or gold),
are relatively stable.   However these solutions may also have their own shortcomings.
For example, the most popular stablecoin, Tether, which now has more than $2.9 billion
in daily trading volume, is still not the best choice in terms of transparency. It was suspected
to have a shortfall problem in a reserves audit, and moreover, of taking part in possible
cryptocurrency market manipulations7.
Compared to the ease of entering the cryptosphere as an investor, making a pause between
investments or going out of the cryptosphere can be costly, risky and complicated.
2.2                                                                                                                 THE SOLUTION
ROCKZ addresses a major shortcoming of the cryptosphere: the lack of a trustworthy
anchor in the traditional economy - a way to book profits while still staying in crypto; a way
to address counterparty, security, and market risks.
Institutional investors, such as funds, insurance companies or pension funds, are willing
to  enter  this  new  asset  class,  which  is  decorrelated  from  traditional  investments.
But to penetrate this new asset class they need a point of reference, a safe harbour,
a reserve coin. This is ROCKZ.
The ROCKZ issuing company enables investors and traders to exchange their main crypto
currencies against a ROCKZ. For each ROCKZ issued, 1 Swiss Franc (CHF) is held by the
ROCKZ issuing company for the account of the coin holders. By definition, ROCKZ is stable.
The ROCKZ issuing company holds up to 90% of its reserves in Swiss Francs (the Reserves) in
physical paper form (i.e., banknotes) which are deposited in high-security Swiss Alp Bunkers
and Vaults. The remaining 10% is held with various Swiss Banks to ensure short-term
availability of the Swiss Francs. ROCKZ is solid and agile.

ROCKZ WHITE PAPER
The  Reserves  are  held  by  the  ROCKZ  issuing  company  under  a  fiduciary  mandate
and are segregated from the company’s operating accounts. Even in the case of bankruptcy
of the ROCKZ issuing company, ROCKZ coin holders still have full access to their Swiss Franc
fiat reserves. ROCKZ holders are protected.
The ROCKZ issuing company is building a rigorous and robust legal framework which ensures
that ROCKZ is effectively backed by the reserves of Swiss Francs and that claims are legally
enforceable. ROCKZ is reliable.
ROCKZ is pioneering and fostering a new level of adoption for crypto enthusiasts and investors.
ROCKZ erases the main crypto market risk by backing the coin to one of the most stable
currencies, thereby reducing counterparty risk to a minimum.
No other coin offers this level of protection.
WHY SWISS FRANCS?
ROCKZ focuses on the CHF not only because of the key role Switzerland is playing
in the development of crypto currencies, but foremost because the CHF offers real protection
against inflation and devaluation. Over the last 50 years, the United States Dollar (USD)
has lost 78% of its value to the CHF. Even when the CHF pays negative interest rates,
the currency has been appreciating. In other words, CHF has been, until now, the Bitcoin
of the traditional markets: the currency of a small country with a limited supply.
Switzerland is a politically neutral country with a long-held respect for the private sector;
a very important value to all parties involved in the project. Switzerland, with more than $6.5
trillion in assets under management and 25% of the market share of worldwide offshore
assets is one of the key financial centres worldwide8. In comparison, with only 8 million
inhabitants, the Swiss Financial Centre is about the same size as the British Financial Centre
(65 million inhabitants), or roughly half that of Japan (127 million inhabitants)9.

VISION AND OVERVIEW
USD/CHF development since 1971
Since 1971, the USD has lost 78% of its value against the CHF.
CHFUSD (inverted) Compared to the XBTUSD10
While we can’t compare the increase in value of the CHF over almost 50 years, and the increase in value
of Bitcoin over one year, it is interesting to see that the two currencies have been showing a very similar
growth against the USD.

3.1                                                                                              MARKET REVIEW
Cryptocurrencies and tokens have boomed in recent years. As of January 2018, total
market capitalization reached an all time-high of $800 billion, with the dominance of Bitcoin
decreasing progressively with the development of alternative coins and tokens. Fortunes
have been made by early investors and traditional active investors are starting to discover
this new asset class. But those fortunes may diminish as fast as they are earned. According
to the latest statistics available to date, cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased
almost fourfold to $200 billion11.
Over                                                                                             1,500  coins  and  tokens  now  exist,  and  the  market  is  set  to  grow  further,
with the development of new projects supported by another wave of ICOs, despite the recent
market downturn trend. Increasingly, coins are now evolving towards an asset-backed
approach,  and  many  projects  are  trying  to  provide  the  market  with  stable  coins,
backed - or not - with underlying assets.
Tether  has  the  closest  existing  answer  to  solving  the  problem  we  have  identified
with the market. Rapid growth and over $2.9 billion in daily trading volume shows how much
demand there is for a secure coin in the cryptocurrency space12.

However, Tether and other asset-backed coins have inherent flaws that ROCKZ does not.
ROCKZ coins are fully backed by CHF Reserves, the strongest currency in the world,
with 90% in physical form deposited in vaults and banks. By choosing a physical form at a level
of 90%, coin holders don’t need to fear about the safety of the banks. ROCKZ is completely
transparent as regards to Reserves held for coin holders and they are audited on a monthly
basis.
ROCKZ coin holders have a legal right to CHF fiat currency in an equivalent amount of their
investments. Even if the ROCKZ  issuing company goes bankrupt, coin holders will get their
legal claims against the ROCKZ  issuing company transferred by vault operators and banks.
ROCKZ coin holders can transfer equivalent CHF fiat amounts to their designated bank
or credit card account, or get notes physically delivered in Switzerland.

As more cryptocurrency projects come on the board every month, the critical nature of their
connection with the real world becomes ever more obvious. We have mentioned the very real
risks of high volatility in base value, the partial or absolute lack of transparency, the lack
of security, and the volatile costs of funds transfer.
ROCKZ is created to solve these problems and to deliver blockchain advantages in several
industries, such as:
E-COMMERCE
Nowadays, e-commerce organizations avoid using cryptocurrencies because of their high
volatility: they are not sure if their funds will become valueless during the next market
downturn. Despite this high volatility of cryptocurrencies, there are several alternative
processing solutions, such as Bitpay, Coinpayment, and of course, CoinBase. The e-commerce
market represents a prime opportunity for crypto-services: its size is forecast to exceed
$2.9 trillion worldwide in 201813.
The main players include Alipay, Tenpay, PayPal, Webmoney, Visa, Mastercard and American
Express. But e-commerce merchants still use more traditional services, such as Paypal,
WebMoney and bankcard processing, in spite of the several advantages that blockchain
technology   itself   brings:   transparent   transaction   records   and   lower   fees
(which are dependent on network type). Of course, the ROCKZ platform is not intended
to replace Visa or Mastercard any time soon, but its pricing policy allows it to favorably
compete with PayPal and similar services.
Here we bring together Paypal, Webmoney and ROCKZ possible processing fees:

Processing Fees                                                                                  the currency per transaction
                                                                                                                                 per transaction             + conversion fee
                                                                                                 (for example, CHF 0.55 for                                  if conversion is required
standard transactions)
It is obvious that ROCKZ has a sizeable competitive advantage. The main goal of the platform
is to provide the most advantageous conversion fees while maintaining the same liquidity
as their main competitors.

THE MARKET AND THE COMPETITION
INVESTMENT
Here we consider the ways where ROCKZ can be useful. The first is by trading in a protected
asset base. Nowadays, there are two basic trading strategies: trade against a fiat currency,
or  trade  against  bitcoin.  The  first  reflects  traders’  beliefs  that  cryptocurrencies
are secondary to traditional markets and that profits have to be converted into a fiat currency
to achieve financial goals. In this case, traders need assets that offer a stable comparison
against the USD or other national currencies in order to fix profits while simultaneously
holding market value.
The core value of the second strategy is due to the strong confidence in bitcoin’s value
continuing to grow in future. This strategy allowed higher profit gains in the past,
but as we can see, this confidence may prove costly if market trends change direction.
Both cases reveal a need for a strong financial shield to fix profits - and ROCKZ fills
that requirement perfectly.
Yet another way where ROCKZ is useful is through the use of ICOs. This part of the industry
continues to grow, and despite the current shortcomings of many projects, ICOs as a method
of funds collection can already be considered as a viable alternative to traditional venture
financing. The dramatic decrease in market capitalization that has recently occurred
has forced many projects to reconsider their financial roadmaps due to changes in the value
of collected funds. Projects that completed ICOs in conditions of overheated markets
are in a difficult situation now, because their financial resources have fallen dramatically,
in some cases by threefold or fourfold. Now ROCKZ introduce a stable and reliable instrument
for ICO investments. Its stablecoin nature makes collected funds stable.
Stablecoin trading volumes confirm the global need for market protected assets. Tether
daily trading volumes can exceed $2.9 billion, according to coinmarketcap.com. For other
known stablecoins, TrueUSD, BitCNY and BitUSD, these values are USD 15 million, USD 15.7
million and USD 1.6 million respectively. These volumes also reflect one important potential
problem for most investors: in the case of Tether, they are vested in less reliable assets.
MONEY TRANSFERS
According to Statista, the P2P money transfer market size will reach  $65.7 billion
at the end of 2018 (excluding corporate transfers)14. The main players here are Western
Union, UAE, Exchange, MoneyGram and Ria. Western Union dominate the market, processing
nearly  30% of all transfers. Their transfer fees vary from  0.5-1% of the sum being
transferred, depending upon the transfer time. Although current blockchain solutions
(such as Ripple) allow clients to implement transfers faster and cheaper, there are countries
where the exchange of cryptocurrencies is not allowed. The ROCKZ solution is able to avoid
these limitations, because it includes “native” options to convert tokens into a fiat currency
and to deliver transfers directly into a client’s bank account.

ROCKZ WHITE PAPER
3.4                                                                                                ROCKZ POTENTIAL USERS
The ROCKZ platform is designed for several types of users:
EARLY CRYPTO ADOPTERS
Private crypto investors who have successfully completed investments in the cryptosphere
and want to protect their wealth by sheltering it from market, security and counterparty
risks. ROCKZ offers a ‘safe harbour’ for their wealth when the seas gets rough.
INSTITUTIONAL CRYPTO INVESTORS AND FUND MANAGERS
Institutional  investors  are  increasing  their  participation  in  this  new  asset  class.
For both short and long term trading, they require a mechanism to pause between periods
of investment activity.
CORPORATES, SERVICE PROVIDERS AND PRIVATE INVESTORS
ROCKZ is designed for corporations investing directly for their own account, and service
providers acting on behalf of their clients, as well as private individuals who wish to receive
payments in cryptocurrencies, but are unwilling to take the market risk related to main
coins. All are looking for ease and convenient availability in the collection of their payments,
while still maintaining the security and stable values of their assets. Again, ROCKZ suits all
of their needs perfectly.
CRYPTO-TRADERS
Crypto traders systematically make several deals a day, or week , depending on their trading
style. As was mentioned above, these users need an instrument that allows them to fix
positions fast and switch to new target searches. Currently traders use Tether, being under
counterparty risks, or Bitcoin, being under market risks. ROCKZ is constructed to avoid both
of these risks. Long term investors share the same problems - and the same solution.
16




THE MARKET AND THE COMPETITION
USERS OF P2P MONEY TRANSFERS
These users are searching for a reliable and cheap means for the transfer of funds to other
regions or countries, which can be easily converted to readily available funds. ROCKZ solves
this problem, and even allow users to avoid the conversion step, since the stablecoin nature
of ROCKZ allows merchants to accept these tokens as a means of payment.
MERCHANTS
They are looking for a fast, easy and cheap instrument of payment collection. Moreover,
this instrument must keep the value of funds stable over time.   As was mentioned above,
ROCKZ suits this perfectly.
COMMON USERS
They are not world-wise users of cryptocurrencies and only want to safely store their
earnings. In countries where currencies can devalue quickly or are even subject to country
default and commercial bank failure, ROCKZ offers a solution to keep their capital safe.
3.5                                                                                                 ROCKZ USE CASES
ROCKZ AS A RESERVE CURRENCY
The initial and primary purpose of ROCKZ is to be used by any crypto investors willing
to place and hold a cryptocurrency: offering stable and accessible value backed by fiat currency
and eliminating any unnecessary counterparty, market or security risks. Typical users
are early-stage investors in the cryptosphere who have profited from the market growth
and are now looking to preserve part of their wealth.
ROCKZ AS A PIVOT CURRENCY
Professional investors, such as crypto funds, who are looking for a pivot currency
they can use to diversify their risk or to temporarily exit the crypto market during times
of high volatility can feel safe in ROCKZ. Due to its direct link to CHF, ROCKZ doesn’t fluctuate
and thus offers a safe haven to such investors.
17




ROCKZ WHITE PAPER
ROCKZ AS A TRADITIONAL STORE OF CURRENCY VALUE
By not incurring value changes, ROCKZ is stable and offers anyone willing to receive or pay
for services or goods the possibility to pay with a cryptocurrency with an defined base value.
It is an easy, safe and fast way to receive or pay for services or goods.
ROCKZ AS AN EXIT FROM  THE CRYPTOSPHERE TO THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
Because the ROCKZ platform doesn’t issue coins without being completely backed, coin
holders can be certain that an equivalent fiat currency amount is always ready to be
transferred or distributed to ROCKZ holders. It therefore allows coin holders to exit
the cryptosphere at any point in time and without experiencing any liquidity or counterparty
risks. Every day, ROCKZ holders can order a transfer of their holdings to their bank account
or have them delivered as physical banknotes in Switzerland.
ROCKZ AS A BRIDGE TO THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
Because ROCKZ holders are not necessarily willing to transfer their wealth outside
the cryptosphere but still want to have ready access to their wealth, they can request
ROCKZ to issue, against a pledge of their holdings, guarantees to financial institutions
worldwide. This allows a ROCKZ holder to be recognized as a fiat currency-backed creditor
for their crypto assets in the banking world.
ROCKZ AS COLLATERAL
Because of the cash-like equivalent of ROCKZ, coin holders can use it as collateral to invest
in the crypto world. ROCKZ will always be accepted as a cash equivalent by exchanges.

4.1                                                                                            OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY
The ROCKZ mission is to make the cryptocurrency market transparent, safe and trusted
for its users, so that we can secure the reputation and full potential of blockchain
developments and the cryptosphere for future generations.
ROCKZ is a service, not a commodity. Its success will be measured, not in the extreme
valuations of the coin, but in the number of people who trust it as their ‘port in a storm’.
The objective for ROCKZ is to be widely recognized, trusted and used by both professional
investors and private participants of the new crypto reality. We have a stated aim
of achieving a minimum 3% market share, making ROCKZ an essential part of the cryptosphere
architecture.
4.2                                                                                            SOLUTION IN LAW
The ROCKZ founding team understands that a public adoption of crypto will only happen when
cryptocurrencies adhere fully to the highest standards of regulation. Using light regulatory
environments (offshore) in the hope of circumventing financial regulations is not a viable
and sustainable solution. In order to provide full transparency on our project, the ROCKZ
founding team has decided to fully disclose each and every detail of our setup.
ROCKZ has been set up within Switzerland’s uniquely trusted and enforceable legal
environment. Instead of taking a financial, proprietary risk, the ROCKZ company, ROCKZ AG,
acts purely as a service provider company.
In order to deliver its project, ROCKZ AG has entered into a partnership with a FINMA
regulated Swiss Securities Dealer. The Dealer creates uncertificated securities for ROCKZ
which are registered with SIX Group, the financial infrastructure provider in Switzerland15.
These uncertified securities have an underlying value of 1 CHF.
15 https://www.six-group.com
19




ROCKZ WHITE PAPER
The Dealer creates and sets values for uncertificated securities on a daily basis according
to ROCKZ AG’s requests. Based on inflows and outflows in ROCKZ, the number of uncertificated
securities will increase or reduce on a daily basis. Uncertificated securities are held with
the Dealer by ROCKZ AG, which acts in a fiduciary role for ROCKZ holders.
ROCKZ AG allocates, via a smart contract and the Terms and Conditions of the ROCKZ
platform, one uncertificated security for each ROCKZ coin issued.
Reserves are held on a fiduciary basis, in the name of ROCKZ AG, but for the account
of the ROCKZ holders, with financial intermediaries (banks) and vault operators. ROCKZ AG
segregates reserve holdings from its operational accounts and obtains, where applicable,
an express waiver of the right to offset assets, from financial intermediaries (banks).
In the case of bankruptcy of ROCKZ AG, the Reserves will not be affected by insolvency
proceedings. Coin holders will benefit from the transfer of their rights against ROCKZ AG
to financial intermediaries (banks) and vault operators, as provided under Swiss law16(8).
In such a case, ROCKZ coin holders will be able to get their Swiss Francs directly from
the relevant financial intermediaries (banks) and vault operators.
4.3                                                                                                                      TRANSPARENCY AND COMPLIANCE
Alprockz AG is a Swiss company incorporated in Zug and owned by Swiss-based investors.
Alprockz is launching a Token Generation Event to fund the development of ROCKZ. Alprockz
is audited by VQF Audit AG17.
ROCKZ AG is a Swiss company incorporated in Zug and owned 100% by Alprockz  AG. ROCKZ AG
is issuing ROCKZ tokens. ROCKZ is audited by VQF Audit AG18(10). In accordance with Swiss
AML regulations, ROCKZ AG will be affiliated to a recognised self-regulatory organisation.
On a monthly basis, Reserves are controlled and confirmed by an internationally recognized
company whose reputation is not reliant in any way on the interests of ROCKZ AG.
A confirmation is published to coin holders. In order to ensure a permanent confirmation
process, we consider building a prototype, based on the same mechanics as an ATM, whereby
any ROCKZ client can confirm at any time the amount held in vaults.

SOLUTION ANALYSIS
ROCKZ AG maintains an analysis of select banks and operating vaults and pledges to maintain
a continually updated list of the banks where cash deposits are held. At any time, coin holders
can request the current list of chosen financial intermediaries and vault operators as well
as the guidelines used to select such intermediaries. For security reasons, the vault
operators’ locations are not disclosed.
Cryptocurrency holders and ROCKZ holders go through a standard “know your client”
process (KYC) and payments out of ROCKZ in fiat currencies can only be made to the same
beneficiary as the ROCKZ holder, in order to prevent theft, abuse or fraud.
ROCKZ AG CHF holdings are not invested in any manner and do not bear any interest.
ROCKZ AG will work with regulated trading counterparties primarily based in Switzerland,
in order to work with institutions applying the same level of professionalism, protection
and safety.

The operation process relies on a daily minting / burning of ROCKZ, based on the demand
received via our platform. This is the primary issuance of ROCKZ and a price back of 1 ROCKZ
to 1 CHF is guaranteed at this point.
ROCKZ will eventually also be listed on exchanges as a secondary market. Prices on secondary
markets might deviate from the back to 1 CHF, due to bid and offer.

When a user wants to buy ROCKZ, they must go through the following steps (the KYC
procedure is included whereby a user buys or sells ROCKZ for the first time):
1. The user passes the KYC/AML registration procedure.
2. The user creates an order to buy ROCKZ via the platform interface. The platform
proposes a list of preferred payment types and asks the user to input their Ethereum
address.
3. The user chooses their preferred payment type and makes a payment in ETH, BTC
or CHF.
4. The platform receives payment in ETH or BTC and transforms these into CHF through
brokers or receives CHF directly into its bank account.
5. The bank receives payment and sends this information to the ROCKZ platform
and stores CHF received into the Swiss Francs Reserves. The platform creates an order
for the smart contract to mint new ROCKZ and send them to the user’s registered address.
The ROCKZ platform has a daily cut-off time (12:00 CET) before which it is necessary
to issue/withdraw uncertificated securities, mint/burn ROCKZ and fix price with market
makers. If the user’s order/payment is completed and received before the cut-off time,
the order will be executed. Otherwise, it will be postponed until the next cut-off time.
6. The smart contract mints ROCKZ and sends them to the user’s address; the platform
receives Ethereum transactions data; the user receives their ROCKZ tokens.

4. The user sends ROCKZ to the smart contract address.
5. The platform checks that the tokens were sent to the smart contract address
and makes an order for the nominated bank to pay the user. The bank collects the Swiss
Francs from the Reserve. The ROCKZ platform has a daily cut-off time (12:00 CET) before
which it is necessary to issue/withdraw uncertificated securities, mint/burn ROCKZ
and fix a price with market makers. If the user’s order/payment is received before
the cut-off time, the order will be executed. Otherwise, it will be postponed until the next

ROCKZ AG receives commissions for the services it provides to ROCKZ holders:
- delivery of ROCKZ to coin holders
- delivery of ROCKZ equivalent fiat currency to ROCKZ holders
- delivery of ROCKZ equivalent in banknotes in Switzerland
- coordination with market makers
- partner licenses

ROCKZ is not a technology project per se, but we pride ourselves on having a rock-solid
IT core.
6.1                                                                                             VISION
ROCKZ symbolizes security and safety for the assets of our clients, thus the ROCKZ technical
infrastructure has been developed to ensure a stable and secure base.
In order to develop ROCKZ the founding team and our IT advisors have set up some guiding
principles:
CODE REVIEWS
We will always check and double check: this is in our DNA. Security reviews are included
in our SDLC to protect ROCKZ at the code level. To further ensure code integrity, independent
third party companies conduct regular thorough reviews. Regular penetration tests
will ensure a very high security standard resulting in a hygienic ecosystem. The ROCKZ
infrastructure must be 100% solid, 100% clean.

ROCKZ WHITE PAPER
CLOUD NATIVE
We use only the best and do not duplicate what others can reliably and safely do better.
We use top of the art cluster technology and infrastructure providers to serve you 24/7.
This gives us access to the best people in the field and provides peace of mind.
AUDIT-TRAIL
All access attempts (authorized and non-authorized) are audited and logged in real time,
enabling efficient incident responses and forensic investigations.
AUTO-SCALING
We distribute our services so as to not have any single point of failure, and to balance heavy
/peak loads.
MONITORING
24/7 monitoring  (resource, access, system status, traffic between components, etc.)
and regular health checks ensure a healthy and well-maintained system allowing our teams
to detect and fix issues before they affect users.
PUBLIC BLOCKCHAIN
To fulfill our vision we have decided to use public instead of private blockchain technologies.
This gives us a stable and thoroughly tested architectural base that we believe in,
with millions of highly committed users. As stated by Linus’s Law (Eric S. Raymond):
“Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.”
Our commitment to stability and security is also the reason why ROCKZ are ERC20 compatible
tokens. The Ethereum Foundation and its active arm  (Ethereum Switzerland GmbH)
are both based in Switzerland’s “Crypto-Valley”, but Ethereum is not just another blockchain.
It is a Smart Contract platform which allows it to be used to answer real-world needs.
It is no surprise that the Ethereum blockchain hosts more than                                    81%  of all ICOs.
Moreover, Ethereum is the best way to bring our customers the whole range of our services
as rapidly and as safely possible.
When our ICO Event is successful, we will consider an option to develop our own private
blockchain in the near future to further improve the economics of the ROCKZ system,
and thereby bring ICO members additional privileges and benefits.

The ROCKZ platform has been designed to be as flexible as possible in order to satisfy all
of the needs of its users.
The core of the ROCKZ platform contains all of the functions related to compliance, order
management, the fiat currency rate engine, and client services. The core is backed by reliable
data storage and a distributed backup system, which is necessary in emergency situations
involving hacking attacks, critical code bug errors, or power failure.

ROCKZ WHITE PAPER
The platform is connected with the outer world via several elements:
1. API, used for interconnection with KYC providers and third-party services
(a wide range of merchants and service providers);
2. Web Application, providing direct access to the ROCKZ platform for ROCKZ users;
3. Blockchain Interaction Subsystem, allowing the ROCKZ platform to interact with the Ethereum
blockchain and its smart contracts (to mint new ROCKZ, for example) or other blockchains
in the event that we implement cross-chain functionality;
4. Bank Interaction Subsystem, allowing the ROCKZ platform to coordinate with banks
whenever ROCKZ are converted into a fiat currency and vice versa.This element is designed
to be compatible with commercial bank systems and APIs. Users can interact with banks
via established payment gateways. Access to these gateways will depend on a particular
bank’s preferences. We also discuss with banks the possibility to broadcast the platform’s
Swiss Franc reserves in real-time, along with monthly audit reports, but banks’ security
preferences make that optional.
6.3                                                                                                 SECURITY AND PRIVACY
Our clients’ security and privacy is one of our main concerns. For this reason we are integrating
the best practices and security layers to keep you safe from hackers and prying eyes.
These measures include:
DATA CENTERS
Multiple ultra secure data centers will be used. This includes using data centers built
in bunkers under Swiss mountains to store users’ personal data. Our data centers are ISO
27001:2013, FINMA circular 2008/7, and ISO 9001:2015 compliant. Periodic penetration
tests will be executed by professional hackers.
CLIENT SECURITY AND PRIVACY
Users are the first target for hackers. Our users are secured using MFA (Multi Factor
Authentication) from the beginning. With these technologies, you can add layers to prove
who you are: “Something you are, something you have, something you know”. All clients use
2FA (Two Factor Authentication) by default, which ensures a layer of protection and privacy
for everyone. In subsequent releases, for more sensitive clients, we will propose additional
layers using personal hardware security tokens and/or biometrics, which can be used
to “sign” operations such as changing personal info, selling ROCKZ, etc. Multiple signatures
can be required for corporate accounts and family accounts (multi-signature wallets)
for example. The use of MFA will also be possible in future versions.
28




TECHNOLOGY
COIN SAFETY
We do not store your private keys or act as a wallet. This mitigates risks by allowing you
to be in control and to use the best hardware wallets; hackers cannot steal your coins from
us since we don’t have them.
ENCRYPT EVERYTHING
Data at rest and data in transit. We will use the strongest available encryption algorithms
from point-to-point (no weak link in the chain) and the best key management practices
including specialized hardware security modules (HSMs).
LEAST PRIVILEGE
Only specific roles (AML Officer, Compliance Officer, etc) have access to sensitive or personal
data, for reasons linked to their duty only. All other roles, even administrators, do not have access.
USE SWISS SERVICES
We give priority to Swiss-based companies for all services the platform needs. This ensures
that you are protected under Switzerland’s tight privacy laws. We strive to keep anyone from
snooping on you and your data.
EXTENDED VALIDATION CERTIFICATES (EV SSL/TLS CERTIFICATES)
We protect our site using the strongest TLS certificates available, so that you know
you are safe. EV certificates require extended verification of the requesting entity’s identity
by a certificate authority (CA). This verification adds an extra layer of security. Web browsers
show the verified legal identity (our company’s legal name) so that you know that you are
really on our platform and not that of an imposter.
PLATFORM COMPARTMENTALIZATION
Our platform is designed in a way that gaining access to one part does not allow an attacker to gain
access to all parts. This is the same concept used by the Swiss military when defending the country.
SERVICE AND COMPONENT MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION
Our components and services mutually authenticate each other to ensure that they
communicate only with authorized software.

TOKEN AND TOKEN GENERATING EVENT

                                                                                                 EVENT
8.1                                                                                              TOKENS
Within the framework of the platform, two tokens will function: Alprockz (APZ) and ROCKZ
(RKZ).
Alprockz tokens are ERC-20 tokens issued by Alprockz AG during the ICO. We create Alprockz
as utility tokens that allow users to access the ROCKZ platform and its services: conversion
of ROCKZ into cash, the issuance of Bank cards, and the possibility to use collateralized debt
instruments. We understand that it is unusual to design the platform this way, and that other
stablecoin projects do not use additional tokens to collect funds.
There are reasons why we do this:
1. To comply with modern, more stringent legislation;
2. To raise funds for development of the platform. After two capital increases which have
already taken place, we have decided not to accept the support of specific Private Equity
/ Venture Capital funds and similar organizations, but to reach out to the public directly.
As ROCKZ is designed for investors and users, it is important for us to organize an ICO
and so create a community of, and for, our contributors and users!
APZ tokens, bought during the ICO, will give ICO participants lifelong benefits and bonuses,
including somethat will appear as the platform develops. The existence of the platform
is impossible without Alprockz support.
ROCKZ tokens are ERC-223 tokens that will be issued through the platform after the end
of the ICO according to users’ orders to exchange CHF for tokens. ROCKZ is the base token
of the platform, backed by CHF in the ratio of 1: 1. Accordingly, the token will have a low
volatility due to its being backed by CHF.

TOKEN AND TOKEN GENERATING EVENT
Alprockz liquidity and benefits stability
Contributors who support the platform during the ICO Event and who are holding
Alprockz  tokens  will  receive  additional  benefits  as  the  platform  grows  stronger
and the cryptosphere legal framework becomes more stable and progressive. The ROCKZ
platform team considers this goal to be a matter of honor.
To improve Alprockz liquidity and to make a more profitable offer for our contributors,
just after the ICO Event we will establish the following principles in defining the number
of tokens which should be held by a user in order to obtain holder’s privileges:
1. If the market APZ price is higher than the ICO price, a user has to hold only the APZ
equivalent of the CHF amount needed to access the required option during the ICO.
For example, if the price of the APZ is set at 1.00 CHF, and you have purchased 500 APZ
during the ICO at a price of 0.60 CHF each to get basic access, your total balance
is 500 CHF (500 APZ * 1.00 CHF). You may sell your extra 200 CHF (200 APZ) without
loss of access, because you need only 300 CHF to get basic access.
2. If the current APZ price is lower then the ICO price, a user has to hold the amount
of APZ required for basic access during the ICO. In the example above, if you bought
500 APZ at the price of 0.60 CHF each, and later the market price falls, you would
not need to buy any additional APZ, because you still have 500 APZ in your wallet.
8.3                                                                                          TOKEN ECONOMICS

ROCKZ WHITE PAPER
The principles of token circulation inside the ecosystem are pretty simple. As was mentioned
before, only ROCKZ platform users have access to the platform services. In this case, the ROCKZ
platform becomes a kind of private club, where only members have access to the conversion
of tokens into CHF, and to the transparency and reliability of the service. Meanwhile,
any cryptocurrency user not holding APZ tokens may hold ROCKZ in their portfolio, but without
possibility of conversion into a fiat currency, as this would make the instrument less safe.
The platform is financed by its users, who book cash deliveries to buy or sell ROCKZ tokens,
paying fees for the services. These fees are deducted from the amount transacted.
Fee revenues are used to cover the platform’s costs (audit, bank fees, vaults rent and
construction, development, etc.)
ROCKZ and Alprockz will be available on exchanges, so every user has the possibility to use
the platform’s services.

be increased. Tokens not distributed will be burnt.
