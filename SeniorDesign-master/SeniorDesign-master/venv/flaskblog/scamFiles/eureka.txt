Background
At present, scientific and medical research is typically submitted to be peer reviewed and
then published in academic journals. According to the International Association of Scholarly
Publishing’s market report from 2015, the total market is estimated to be worth over $25
billion USD a year, and of that over $10 billion USD is in the English language. The publishing
industry employs a highly exploitative practice, in particular some of the largest publishers,
with profit margins around 40% after tax. The research publishing industry is dominated by
a small number of publishers that charge high fees to authors to publish. The current system
is exploiting publicly funded research by setting up paywalls to access knowledge that has
been reviewed for free by researchers and frequently paid for with public funds. The vast
majority of research still remains inaccessible to most people on the planet (Piwowar et al.
2018). This has deep and negative consequences for the progress of research, and its wider
use  in  society  to  help  resolve  major  issues  which  affect  the  world’s  economies,  the
environment, and health (Bartling and Fecher 2016).
Blockchain (R)evolution for Scientific Research
The way computer services are organised today has become so second nature to us that we
don’t question it anymore. We know that we have to trust our banks, online social media
platforms,  etc.  Blockchain  technology  approaches  this  issue  differently.  As  the  trust
machine,  a  computer  service  becomes  independent  of  the  control  of  the  underlying
hardware.  Computer  data  becomes  as  trustworthy  as  a  signed  piece  of  paper,  i.e.  a
contract. Computer services become provable and distributed among many systems, which
are two of the major advantages of peer-to-peer networks.
Blockchain has the capacity to make research findings in the digital format immutable,
transparent,  decentralised,  and  distributed.  Besides  initial  experiments  and  data
acquisition, many parts of the research cycle could take place within a blockchain system.
Hypothesis  generation,  discovery,  attribution,  incentivisation  via  smart  contracts,  and
publication and dissemination can all be done on the EUREKA Platform hosted on the
blockchain.  This  bears  the  potential  to  be  a  new  approach  to  resolving  the  current
reproducibility  crisis  in  science,  reducing  waste,  and  making  more  research  results
available. Beyond that, the EUREKA blockchain-based platform could be used to reduce
overhead  costs  and  accelerate  the  scientific  process  and  incentivise  true  innovation
(Bartling and Fecher 2016).
Introduction to ScienceMatters
In late 2015 Sciencematters AG was founded as the next-generation digital platform for
scientists  to  publish  single,  validated  research  observations.  The  current  platform  is
centralised, operational, and revenue-generating. It is an open access digital publishing
platform  that  covers  the  entire  scholarly  publishing  process:  authoring,  submitting,
reviewing, editing and publishing  - all in one unified workflow. ScienceMatters enables
scientists to rapidly publish their results by accepting single observations and leveraging the
powers of modern web-based technologies to help democratise science publishing.

EUREKA brings the Blockchain
EUREKA Blockchain Solutions GmbH (incorporation and registration in process), will become
a provider of technology to publishers both indirectly and directly, and will develop all the
blockchain-based technology to enable a more efficient and trustworthy publishing process
by introducing the EUREKA Platform for timestamping discoveries, rewarding reviewers and
decentralising publishing. Furthermore, the EUREKA token powers the REWARD system,
which supports to solve fundamental issues inherent to the current scientific research
systems. This allows publishing houses, such as ScienceMatters, to be a single observation
publishing house while running their operations over the technology platform provided by
EUREKA  Blockchain  Solutions  GmbH.  Publishing  houses  will  paylicense  fees  to  EUREKA
Blockchain Solutions GmbH for the use and integration of the EUREKA Platform.
ScienceMatters on blockchain - Introduction to the EUREKA Platform
The  EUREKA  Platform,  operated  by  EUREKA  Blockchain  Solutions  GmbH  (incorporation
pending), is a token-operated science publishing ecosystem on a blockchain. Using smart
contracts on the EUREKA Platform, the whole publishing process  - including submission,
reviewing,  rating,  decentralised  publishing  and  funding  decisions  can  be  made  more
efficient.
Problems and Solutions
Academia is facing well-documented serious challenges from current models for scholarly
publishing including:
a) Long delays in publishing research
b) Overreliance of trust in researchers, peer reviewers and publishers that
creates irreproducibility and unreliability in science
c) Absence of fair credit for contribution
Problem 1 - Long Delays in Publishing Research
When researchers make a discovery or observation of scientific or medical value, it can take
many years before it is published. Delays affect the pace of research and slow down the
spread of ideas. Valuable public and private resources, and time are wasted.
●   Inefficient publication process: After assembling research data to form a narrative,
researchers submit it to a scientific journal, where most of the time the paper is
rejected, or revisions are requested, and the authors start the process of submitting
to another journal all over again, making this process extremely inefficient. Each
journal can take between  3 and  24 months  (or sometimes longer) to review a
submitted paper. The publication rate varies amongst journals, but most renowned
6




journals typically have very low publication acceptance rates (often less than 10%).
This affects the dissemination of discoveries.
●                                                                                           Fear of getting scooped: The fact that their work needs be deemed novel at the time
of publication means scientists often do not share their work before publication.
They fear that someone might take their unpublished work and use it without giving
due credit or use it to make new discoveries
before they have been able to extract all of the
potential  value  from it.  The current system
typically  only  publishes  complete  or  full,
positive stories and, consequently, it takes a
long time to finalise a study for publication.
●                                                                                           Many observations that do not fit a narrative
remain  unpublished:  Traditional  publishers
demand  that  only  story-based  studies  be
accepted  for  publication.  Therefore,  researchers  often  omit  findings  in  their
research papers that are not relevant to them or that contradict the narrative.
Authors  wishing  to  publish  are  unable  to  be  fully  objective  towards  their  own
research, and they may overestimate the validity of their data in order to create a
story. Authors are also trusted to remain objective in the face of hypothesis-defying
results and to interpret the data carefully and objectively. One large market segment
that remains untapped at present is the huge volume of unpublished scientific
research.

Journals publish

novelty
worthy results”
-                                                                                           Experimental / no
resources to make it
publishing worthy
90 % of scientific data is never published
•   Closed Science: There are long delays in publishing, combined with the long times
needed to make narratives from simple observations and the reluctance to share
unpublished  work.  While  there  are  initiatives  in  open  science  emerging,  the
widespread adoption of such technologies has been slow. One notable limitation is
the current science publishing system, which arose at a time when ‘closed science’
7




policies of private data, confidentiality, and restricted access were the norm. Today,
multi-billion-dollar publishing companies actively perpetuate these ‘closed science’
policies, which lie at the heart of their business models.
Solution 1: Rapid publication of single observations and preprints on
the blockchain
The  EUREKA  Platform  will  ensure  rapid  publication  of  quality  research.  Authors  and
academic institutions will be able to publish research meta data immediately in the open
access  EUREKA  Platform.  The  research  meta  data  is  timestamped  and  added  to  the
blockchain. The reviewing is performed later and submitted to the smart contract. The cost
to  publish  a  single  observation  on  the  open  access  EUREKA  Platform  will  remain
competitively priced and lower than other open access journals. By using a blockchain-based
system the EUREKA Platform will be highly efficient, rapid, and scalable, thus reducing
overhead. The potential market for the EUREKA Platform is substantial and global. The
platform will cover multiple fields including life science, medicine, engineering and social
sciences, thus further increasing the potential market for the platform.
Problem 2 - Overreliance of trust in researchers, peer reviewers and
publishers that creates irreproducibility and unreliability in science
The  present  system  is  insufficiently  objective  as  it  relies,  at  each  stage,  on  certain
assumptions, trust and good faith.

Overreliance of trust in the authors: In the current system, authors wishing to publish are
unable to be fully objective with their own research, and may overestimate the validity of
their data in order to create a story that is deemed suitable or novel enough for publication.
Since most of the data that is obtained by researchers and authors is in a centralised system
such as on their local server or computer, data can be manipulated or changed to sell the
best narrative. Authors are also trusted to remain objective in the face of hypothesis-defying
results and to interpret the data carefully and objectively. However, some scientists do take
advantage of the present situation to manipulate data to varying degrees and thus corrupt
the system. Scientists feel the pressure to omit ‘inconvenient truths’ that interfere with
their developing storyline as the system demands narratives, rather than science in order to
publish.  This  also  leads  to  irreproducibility.  Estimates  are  that  around  two  thirds  of
published work is not reproducible. (Economist 2013) (“Opinion | Scientists Who Cheat”
2015) (“Fraud in the Scientific Literature” 2012)
According to a survey of 1500 scientists
conducted by the science journal
Nature, more than 70% have been
unable to reproduce another scientist’s
experiments. Even more worrying, over
50% of those surveyed were unable to
reproduce their own experiments. As a
result, much time and billions of dollars
are wasted pursuing drug candidates
that have already been found in
unpublished research not to be
effective. This is what is known as the
‘reproducibility’ crisis. It is estimated
that in the US alone, pharmaceutical
Figure:   https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-
companies waste $28 billion annually
the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970
on irreproducible life sciences
research. The top ten biopharma companies spent $63 billion on Research and
Development in 2016. Being able to reproduce results is one of the cornerstones of high
quality science. However, most journals are not interested in publishing reproduced
results, as they are deemed to have low commercial value.
●   Scientists are unable to easily verify whether a finding is true or not.
●   A substantial amount of research, which could contribute massively to the scientific
world and society at large whole is wasted and never published.
●   Money, resources, and time are wasted trying to perform analyses and gather data
that have been done before, but simply never published.
Overreliance of trust in the peer review system: Peer review is fundamental to scientific
research and publishing. It forms the basis for quality control of academic research, by
having scientists in the same field review each other's work and provide feedback to help
decide if the research should be published or not. However, it is unclear whether it meets
these simple requirements, and there is large potential for disruptive innovation in this area
(Tennant et al. 2017).

●   Bias: Editors and reviewers know the identity of the authors, and as editors and
reviewers are typically in the same field, they frequently know each other
personally. This opens the peer review system to potential personal, professional
and social bias, both intentional and unintentional.
●   Wasteful: Often, manuscripts must go through repeated rounds of the ‘reject and
resubmit’ cycle at different journals as researchers search for a publication venue.
This delays the communication of research while exposing redundancy in the process,
as these reviews will often never be shared or used.
Over-reliance of trust in the publishers: control of the middlemen: Publishers profit from
publicly funded research, which they have not directly paid for. The cost and risk of publicly
funded research is therefore often on the taxpayer.
●   Publishers demand that only story-based studies be published. Therefore, many
observations that do not fit a narrative remain unpublished. During a research study,
researchers make observations and discoveries which for various reasons are not
published. Observations may be unrelated to the researcher’s area of study, resulting
in the researcher not including it in the research paper as it is not relevant to them
and it would  cost more  money to undertake  additional  research  to  investigate
further. The researcher may not understand the importance of their finding, or the
finding may be interesting  but run  counter  to the narrative  of  the  article  the
researcher is writing  (McCook  2016)  (“Why Publish Single Observations? Because
Science Matters” 2016).
●   Because of the  “publish or perish” culture in academia, there are a number of
predatory  publishers  who put profit before quality of  the manuscripts  and this
corrupts scientific literature (“Website” n.d.) (Beall 2012).
Solution 2: Blockchain-based timestamping and peer reviewing
EUREKA Blockchain Solution GmbH’s first client, Sciencematters AG, currently institutes a
triple-blind peer review system that aims to eliminate personal, professional, and social
bias, in which the identity of authors, of editors and of reviewers are unknown to all. As a
result, they evaluate each observation solely on its merits, without regard to the authors’
reputations, identities, institutions, gender, race, or nationality. Sciencematters AG also
improves the peer review process by scoring observations on a 0-10 scale rather than the
non-quantitative and somewhat meaningless ‘thumbs-up, thumbs-down’ approach of other
journals.
The EUREKA Platform will provide researchers with additional benefits such as enhanced
preprint service, which will include decentralised, crowdsourced open peer reviews as well
as expert opinion and feedback paid in EUREKA tokens and timestamped on the EUREKA
Platform. Preprints will be citable and will ensure that researchers who make discoveries
get  the  credit  they  deserve.  In  this  way,  we  necessitate  the  placing  of  trust  in  a
decentralised manner on authors, reviewers or publishers.
10




Problem 3 - Absence of fair credit for contribution
Typically, both authors and reviewers currently get almost no direct compensation for the
scholarly work that they perform in publishing and reviewing. The high cost to publish peer
reviewed research means researchers have a barrier to publish and share knowledge with
society and the scientific community. To publish in the largest traditional journals, authors
often have to pay APCs (article processing charges) of over $5000 USD.
Reviewers conduct peer reviews without receiving a fee or any other form of compensation
for their time and effort. Despite of the fact that valuable time is needed to conduct peer
reviews, reviewers frequently don't allocate sufficient hours to properly assess the quality
of the research.
Solution 3 - Smart Contract-based Payment of Peer Reviewers and
Editors
Currently, only few publishing houses such as Sciencematters AG pay editors and reviewers
part of the article processing charges. Interestingly, while there are tens of thousands of
journals, only four of these pay reviewers, and Sciencematters AG is one of them.
The EUREKA Platform will bring, compared to current structures, much required speed,
reproducibility, democracy and honesty to science publishing; accelerating the pace of
research, and thereby improving the entire scientific enterprise. Through smart contracts,
the editors and reviewers who carry out the quality control of each study, can now be
autonomously and automatically paid.
11




Stakeholders
Authors: The scientists and researchers who conduct research and wish to publish and share
their research in peer reviewed journals.
Researchers: Scientists who need access to research to study other researcher’s findings.
Open access publishers: The first of which will be Sciencematters AG.
Academic institutions: Often the cost for an author to publish in academic journals is paid
for by academic institutions. Institutions are also charged subscription fees to access the
same journals.
Governments: Research is funded with public grants and contracts.
NGOs: Charitable foundations, trusts, funders of research.
Private enterprises: The private sector develops applications, drugs, and technologies based
on prior research. Firms fund research, conduct studies in house and collaborate with
academic institutions.
General Public: Individuals and corporations fund research through their taxes, and in turn
benefit from scientific and medical discoveries.
Funding agencies and institutions: Entities which fund research, and which are indispensable
for a viable proposal of a research project.

Revelation - Timestamping of Discoveries in the Early Stages to Avoid Getting Scooped and
Prevent Tampering
Scientific observations and the author’s research topic will be timestamped, hashed and
recorded on the public Ethereum blockchain. This gives the author or inventor immediate
ownership rights. This ensures that scientists’ and researchers’ discoveries are tamper-
proof. This has important ramifications for protecting intellectual property, preventing
‘scooping’ and helps to avoid delays in discovery and communication, as well as data
manipulation and delays.
12




Evaluation: Peer-to-Peer Evaluation of Observations and Preprints
Once  registered  on  the  EUREKA  Platform,  single  observations  and  narrative  preprints
undergo crowdsourced, peer-to-peer reviews which are transmitted and recorded on the
EUREKA Platform. Single observations are subject to triple-blind peer evaluation where
authors, reviewers and editors are unaware of the identity of each another. Preprints of
manuscripts, on the other hand, will follow a two-step open peer review process, first by
researchers in training who will evaluate the work and add their annotations, focusing
mostly on technical details. This is followed by a formal review of the annotated work by
select experts in the field in question, who take the annotated comments into account when
giving expert rating and review. The EUREKA Platform will make use of crowdsourced
wisdom. It will also allow reviewers to get fast, accurate evaluations of the work, instead
of being restricted to one or two reviewers, as is common practice. Reviewers will be
compensated in EUREKA tokens for their work.
Having research available in the public domain offers the following advantages:
a) it allows real-time, scientific self-correction and peer review of the research
b) it eliminates the hindering of scientific progress caused by delays in scientific publishing.
13




Worth Assignment: Rating and Review
Following review, each manuscript will be rated based on:
1) Technical quality
2) Scientific impact
3) Societal impact
4) Creativity and novelty
5) Robustness
The EUREKA Platform’s crowdsourced scoring of preprints will provide researchers as well
as publishers with a new metric that can be used to evaluate submissions more swiftly thus
speeding up the publication process. With both crowdsourced annotation and expert-guided
peer-review, our scores are, and will be, more reliable and representative. Our review
process will also allow authors to appropriately revise and improve the paper. Once the
paper is revised, final review and ratings will be openly appended to the preprints. These
preprints or observations with ratings and reviews will be archived through the EUREKA
decentralised and distributed system. In cases where the author wants to publish in a
traditional journal, the scores can be transferred to the journals. These scores are also
available to funders, universities and prize or awards committees.
Decentralised archiving: Publishing on EUREKA’s blockchain-based platform ensures that
research  meta  data                                                                           (no  personal  information)  is  immutable,  timestamped,  version
controlled, and securely distributed. This will provide an ideal system for research data
management that lessens the need to rely on trust alone in publishers and authors. All the
processes and outputs (e.g. data, protocols, code) are all open and transparent, therefore
ensuring maximum visibility and verification.
We  can  maximise  access  to  research  without  putting  up  barriers.  Using  blockchain
technology, we can reduce instances of single points of failure. Researchers themselves are
fully in control of the entire process of dissemination. There is no risk of the information
ever disappearing, due to the distributed nature of blockchain.
14




Award: Funding, Career Advancements and Awards
Decisions on career advancement, tenure, funding, and awards are all mainly based on
where the research is published, resulting in pressure on researchers to publish in traditional
“high impact” journals. EUREKA will have the first blockchain-based scientific rating system,
preprint server, and single observation platform that provide reliable, immutable scores on
research data that can be transferred on the blockchain to funders, institutions and directly
to journals.
Decisions on funding: Since the EUREKA Platform will use crowdsourced annotation and
expert peer review ratings, the scores are more reliable and representative. Thus, sources
of funding could make decisions based on ratings and reviews on the EUREKA Platform.
Decisions on career advancements: Scores and ratings of a specific study for which the
research meta data has been recorded on the EUREKA Platform can be transferred to
institutions and universities to be used when a researcher is considered for promotion,
tenure, or awards. The current evaluation for career advancement based on traditional
publishing and its journal-based metrics could be replaced by preprints with EUREKA ratings.
Decisions on awards and prizes: Several academic prizes, including the famous Nobel Prize,
the Breakthrough Prize, and the Lasker Prize are awarded to outstanding researchers. The
evaluation  process  for  these  prizes  takes  into  account  where  the  authors  have  been
published and thus our rating and review system on research data could eventually form
part of the criteria for selection. The award committee could also take into account both
the crowdsourced annotation as well expert-guided reviews and ratings as opposed to the
current way of simply judging where a work has been published.
Note: No personal information of any person involved in the process of the EUREKA Platform will be stored on the public
Ethereum blockchain. Only scientific observations and the author’s research topic will be timestamped, hashed and recorded
on the public Ethereum blockchain
15




Replication
A decentralised peer-to-peer review system based on smart contracts fosters a collaborative
environment and incentivises replication research to either confirm or contradict existing
studies. This ensures the reproducibility of findings. And it minimises wasteful time and
financial spending. We envisage a scenario where EUREKA tokens are allocated to pay for
replication studies. Researchers confirm the study, and both the original author and the
replicating  author  are  automatically  compensated  with  EUREKA  tokens  by  the  smart
contract interacting with the EUREKA Platform.
Data Analytics
An artificial intelligence-based prediction tool will make use of proprietary algorithms which
will identify related studies and observations by cross referencing annotations and link them
to  form  a  narrative.  This  technology  could  be  leveraged  to  predict  targets  for  drug
development.
The EUREKA Platform ensures that its content is archived through a distributed server
network. Raw data is accessible on the platform and sharing is encouraged from all authors.
Due to the importance of data in research, the sharing of raw data will soon be a mandatory
part  of  each  submission.  Automated  data  analysis  tools  using  data  templates  will  be
developed to encourage community-based evaluation of raw and formatted data.
16




White Labelling of the Platform and Licensing of the Blockchain-Based
Publishing Technology
The EUREKA publishing platform will be licensed for use by societies and universities as a
“white  label”  product,  branded  with  names  of  institutions  and  logos  and  marked  as
“powered by EUREKA Platform”.
Research Data Management Platform
A platform where researchers can record their data, and then easily submit them for peer
review or combine them into manuscripts to be published as preprints.
Data Analytics
An AI-based system that will provide analysis of datasets, suggest publications for citations
or similarities by scanning annotations and keywords. A statistical analysis tool that will help
detect plagiarism and mathematical errors in data.
Funding Platform
A platform to both award and request funding on a peer-to-peer and decentralised basis for
scientific research, prizes for solving scientific problems, using EUREKA tokens.
Research Related Marketplace
An online marketplace where scientists and firms can buy and sell research related products
and services in a decentralized and direct manner with EUREKA token.

Use Cases
Use Case 1: A researcher in a remote part of the world discovers a
potential new drug or extract but cannot publish this observation
Under  the current publishing system,  Alexander  Fleming  could  not have  published  his
discovery of penicillin. Often in science, the implications of a discovery are not immediately
apparent. It is doubtful that Benjamin Franklin could have perceived the multiple uses of
electricity when he first discovered it. By providing a platform for single observations to be
published, scientists can take credit for the initial discovery, enabling other scientists and
researchers to then build on their findings. Due to the low percentage of scientific research
that is ultimately published, there may well be important scientific discoveries that have
already been made but are as of yet unpublished.
Use Case 2: A researcher from an established research institute delays
publication of their findings for several years
The existing system in academia incentivises researchers to delay publishing research until
they have a sufficiently large ‘story’ in order to further their careers. As a result, several
years can pass until important findings are published. A researcher can instead publish
multiple single observations on the EUREKA Platform, giving other scientists the chance to
incorporate these observations into their own research. As the single observations are
recorded and timestamped on the blockchain, the researcher can take credit for their work
immediately. This will be especially useful for junior researchers looking to make an early
mark on their careers.
Use Case 3: Scientists have neither the time to conduct peer reviews,
nor are they incentivised to do so financially
Peer review is a time consuming and unrewarded task expected from scientists. On the
EUREKA Platform, by enabling smart-contract based payments, reviewers will be rewarded
for conducting peer reviews in tokens. ScienceMatters is the first client to implement this
technology. Today, ScienceMatters is one of the few publishing houses which rewards peer
reviewing  financially,  however,  using  fiat payments  results  in high fees  and delays  in
payments. On the EUREKA Platform, tokens will be used to incentivise review with fast and
fair payment.
Use Case  4: An author contributes an idea, however, this author
doesn’t receive any form of financial reward in the event that the idea
is used by a third party
Discoveries from publicly funded research are currently published in journals that then
profit from the publication of the findings, while authors are not rewarded. The EUREKA
18




Platform will directly reward authors with EUREKA tokens, whose work is later used by
others.
Use Case 5: A marketplace for matching research ideas with funding
Problem 1: In the USA in 2009, $200 million was set aside for 200 “challenge grants” for
high risk research projects. The agency involved (National Institutes of Health) was
overwhelmed by over 21,000 applications which it was not equipped to process. Using the
EUREKA Platform, the above bottleneck could have been solved.
Problem 2: Funding agencies currently rely heavily on peer reviews in journals when making
funding decisions. In order to apply for funding, researchers must cite published work to
support their applications. Due to the publication bias already described, researchers are
unwittingly applying for grants for research which has already been disproved by other
researchers. These new researchers then encounter the same issues and are unable to
publish their negative results. And so, the cycle of wasting time and money continues.
Solution: The EUREKA Platform will bring researchers who have great ideas and micro-
proposals directly in contact with funding agencies, individual funders, investors who are
interested in funding new ideas. The process of vetting proposals will be done through a
voting process, which will allow qualified researchers to upvote and downvote proposals and
leave comments.
Technology
Although, the blockchain-based system aims for decentralisation, a centralised backend
provides  a  convenience  layer  to  access  the  blockchain.  Besides  this  backend,  the
infrastructure consists of a frontend part and a blockchain part. The frontend is a web-
browser that gets its content from the backend. The frontend needs to have MetaMask
installed  which  provides  a  web3  interface  to  Ethereum.  Further  technical  details  are
presented in the technical white paper.

Token Flow
The Importance of Fibonacci to Science and its Relation to the EUREKA ICO Hard Cap
What is now known as the Fibonacci sequence was first mentioned by the Indian scholar
Pingala around 200 B.C.E.
In 1202 C.E. the Italian mathematician Fibonacci described exponential growth in a rabbit
population in his book Liber Abaci. The sequence of numbers he described and now named
after Fibonacci is calculated by adding the two preceding numbers. This sequence is seen
throughout nature; governing the spirals of galaxies, the distribution of flower petals, and
21




even the human X chromosome inheritance tree. In computer science, Fibonacci numbers
have been used in algorithms such as polyphase merge sort and lossy compression.
Due to the omnipresence of the Fibonacci sequence in nature and its importance to science,
as  a  tribute,  the  hard  cap  chosen  for  the  EUREKA                                             ICO  is  the  36th   Fibonacci     number:

Business model and Revenue Streams of EUREKA Services
EUREKA has a SaaS (software as a service) business model in which the technology remains
under EUREKA’s ownership while customers pay for software usage. The software services
are bundled (freemium) into packages differentiating by value adding functionalities and
services (see bullet points below). Customers pay either on a monthly, yearly, or multi-
yearly subscription to use the software and additional services whilst receiving either
EUREKA’s publishing services and/or data analytics services. The following revenue
streams are envisioned:
•   White labelling platform to set up single observation journals. Pay per number of
articles submitted, amount of access, or editing services.
•   Offering one-click journal/conference rating platform via the EUREKA convenience
layer including data analytics. Revenues are generated from fees.
•   Integrating EUREKA to existing scientific conference management systems enabling
additional services for those systems. Revenues are generated from fees.
•   Further revenue streams envisioned e.g., by providing a funding platform or
sponsoring best paper awards with EUREKA tokens in exchange of small fee for
each reference.

EUREKA tokens will automatically go to the active token holders in proportion to
the stake or share of total EKA in circulation that is owned by the holder. This will
be on a continual basis and the loyalty bonus is allocated to the holder whenever
the token holder makes a transaction in EKA. To qualify as an active token holder,
the token holder needs to have made one transfer or transaction in EKA in the
preceding 12 months, which means transferring EKA from one wallet to another.
The entitlement to the loyalty bonus accrued since the last EKA transaction and
will be paid out automatically and simultaneously to the active token holder each
time a holder makes a transaction in EKA. After 12 months of inactivity, defined as
a EKA token holder making no transactions in EKA, the token holder forfeits any
loyalty bonus accrued during the inactive period, and it will be redistributed to the
loyalty bonus pool until they are deemed to be active again.

Solutions GmbH to purchase EKA tokens, and these tokens may be distributed to
active holders as a loyalty bonus at the discretion of EUREKA Blockchain Solutions
GmbH.
2Example: A scientific conference management   system that manages 100 conferences per year, each conference with 50
publications, and 50% of the conferences are EUREKA-enabled. If an author pays 500 EKA submission fees (assuming 1 EKA =
1 USD), the volume is 1.25 million EKA, 1% is 12’500 EKA, which will be distributed among the active token holders.

Token Buying Process
Whitelisted investors will be able to buy EUREKA tokens on the www.eurekatoken.io site
using ETH or BTC. The aim is to also accept fiat currency, discussions with banking partners
are underway. Due to Swiss law, all investors will need to pass KYC and AML requirements
and these will be implemented by a third party. EKA tokens can only be transferred to ERC20
compatible wallets.
24




Compliance and Regulatory
EUREKA Blockchain Solutions GmbH and its ICO are governed by the laws of Switzerland and
international financial regulations. To comply with Swiss banking law, all participants in the
ICO will need to pass checks for ID, address and in some cases provide proof of funds.
Sciencematters EUREKA Foundation
The Sciencematters EUREKA Foundation’s (not yet established) purpose will be to promote
open and reproducible science. The Foundation will conduct an annual conference, inviting
researchers from both academia and industry to discuss cutting edge research and to present
the Annual Awards.
Roadmap
EUREKA Blockchain Solutions GmbH will use a portion of the funds raised through the token
sale to further develop the platform in 5 phases (Phases 1-5), beyond the current operations
(Phase 0).
Phase 0: Current Operations
The platform so far and the team behind EUREKA Blockchain Solutions GmbH have published
over  100 triple-blind peer reviewed articles in the journal Matters and Matters Select,
submitted and paid for by scientific researchers (and their institutes) on the ScienceMatters
platform.
Authors  can  write  directly  on                                                                Each                    manuscript                           has   a                       All  articles  on  ScienceMatters

process faster and cheaper
In addition to Matters and Matters Select, which are journals dedicated to single observation
publishing, ScienceMatters will launch two new open access journals based on existing
technology in Q4 of 2018:
25




●   Hypothesis Matters, which will allow scientists to publish their hypotheses, which
are the first steps in scientific research.
●   Reproducibility Matters, which will publish confirmatory and contradictory data.
EUREKA Blockchain Solutions GmbH will conduct a limited private token sale to a select few
investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts who are already familiar with Sciencematters AG’s
solution, its founder and team. The proceeds of which will be used to fund the promotion
and community building necessary for the pre-ICO.
Phase 1: Pre-ICO
EUREKA Blockchain Solutions GmbH will move to the pre-ICO phase, which will include the
following:
Code, Testing and Quality Assurance: A bug bounty programme for our ICO code will be
announced. Code will be available on GitHub. Security audits will be carried out.
PR, Marketing and Bounty Programme: An extensive marketing campaign and bounty
programme will be launched to reach out to potential ICO investors. The bounty programme
will reward promoters of the EUREKA ICO. The foundations for a global community of
supporters  of  EUREKA  Blockchain  Solutions  GmbH’s  mission  of  democratising  scientific
research will be built.
ICO Website: The site for the ICO will be launched. As well as featuring detailed information
on the blockchain applications, cryptonomics and security of the ICO, this website will
feature video testimonials from existing users. These researchers will talk about their
reasons for publishing on the Sciencematters AG's platform, and their experience of using
the platform, which will be the first client to integrate the EUREKA Platform.
Phase 2: ICO
Public ICO: EUREKA Blockchain Solutions GmbH will sell the EUREKA tokens to the public.
The minting and distribution of the EUREKA tokens will finish in the same quarter.
Blockchain prototype programming: Kick-off for building a smart contract that allows peer
review on the blockchain.
Blockchain  timestamping:  For  submission  of  observations  and  major  changes  to  the
database will be implemented.
Sign up editors and reviewers: Recruitment of editors from existing reviewer pool and
outside as volunteers to participate in beta phase of the blockchain prototype.
Phase 3: Testnet Launch and Expansion
Testnet Launch: On completion of Phase 2 EUREKA Blockchain Solutions GmbH will launch
a peer review smart contract in a testnet.
26




Expansion into new fields: Preparation for expansion will commence by recruiting editors
from social sciences, humanities, and engineering.
Launch of Hypothesis Matters which will allow scientists to publish their hypotheses, which
are the first steps in scientific research. Authors will be able to publish hypotheses, claims
and proposals that will be peer-reviewed by two groups: the expert group comprising of
researchers and the impact group comprising of people potentially impacted by the field
and the whole process is tokenised through our EUREKA Platform.
Launch of Reproducibility Matters which will publish confirmatory and contradictory data.
In the case of Reproducibility Matters, when an observation is faithfully replicated, then the
authors of the original observation and the authors who replicated get some tokens as
incentives and in the case the observation cannot be replicated, we the authors who
replicated the study get tokens. The replicating observations are all linked and are visualised
through the MattericTM, the metric IP from Sciencematters AG.
Phase 4: Launch and deployment of the mainnet
Mainnet launch: At the start of  2019, once beta testing has been completed, the final
blockchain publishing product will be released on the Ethereum mainnet.
Marketing Campaign: A marketing and advertising campaign will be launched to increase
awareness and usage of the platform. Versions of the platform will be released tailored to
the needs of other fields, such as social sciences, humanities and engineering.
Localisation: Translation of the platform into Chinese and other languages in order to
increase the potential market and audience.
Partnerships with scientific societies and associations will be further developed.
Launch of Blockchain Matters which is the first journal publication on the blockchain which
focuses on study of blockchain. This publication is a significant step towards realising the
EUREKA  mission  of  democratising  science  through  decentralisation  and  transparency.
Blockchain Matters not only adds to much needed academic discourse about blockchain but
it is actually on the blockchain.
Phase 5: Deployment of the EUREKA Platform
White label the publishing platform
Managing funding proposals
Research data management on the blockchain
Marketplace matching funders with peer reviewed funding proposals
