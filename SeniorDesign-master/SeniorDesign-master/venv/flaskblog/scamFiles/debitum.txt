Preface
Very soon, Susan, who runs a small dry cleaning shop in Bangkok,
will find herself engaged in a small conversation with a client,
hoping to distract herself from the boredom of her day.
“It was, like, the whitest and softest shirt of my life, the one I
cleaned here” the client tells her happily.
“I will recommend your place to our administrative director.”
Soon  enough,  Susan  is  looking  at  a  copy  of  the  massive
outstanding invoice of hers, the order behind it being from
the entire corps diplomatique, ten times beyond her current
capacity. The money is hers but not quite yet — she must wait
for up to 120 days. She neither has the working capital needed
at the moment nor a lack of willpower to keep the client by all
means.
Perhaps she could use some traditional extended overdraft,
but to get financing, businesses often have to struggle through
an  inadequate  ‘presumption  of  guilt’  with  ‘judges’  [salaried
non-entrepreneurs]  unwilling  to  listen.  Good  borrowers  are
in a position to prove that two plus two isn’t five and remain
unfinanced, albeit the whole point for institutional financiers
to exist in this fundamentally inflationary economy is to ensure
the maximum circulation of capital. While alternative financing
channels  have  emerged  as  a  necessary  measure,  effective
international  marketplaces  and  transparent  pledge  security
registries have not been developed.

“When I work hard, when my clients respect me and
I receive large orders from them, the idea that my
business has problems with accountability sends me
into angry fits,” Susan told a friend of hers, Mario.
He shared an idea with Susan: large businesses spend a lot of
money trying to predict the eventual cost of capital and the
cash flow, but you should use the power of an open market—
Debitum. In a matter of minutes, Susan turns her invoice in and
receives her funding while associated interest and charges start
travelling as a cryptocurrency that is liquidly trading in pairs to
major fiat and cryptocurrencies. Thus, the market tariffs her
on the prediction of when the client will pay and provides the
money immediately. The open-source, distributed network of
hundreds of local debt validators and millions of global loan
providers quickly makes up a customized offer for Susan.
Mario was the right guy to ask because back in his days of glory,
having him on vacation seemed too stressful for the entire
domestic financial community. When he was on leave from his
office at the Anti-Fraud Dept., financiers could expect bizarre
and disturbing developmentsto occur at any moment. Picture
this: a local exporter issues a large invoice to a foreign buyer and
offers it to several invoice financing firms, receiving funds from
at least three and cashing in 0.8x3=2.4 of the invoice sum. While
one financier later receives the payment from the buyer, others
don’t. As the exporter goes bankrupt, the question arises: who
has secured the buyer’s payment in the first place? The financier
who’s got the money is in trouble too, because the other firm
has secured the receivable with tax authorities and has the real
https://debitum.network                                                6




case to claim. What makes it even worse is that the buyer makes
a mistake and double-pays upon the same invoice to the seller.
Not to mention the buyer never gets his goodsdelivered.
The gallows humor of this story is that a person like Mario has
never existed to prevent frauds, nor is he around to advise a yet
inexistent but highly demanded service like Debitum.

Global credit gap
In accordance with the World Bank’s review, approximately 70% of all micro, small
and medium-sized enterprises in emerging markets lack access to credit. At the
same time, the small and medium-sized businesses stratum is the most promising
target audience for financiers. Among industry experts, small business finance is
considered today as a globalissue worth addressing — formally registered small
businesses account for more than half of the GDP in developedcountries.
SMEs growth globally is capped by inflexible local financing, creating $2 trillion
credit gap worldwide as accounted by IFC, the World Bank organization:

The data accounts only for formal SMEs; however, the World Bank estimated that
informal companies worldwide have additional credit gap of around $1 trillion.
Moreover, one must understand that potential of offering new finance instruments
also exists in developed countries not officially accounted for having a credit gap.
https://debitum.network                                                                9




Hence the total market opportunity may well be larger than the $1.538 trillion
noted as unserved or underserved by the World Bank.
Alternative finance industry
Why the traditional banking industry established more than 600 years ago is not
able to solve the outstanding credit gap? Both banks and small businesses are
responsible.
The banks are responsible for cherry picking and mostly working with less risky and
larger businesses due to low risk tolerance of traditional finance industry. As there
are so many legacy solutions in banking industry, mostly inflexible and standardized
terms are used, it is very costly for banks to serve each individual customer. Thus
banks are trying to maximize their income (interest and fees) from each individual
business case by working on larger business cases.
Also the abundance of local banks — where a fellow banker would be familiar with
a local business — is a thing of the past. For example, 30 years ago, in 1984 there
were 14 400 commercial banks in USA; however, today there are only 4 982 banks
left. Such decline of individual banks can be explained by centralization that brings
more internal regulations and centralized processes, making it harder for banks to
serve small, local companies.
On the other hand, in a small company, finances are normally taken care of by
owners, not by dedicated professionals. Good financial management is rarely a core
strength of a small business. Actually, accessing external finance is often named as
the poorest area of expertise.
https://debitum.network                                                                 10




The industry that has taken the challenge to solve the problem up is often referred
to as ‘alternative finance’. As the name itself suggests, alternative finance is when
someone borrows money or sells equity, choosing an option to go a non-traditional,
non-institutional route.
Alternative finance is an umbrella term for various financing options such as peer-
to-peer lending (P2P), crowdfunding, balance-sheet lending, , invoice trading (loans
backed by account receivables), supply chain finance, reverse factoring, merchant
loans, VAT financing, and others. No single institution, company, or regulator covers
all business spheres in alternative finance. Some of largest alternative finance
companies are Zopa in UK (market size of xxx USD), LendingClub in USA (market
size of xxx USD) or CreditEase in China (market size ofxxx USD).
Such alternative finance services usually ensure initial initial access to financing for
SMEs by providing services and financing when traditional banks would not. In long
term financing received via alternative finance services allows SMEs to grow and
to become “bankable”, hence being able to access traditional finance instruments.
Hence the alternative finance industry is operating as a bridge financing that allows
business to grow and reach the riskless requirements of clumbersome traditional
finance industry. In essence filling the gap between what strongly constrained and
strictly regulated traditional institutions such as banks can offer and what individuals
or some smaller businesses can possibly comply with.
Flexibility is key, but a great deal of the business essence also comes from the
effectiveness of online operations and the idea of crowdsourcing. Another reason
why alternative finance is booming might be that investors have grown educated
enough to not be happy with allowing banks to earn on their money and pay out
only marginal interest rates. Many people feel it is worthwhile to get connected
with borrowers directly. Last but not the least, unlike traditional institutions, who do
much of the work manually and do not share data concerning the risk assessment,
alternative financiers are highly automated and interconnected which gives them
an additional competitive advantage.
https://debitum.network                                                                    11




Besides easier access to funding, an important benefit of alternative financing is
its higher speed of operations and convenience. Of course, most of the business
is done online, paperwork is minimum, and funds are usually made available in a
matter of hours or days, which in all cases is significantly quicker as compared to
banks.
The World Bank recently estimated that the world’s alternative finance market
could grow to $90 billion of investment by 2020 from $34 billion at present. As
banks see increasingly stricter regulatory burdens, both investors and SMEs will
seek other financial solutions.
Globalization of available capital
As the enormous credit gap is still there and growing, we should admit the incumbent
solution is not likely to cope with the problem, so a different approach is required.
The decentralization of lending, and the continued disruption to financial services,
therefore, looks set to continue narrowing of the credit gap for SMEs.
There is a lot of capital available to be invested in various finance instruments or lent
for interest throughout the developed world. Available capital for lending; however,
is limited in less developed parts of the world - the same parts that experience the
credit gap indicated by the World Bank. There is a mismatch between geographical
availability of capital and local businesses.
Partly the geographical mismatch is being solved by many alternative finance
companies, especially marketplaces and P2P platforms (KPMG global survey in
2015 shows 1086 alternative finance platforms). However, many of them operate
in a single or limited markets (most often up to 10 countries), many of them in the
developed world like USA, UK, France, Germany, or the only noteworthy exception
- China.
https://debitum.network                                                                     12




Based on our professional experience it is well understood - different steps of
the financing process are often very specific to local environment. For example,
debt collection procedure in most parts of Eastern Europe is based on German
law and precision of procedures; however, in many countries throughout Southeast
Asia debt collection is based on a notion of shame and public disgrace. Hence to
efficiently move available global capital from the developed part of the world to the
less developed, one must connect it to the local and regional counterparties.
Necessity to decentralize using blockchain
Any solution to meaningfully decrease the existing credit gap requires three main
characteristics: trust, full end-to-end financing process and structure supporting
exponential growth. KPMG in their report on global alternative finance industry
supports this by stating that from 2017 and onward for alternative finance market
to grow and truly become global phenomenon, it needs:
a transparent                                                                              to deal with           to gain distribution
and supportive                                                                             investment failures,   via efficient

framework                                                                                  to ensure confidence
of global investors
incredit assessment
and debt collection
processes
Internet and online marketplace or P2P solutions are trying to allow that; however,
when dealing with different parts of the world trust between counterparties is
more important than technical capability of interconnecting. Traditional non-crypto
market place solutions can’t ensure successful global integration of all local, regional
https://debitum.network                                                                    13




and  global  counterparties.  Why?  Because  existing  centralized  solutions  force
various global counterparties with different cultural and experience backgrounds
to trust a single party running the marketplace. If the central party goes out of
business, most likely investors will not be able to get their investments back directly
from the borrowers. Global problem requires global solution only allowed by the
blockchain technology.
Blockchain by design allows to ensure ultimate transparency and trust, allows to
automate processes by using smart contracts and its decentralized nature allows
for exponential growth of the number of members within any blockchain based
solution.
https://debitum.network                                                                   14




Solution - Debitum Network
Lending money is all about trust and its mechanical gears such as collateral, quantified
reputation, and fear of punishment. Born in already well-established societies, we take
the existing business trust culture for granted; we rarely doubt its basics and address
the quantitative measurements of business friction costs. However, to solve global
credit gap - we should mostly operate in younger countries where business trust is not
granted. Using trust based blockchain solution Debitum Network ensures needed trust
for all counterparties, especially investors, to operate within the ecosystem.
To consider comparatively complex lender-borrower relations, let’s take a step back
and see how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may change and simplify retailer-
consumer interactions. To be able to conveniently pay in all stores, consumers go
to the market of payment instruments where they have a narrow choice of VISA or
Mastercard which are essentially the same.
https://debitum.network                                                                    15




Retailers have more options — Ingenico, Verifone, and a few others—but, since the
interchange fee is still there down the line, that seeming variety does not allow
them to circumvent high costs. Putting its currency and monetary dimensions aside
for now, when Bitcoin, a decentralized payment tool, steps in, it theoretically allows
consumers and retailers to interact with no intermediary, using the free open source
tool. In practice, however, there are ‘Bitcoin operators’ such as a wallet software
or side-chain providers who make life a lot easier without charging monopoly-like
fees.
Three main pillars of the ecosystem
Debitum Network is based on three important pillars that ensure its uniqueness,
disruptiveness as well as will ensure positive results on smalling the credit gap:
https://debitum.network                                                                  16




True decentralization
There are 154 countries indicated by the World Bank where SMEs experience
credit gap and where a solution like Debitum Network could help closing that gap
by providing ecosystem of counterparties and connecting it with global investors.
However, saying that Debitum Network team will just set up in 154 countries and
bring the ecosystem to market on their own would be a fallacy.
As Debitum Network is initial market maker and facilitator for solving worldwide
credit gap by connecting SMEs with global investors who can rely on service provided
by local or regional counterparties, i.e., verification, risk assessment, insurance, debt
collection. It is possible to attract global investors to distribute their available capital
as well as attract SMEs to borrow and finance their growth; however, to make the
whole ecosystem truly decentralized, global and self sustainable service providers
will be organized in ‘communities’.
Communities  are  decentralized  and  truly global,  consisting  of various  service
providers and  ‘institutional borrowers’  - alternative finance companies already
serving SMEs that could attract more global investment and restructure their
portfolio by using Debitum Network.
https://debitum.network                                                                        17




A community consists of one or many local or regional service providers that
work together to ensure service provision. Members of the community can be
both crypto or non-crypto (having a crypto agent) based. Communities will offer
a unique motivation for each individual as well as whole group to become more
trusted as when any service is performed both the individual counterparty and
their community will earn or lose trust rating.
A community leader will get a fee via community’s trust arbitrage smart contract
from each of community’s members activity, hence the leader would be motivated
to develop business and grow the community - thus leading to self sustainable
Debitum Network ecosystem in thelong run.
Borrowers and investors should be excited to have communities within Debitum
Network as they can trust their service to community and whoever is there can
deliver it. On the other hand, it is better for individual counterparty to be a part of
a community as it provides more business opportunities and faster growth via trust
(as community’s trust grows, each counterparty’s trust de facto grows).
Communities are also the ones that take care of resolving issues, marketing their
members, growing the community and other tasks relevant to the community (on
and off the blockchain). Each community will have a community leader who has
additional functions available for community trust arbitrage smart contract.
We believe that using communities is the only way to ensure that needed level
of control is decentralized and closer to the final customers of service providing
counterparties - borrowers and investors. At the same time, such organizational
design provides a lot of freedom to local and regional communities and service
providers. We believe that this is the only way to ensure fast, efficient and stable
global growth of Debitum Network.
https://debitum.network                                                                   18




Setting up a community
Anyone (single or several companies, single or more individuals) who wants to
start a community for service provision within Debitum Network, must implement
Debitum Network Community smart contract interface / API. Additionally, in this
smart contract, the community leader must provide rating calculation algorithm
for community members and provide it for an audit by Debitum Network Trust
Arbitrage to ensure the rating calculation fits local specifics and are objective and
in line with all other rating calculations.
As an alternative Debitum Network provides an implementation of Community
trust arbitrage smart contract. Community leader may order implementation of
Community trust arbitrage smart contract from Debitum Network Trust Arbitrage
smart contract factory. Community is listed on Debitum Network portal if and only
if Community’s trust arbitrage smart contract passes audit.
If community will choose to construct their own implementation of Community trust
arbitrage smart contract they have to consider implementation of community trust
arbitrage smart contract standard (protocol).
Feedback management
All audited trusted communities will be listed on Debitum Network. If service
requestor (borrower or investor) will have feedback about provided services from
community member, community must ensure possibility to register feedback (both
positive and negative) and communicate with member, especially to solve negative
feedback.
https://debitum.network                                                                 19




Community and  community leader must  take  responsibility for ensuring  that
provided service from their members is appropriate and performed on decent level
of quality. Otherwise they must ensure the underperforming counterparty improves
or is removed from the community.
If service requestor (borrower or investor) won’t get any follow up actions from
particular  community,  it  will  be  possible  to  register  feedback  with  Debitum
Network Trust Arbitrage. It will investigate if community actions were sufficient.
If not, Debitum Network Trust Arbitrage may take a pre-designed action, i.e., use
counterparty’s frozen Debitum tokens to compensate feedback provider, manually
drop rating for the counterparty or its community, or even ban the counterparty or
its entire community from Debitum Network.
HYBRID connecting crypto and fiat
Importantly, as crypto is not recognized as a traditional currency in most countries
(except for Japan) and as most cryptocurrencies are too volatile, most business
borrowers and investors in short and medium term would prefer to deal with loan
principal and interest payments in its usual legacy way - using fiat payments.
Incorporating loan-related capital transfers might serve as a fancy façade for any
project, but the interest in such a system will remain chiefly an academic one for years
to come. By a premature move of onboarding loan-related capital today, we would
spook many potential users. Hence Debitum Network will use crypto currency only
for other financing cycle related fees and guarantee-like token freezes.
As for the loan-related capital, we look at it as “physical goods” that can be dealt
with off-the-blockchain with reference to it on the blockchain. The ecosystem has a
https://debitum.network                                                                    20




designated role - fiat facilitator - to take care of all fiat transactions, make necessary
records on the blockchain using smart contracts and ensure that the ecosystem can
be used from day one.
Hybrid approach allows us to combine current state of business practices and
blockchain infrastructure to have an operational ecosystem from day one. At the
same time it does not forbid to have a long term vision of crypto only transactions.
As time goes by and crypto currencies become more mainstream, Debitum Network
will be able to develop and evolve and transfer loan-related capital on blockchain.
Meanwhile, we will work hard to promote blockchain solutions to SMEs worldwide
at the same time addressing the credit gap issue small businesses are having.
Market making within Hybrid platform
As Debitum Network operates on the three-sided market. The problem of reaching
a critical mass of users on all sides (borrowers, investors and service providers) is
essential.
It will be possible for Debitum Network to use Debitum tokens from Reserve to
solve ‘empty room’ problem by lending Debitum tokens to various parties and
https://debitum.network                                                                      21




motivating them to try Debitum Network. Later, as they receive loans, interests or
payments - lent Debitum tokens will be returned to Reserve.
Debitum Network also aims to use ‘at the time not needed funds’ to conservatively
lend them to borrowers to stipulate more and more borrowers to join Debitum
Network. As there will be more investors in the ecosystem, these funds will be
returned to Debitum Network budget.
Lastly, we need to ensure compatibility and interoperability with other existing
finance  or  FinTech  solutions.  That  way  we  would  allow  existing  incumbent
companies to integrate to Debitum Network and become part of its ecosystem.
Debitum Network does not aim to ‘replace’ everything that has been built - we
must disturb the current way of doing business but at the same time allow existing
companies and businesses in the alternative finance sector to connect and move
from their existing solutions to Debitum Network.
TRUST based
By  combining  fiat  operations  and  highly  trustable  and  efficient  blockchain
based financing process Debitum Network will ensure high interest from SMEs
and investors. As lending is primarily driven by trust in the borrower’s ability to
repay, Debitum Network will ensure that all transactions will interconnect with
trust arbitrage smart contract that will provide objective trust rating for each
single counterparty as well as communities of counterparties (i.e., risk assessors
community in a single country).
To ensure the objectivity Debitum Network’s trust arbitrage smart contract will be
based on hard blockchain-based facts like services’ smart contracts engaged in, loan
principal amount worked with and other. Each ‘positive’ experience (like successful
execution of a service smart contract) will add some trust rating points, while each
https://debitum.network                                                                22




‘negative’ experience (like failure to provide service in prior agreed period of time)
will deduct some trust rating points. This will allow investors to clearly see the
trust level of involved counterparties in every single financing deal as well as will
motivate borrowers, service provider communities and individual counterparties to
act responsibly.
Such approach measuring each counterparty’s trust level will allow for informed
decision making by:
Investors will clearly see the trust level of the potential borrower and will be
able to make trust vs. interest rate decision.
Anyone will clearly see the trust level of any other counterparty that offers
services and will be able to make trust vs. price of a service decision.
Communities to see how their individual members behave, allowing to make
organizational decisions based on trust points earned or lost ability to have
such objective and trust based information for deciding on distribution of
available capital for financing SMEs and lending is a currently non-existing
opportunity for global investors. Hence Debitum Network creates a new
market, a new asset class that will satisfy global investors demand, attract their
available capital and solve worldwide credit gap challenge for SMEs.
https://debitum.network                                                                  23




Business cycle of the financing process
It is important to notice that Debitum Network recognizes the need for more than
two main parties (borrower and lender) to exist to make a successful investment
transaction.  The  team  behind  Debitum  Network  does  not  bluntly  believe  in
‘theoretical’  twofold  peer-to-peer  approach  connecting  just  investors  with
borrowers. All other stages of the financing process must be done by someone - in
the case of many of the current alternative marketplaces or P2P networks, usually
those stages are done by loan brokers / operators or by P2P operator itself.
To allow greater exposure and better access to financing for SMEs, the complete
financing process must be decentralized. To do that one must understand that a
financing process is based on a set of specific stages, i.e., potential customer must
indicate the need for finance, financial asset used as a collateral for the loan must
be verified to ensure authenticity, risk of the potential loan must be evaluated,
funds must be provided, later on (debt) collection process should be activated.
Additional services like insurance of the loan provided or secondary market for
sale/purchase of existing investments (loans already provided) may be provided
around the core business process.
Only if all steps are available, it is possible to ensure full end-to-end SMEs financing
process.  Currently,  this  end-to-end  process  is  locked  by  traditional  finance
institutions or by alternative financing companies. Unfortunately, it means that
investors must put all their trust and funds in single interconnected hands of a
particular company and its employees from various departments.
https://debitum.network                                                                    24




Debitum Network allows potential investors to transparently weight investment
opportunities and directly invest in SMEs  (opportunity traditionally locked by
centralized finance sector). Such ecosystem works as an incentive layer on top of
smart contract framework, which can provide the logical infrastructure for the data
and payment exchange. Transparency and additional trust it builds allows currently
localized or regionalized alternative finance industry to become truly global, in
addition, eliminating two levels of ‘centralization’:
A middleman in a form of traditional financial institutions or centralized
alternative finance companies or platformsю
Opening and decentralizing individual stages of traditionally locked financing
process.
https://debitum.network                                                               25




Stages of the financing process
A financing process for a specific asset can take various forms, but the stages of any
full end-to-end financing process are the same:

Detailed steps of financing process
Detailed financing process indicating actions of various members of the ecosystem
as well as automatic Debitum Network actions based on smart contracts:
Note: DN means
Debitum Network
https://debitum.network                                                             30




Description of Debitum Network financing process:
1A New Borrower: New SME applies using their business credentials to join
Debitum Network and must undergo initial pre-qualification process, i.e.,
prove that it is a legal company, provide some generic company data. SME is
automatically check against Trust arbitrage smart contract to make sure that
if SME was ‘removed’ earlier from Debitum Network, it would not be able to
return before the reconciliation period ends.
SMEs can join Debitum Network directly or via a broker / agent who deals with
SME non-crypto way while moving the needed loan onto Debitum Network.
Moreover, to further stipulate self sustainability of the ecosystem, referral
system compensating anyone attracting a new borrower with Debitum tokens
will be in place.
Borrower is registered on Debitum Network, a new account for crypto currency
is created (unless an existing one is used during the onboarding process).
1.1 Prequalify: If Borrower passes automatic prequalification (i.e., amount of
revenue, time from registration), the financing process advances; otherwise
Borrower can’t join Debitum Network and can try doing it later.
1B New application: Borrower can apply for a new loan (indicating needed
amount, acceptable interest rate, advanced interest rate in case of minimal
late payment, repayment date and other critical data) and provide information
on assets to be used as a collateral for the loan, if any. Initial validation of
application will be taken care - to automatically refuse applications that would
not make any business sense for the ecosystem thus not wasting members’
time as well as not to fill the ecosystem with ‘garbage’ applications.
https://debitum.network                                                            31




All data is recorded on the blockchain. New smart contract for particular asset
is automatically created. Borrower shall have Debitum tokens before applying
for the loan as Borrower pays Debitum tokens for asset creation within the
ecosystem.
2A Verify asset: Borrower (or Investor) requests verification counterparty to
verify the asset and authenticate it to description provided using traditional
measures, i.e., phone call to company, checking signed copies of documents,
or automatic process, i.e., automated process linked to local databases or other
blockchain solutions.
New smart contract for verification of the asset is automatically created.
Borrower (or Investor) may request more than one verifier to perform this step,
then all individual verifications as well as aggregated verification is presented.
Results of verification are recorded to blockchain. The initiator of this step
(Borrower or Investor) shall compensate counterparty for performing this step
in Debitum tokens - considering trust rating vs. price of verification. Amount
of 10% from all received fees by the verification counterparty is frozen to
guarantee quality of future services delivered.
2.1 Verified: If asset is verified, the financing process advances; otherwise the
fact about ‘unverified asset’ is passed to trust arbitrage smart contract and
the financing process is terminated, the loan request (based on the asset) is
removed from Debitum Network.
2B Assess Risk: Borrower (or Investor) requests risk assessor counterparty to
assess the risk of the asset (loan). Risk assessment is a complicated process that
is influenced by data available for different geographic locations and involves
various facets of potential risk like SME, its financial data, its customers,
liquidity of assets provided, market they operate, location they operate etc.
https://debitum.network                                                              32




Counterparty can do risk assessment manually by analyzing data or by using
automated risk scoring algorithms.
New smart contract for risk assessment is automatically created. Borrower
(or Investor) may request more than one risk assessor to perform this step,
then all individual assessments as well as aggregated assessment is presented.
Results of risk assessment are recorded to blockchain. The initiator of this
step (Borrower or Investor) shall compensate counterparty for performing this
step in Debitum tokens - considering trust rating vs. price of risk assessment.
Amount of 10% from all received fees by the risk assessment counterparty is
frozen to guarantee quality of future services delivered.
3A Insurance: The loan may be insured to decrease risk for Investors against
default of borrower and guarantee partial or full repayment of the loan.
Hence ensuring better traction of financing. It is a step performed by insurer
counterparty on the request of Borrower or Investor.
New smart contract for insurer is automatically created. Borrower (or Investor)
may request more than one insurer to perform this step. Fact of insurance
is recorded to blockchain. The initiator of this step (Borrower or Investor)
shall compensate counterparty for performing this step in Debitum tokens -
considering trust rating vs. price of insurance and proposed terms of insurance.
Amount of 10% from all received fees by the insurance counterparty is frozen
to guarantee quality of future services delivered.
4A Invest in a loan: Investors use list of available loans / dashboard of available
loans on Debitum Network to check, pick and invest in one or many loans at
the same time. Investors will be able to request more services to have better
information about the asset or based on the available information make an
informed decision in which loan to invest. Manual and automatic investment
options will be available - automatic option allocates designated investor’s
https://debitum.network                                                               33




funds based on predefined criteria, for example, risk rating, amount of loan,
geographic location, market operated in etc.
Investors will use existing borrower’s asset smart contract to record investment.
To have an automatic investment Debitum Network will scan and analyze
existing borrowers asset smart contracts and automatically invest in the loans
corresponding to automatic investment options set by particular investor.
Fact of investment is recorded to blockchain. Investor needs to have Debitum
tokens before investing in a loan as Investor should pay Debitum tokens for
investment creation within the ecosystem.
4B Fiat investment: As Debitum Network is a hybrid solution, all loan-related
payments (principal and interest) will be dealt in fiat currencies and treated
as “physical financial goods”. There will be a specific counterparty to ensure
fiat transactions - a fiat facilitator. Investors will make fiat transfers to fiat
facilitators who will make needed transfers to Borrowers based on investor’s
investment indications on Debitum Network. As Borrowers need to receive
a single fiat wire for the deal, many investors’ payments in fiat need to be
aggregated beforehand by fiat facilitator.
Fiat facilitators will use existing borrower’s asset smart contract to record fiat
payments sent. Fact of fiat transfer is recorded to blockchain. Fiat facilitators
keep a small percentage of fiat payments made as a compensation for their
services of distributing fiat from investors to borrowers and vice versa.
5 Secondary market: As soon as investors have invested in a loan, a new
tokenized asset class, a sub-investment instrument, is created. Such crypto
assets can be sold to other investors directly on Debitum Network’s secondary
market. Secondary market ensures that other investors will be able to purchase
“late assets with discount” or current investors will be able to liquidate their
existing investment with or without discount. Investor may list investments
https://debitum.network                                                              34




in loans that investor wants to resell and indicate discount offered to new
investors. Other investors may choose to buy the existing investment.
If one investor buys an existing investment from another investor on Debitum
Network secondary market, investment smart contract is changed that ensures
the repaid principal and interest is transferred to the new investor. Results of
secondary market transactions are recorded to blockchain. Current investor
needs to have Debitum tokens before publishing an existing investment on a
secondary market as current investor should pay Debitum tokens for creation
of a secondary market item within the ecosystem.
6.1 Loan paid on time: If Borrower repays loan with interest on time by making
a fiat payment to fiat facilitator, process is continued by fiat facilitator.
If Borrower does not repay loan with interest on time (including advanced
interest period, if such was anticipated), debt collection process is started.
6A  Fiat  repayment:  When  Borrower  repays  principal  and  interest,  fiat
facilitator assigns received fiat to investors as well as exchange agreed part
of interest received to Debitum tokens and transfer to investors’ accounts on
Debitum Network. This allows investors to keep continuously using services
on the ecosystem. Fiat facilitators repay fiat to investors only if requested by
an investor. Fiat is not repaid every time as holding it allows fiat facilitator to
optimize for fiat transfer costs, to distribute operated fiat over various regions
and countries. It is important as SMEs joining Debitum Network should use
local (the cheapest) fiat transfers available.
Fiat facilitators will use existing borrower’s asset smart contract to record fiat
payments received. Fact of fiat transfer is recorded to blockchain.
https://debitum.network                                                               35




6B Debt collection: If Borrower does not repay loan with interest on time
(including advanced interest period if such was anticipated) a new smart contract
for debt collection is automatically created and debt collection counterparties
may make proposals. Investors should vote on which proposal to take as they
may be extremely different, i.e., anything from regain small amount fast to
regain most of the amount very slowly. The period for votes closes either if
more than 50% of Investors picked a single debt collection option or time
dedicated for voting ends. The option most supported by Investors is picked
and that particular debt collector starts work for all existing Investors (not only
the ones that voted). When (part of) debt is collected, information is passed to
fiat facilitator to understand how fiat payment received should be distributed.
Fact of debt collection is recorded to blockchain. All debt collection costs are
taken from the borrower.
7A Trust arbitrage: When the process for particular loan ends  (either by
successful repayment of loan or buy debt collection process), automatic trust
arbitrage process is triggered for all members involved in the particular loan.
Each  smart  contract  used  throughout  financing  of  a  particular  loan  will
automatically trigger trust arbitrage smart contract for both parties involved.
Trust arbitrage smart contracts will be linked to main asset smart contract to
follow ‘the outcome’ of the loan. Based on specific objective criteria trust rating
will be updated (increased or decreased by certain amount of trust points) for
each party involved.
Service  counterparties  will  not  trigger  Debitum  Network  trust  arbitrage
directly but via community trust arbitrage smart contract to ensure that the
whole community represented by a particular counterparty gets their trust
rating updated.
https://debitum.network                                                               36




Trust rating can define availability, price, or priority for further actions within
Debitum Network bringing financing process to a new level by optimizing
financing process to promote the best performing members of the ecosystem.
Available trust ratings will be displayed on Debitum Network to allow other
members to consider trust before engaging into mutual business operation.
Data displayed may also include particular parts of trust rating, for example,
number of successful transactions, number of ‘thumbs up/down’, number of
disputes, and total transaction volume. With every successful transaction and
good final ranking, the increase in the system reputation will result in additional
Debitum token transfers across all involved members.
7.1 Action needed: Specific business rules will be developed within trust
arbitrage smart contract for automatic operations with Debitum Network
members based on changing trust ratings. To do that Debitum Network will
scan and analyze existing trust arbitrage smart contracts and performed
designated actions if trust arbitrage smart contract corresponds to automatic
actions designed.
7B Trust action: Based on changing trust ratings, specific business rules will
trigger trust arbitrage smart contract to perform certain actions. For example, if
trust rating of a counterparty drops by 50% its community shall decide of what
to do with particular counterparty, if no ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ action is taken -
the counterparty involved is automatically frozen for certain period or removed
altogether. Any automatic rule will be transparent and publicly available to
anyone. They are needed to ensure that only trustworthy counterparties are
participating within the ecosystem and to minimize fraudulence and potential
trust damage to the whole global ecosystem.
To recap, financing process within Debitum Network is designed in a way that it can
be used by direct counterparties for each financing stage, i.e., SME, investor, risk
https://debitum.network                                                                37




assessor etc., but it also allows proxy counterparties to use Debitum Network and
perform actual steps in non-crypto environment. For example, a loan originator can
register instead of a single SME and resell existing SME loans to investors, a sales
broker can register instead of investor and reinvest investors’ funds, any broker
may register instead of designated counterparty and resell needed services. Such
approach ensures better Debitum Network growth opportunities, ensures more
services to be traded for Debitum tokens on Debitum Network as well as allow new
businesses to be created and formed around Debitum Network.
Made for present, ready for the future
On the global level, most of the financing stages currently are carried out manually
-  meaning  that  they require  human  interaction  that  is  usually supported  by
technology or some sort of an IT solution. Currently there are fewer counterparties
that have fully automated the processes.
However, as time passes, it is believed that stages of financing process will become
fully automated, for example using artificial intelligence solutions, machine learning
algorithms and similar. To be ready for such development Debitum Network will
provide public APIs (protocols) for all smart contract types in the ecosystem. Hence
Debitum Network will be built to support current way of working as well as will
future automation - artificial intelligence solution will be able to use smart contract
API and integrate its actions with Debitum Network.
Such API based approach allows Debitum Network to grow in the long run:
it  allows  counterparties  to  integrate  AI,  machine  learning,  or  traditional
information systems to perform their services automatically, faster, more
efficient and with less errors.
https://debitum.network                                                                   38




it allows to integrate Debitum Network with other blockchain solutions, for
example, supply chain blockchain solutions that could automatically provide
Debitum Network ecosystem with trustworthy assets.
https://debitum.network                                                       39




Technical mechanics
Debitum Network requires strong architectural design and bullet proof technical
implementation to ensure successful launch and usability of Debitum Network.
The primary design goal of Debitum Network is to deliver the open system, which
could not only communicate with ecosystem powered by blockchain but also that
would be robust, easy to scale, and suitable for implementation for protocols needed
for Debitum Network ecosystem. Users must have possibility to communicate with
ecosystem not only through blockchain, but also by different system adapters using
them through computer desktop or browser.
Infrastructure
Debitum Network is a comprehensive middleware with its core running on Ethereum
blockchain and a number of gateways ready to incorporate counterparties who
run other standards of distributed applications. Since Debitum Network does not
incorporate its own consensus mechanism, its attack to sensitive data resistance and
fault tolerance are equal to those of Ethereum’s. For the same reason, Debitum has
no internal common mode failure problem. A fundamental limitation of blockchain
applications of being expensive is not relevant in Debitum Network’s case because
B2B transactions are relatively large. On average an SME loan is around 15 thousand
USD, hence currently known blockchain application related infrastructure costs are
relatively low.
For security purpose, system infrastructure will have public, easy available for
everyone, and private, controlled by system administrators, subnets. Adapters will
communicate with the ecosystem through load balancers in public subnet which
https://debitum.network                                                                40




main goal is to send data for ecosystem parts in private subnet. In private subnet,
EVM for communication with blockchains, would be deployed. Also, kubernetes
cluster where application, which will communicate with blockchain, and provide
data of smart contract status changes. All (which are not powered in Ethereum
blockchains) infrastructure will run in Amazon Web Service infrastructure.
Blockchain proves the existence of the content, both borrower-related and deal-
related. Hashed records are used for timestamps and current status of a deal. The
main system textile keeps metadata links to complete versions of documents stored
elsewhere, in other specialized blockchain-based systems. Some fair automation
will be applied, so long as it does not force contributors to change their normal
legal ways. Should the Ethereum ecosystem gain some legal acceptance, we will
incorporate the corresponding updates. Maximum indexing and labeling of data for
future use of big data and machine learning will be applied.
https://debitum.network                                                               41




System components
Use Cases
The following are the set of use cases that are architecturally significant to the
Debitum Network system:
User management                                                                       Debitum Network users will be able to securely
                                                                                      register in system and manage their profiles, for
                                                                                      providing data for all system participants in different
groups.
Asset management                                                                      Authenticated users will be able to operate with
assets as Borrowers, Investors, and Fiat Facilitators
Risk assessment                                                                       Authenticated users will be able to register in risk
management                                                                            assessment communities, provide risk assessment
                                                                                      services,  manage  community  as  managers.  Also,
                                                                                      investors, borrowers, Fiat Facilitators will be able to
                                                                                      order assets risk assessment and rate risk assessors.
Debt collection                                                                       Authenticated users will be able to register in debt
management                                                                            collection communities. Investors, Fiat Facilitators
will  be  able  to  order  debt  collection  from  debt
collection communities and rate provided services.
Each  use  case  will  be  separated  by  additional  domain  contexts  which  will
communicate between each other.
https://debitum.network                                                               42




Domain separation
Each use case will process in different domain context. Domains contexts will
be managed by additional services, which will communicate between each other
in orchestrated cluster. System design will have structure of the loosely coupled
services. Decomposing the system into the smaller autonomous parts will improve
modularity and makes easier to understand, develop, and test the all system.
https://debitum.network                                                             43




Frontend Components
Although Debitum Network system processes will be managed in Ethereum smart
contracts, users are not expected to interact with it through smart contracts
manually. For this purpose, they will be using front-end components that make
system functionality easy to use. Front-end components will be responsible to
manage (in the background) a sequence contract interactions on the ecosystem
network.
Backing Services
Not all system services will manage business domains contexts. System will consume
backing services as part of its natural operations. In Debitum Network system we
will have mainly three backing services:
Gateway service                                                                      Service   responsible   for   user   authentication/
authorization  management  and  protects  back-
end resources in the all application. Will manage if
resources can be exposed to front-end components.
A protected resource would only be accessible if user
will be authenticated. Unprotected resources could
be viewed by users who are not authenticated.
https://debitum.network                                                              44




Discovery service                                                                       Service  responsible  for  maintaining  a  registry  of
other  service  information  in  all  system  cluster.
Each service will subscribe in Discovery service at
the start-up. In subscribing service will provide its
networking  information.  By  doing  this,  all  other
services in the cluster environment will be able to
locate  other  services  by  downloading  a  service
registry and caching it locally. Discovery service will
be used as-needed to retrieve the network address
of other services that has dependency on needed
domain processes.
Config server                                                                           Service   responsible   for   centralizing   external
service                                                                                 configurations  needed  for  other  services.  This
service will allow other services to retrieve their
tailored configurations for the target environment.
Backing services are still considered as services, that solves a set of concerns that
are purely operational and security-related. All backing services will run in Docker
containers managed by Kubernetes orchestration.
Backend Services
Business logic of the Debitum Network system almost entirely managed by backend
services. Each of these services will be exposed as a seamless REST API which will
run in Docker containers and managed by Kubernetes orchestration. All business
domain processes will be managed by Debitum Network services:
https://debitum.network                                                                 45




Assets Service                                                                           Service responsible for managing processes related
                                                                                         with  assets  management  through  business  flow
                                                                                         between Borrowers, Investors, and Fiat Facilitators.
Risk assessment                                                                          Service  responsible  for managing  communication
management                                                                               processes between risk assessment inquirer and risk
service                                                                                  assessor communities.
Debt collection                                                                          Service  responsible  for managing  communication
service                                                                                  processes between debt collection requestors and
                                                                                         debt collection communities.
User management                                                                          Service responsible for managing user profile states
service                                                                                  changes in all system.
Smart Contracts
Rather than centralizing ownership of communities’ processes, interlinked Ethereum
smart contracts will give possibility to distribute ownership of processes flow
managed by various communities. Debitum Network smart contract standards will
facilitate a settlement flows between the service provider communities, investors,
fiat facilitators, and borrowers. To illustrate the intended functionality, we provide
workflow scheme which reflects communication flow on blockchain between
different ecosystem parties:
https://debitum.network                                                                  46

Community smart contracts
Processes flows of different system parties will be monitored and managed by
communities. To enable community participation in all Debitum Network ecosystem,
community  administrators,  must  implement  Debitum  Network  community
smart contract standard and register through trust arbitrage of smart contracts.
Community smart contact will have to implement “Community” standard interface:
https://debitum.network                                                            47




contract Community {
function approvedMember(address _member) constant returns
(bool);
function status(address _member) constant returns (string);
function register(string _fullname, string _email, string _data)
returns(bool);
function removeMember(address _member) returns (bool);
function approve(address _member) returns (bool);
function  ratingAddress(address                                              _member)  constant  returns
(address);
event MemberRegistered(address  _memberAddress,  string  _
fullname,    string _email, string _data);
event MemberRemoved(address _memberAddress);
event MemberApproved(address _memberAddress);
}
The description of the interface methods is provided below:
approvedMember - returns true if user is a member of particular community;
status - returns member status in community, which is managed by community
administrators, i.e., registered, active, blocked;
https://debitum.network                                                      48




register - registration method for new community member;
removeMember - method which can only be used by community administrators
to remove a member from community;
approve - method which can only be used by community administrators to
approve member registration in community;
ratingAddress  - returns address of rating smart contract for a particular
community member
Each community contract will be audited by trust arbitrage and if it passes it will be
registered in Debitum Network system.
Rating smart contracts
Each community will have to implement rating functionality for their members, to
provide objective member ratings for all members of the ecosystem. For users to
check information and ratings of different communities they will be able to check
it using communities smart contract by calling method ratingAddress. Community
administrators will have to implement rating factory implementation which will
construct rating smart contract for each community member. Rating smart contracts
will have to implement interface standard:
contract Rating {
function community() constant returns(address);
function member() constant returns(address);
https://debitum.network                                                                  49




function fullname() constant returns(string);
function data() constant returns(string);
function email() constant returns(string);
function rating() constant returns(uint);
}
The description of interface method is provided below:
cummunity - community to which user/member belongs;
member - member, which rating smart contract represents;
fullname - members full name;
data - additional data about community member;
email - community members email;
rating - members rating, provided by community.
Service request management contracts
Debitum Network system users will be able to request different services (as risk
assessment, debt collection, etc.), decide from which user to order service, to pay
for provided services, and to publish rating for delivered results.
https://debitum.network                                                               50




ServiceRequest smart contracts reflect agreements between service requestor
(borrower or investor) and counterparties (community members). When service
is provided / finalized for service requestor, particular smart contract sets status
of finished service and initiates trust arbitrage smart contract for counterparty
(community member) involved.
Each service request smart contract will have to implement interface standard:
contract ServiceRequest is ERC223Receiver {
function tokenFallback(address _sender, address _origin, uint
_value, bytes _data) returns (bool ok);
function proposePrice(uint _value) returns(bool);
function assetId() constant returns(string);
function deadline() constant returns(uint);
function serviceCommunity() constant returns(address);
function serviceProvider() constant returns(address);
function status() constant returns(string);
}
https://debitum.network                                                                51

Token economy
To understand if Debitum token is sufficiently likely to gain value over time after the
Crowdsale, it is important to apprehend token economy within Debitum Network
ecosystem.
Most important details are described in this section; however, please refer also to
Debitum Network Token Generation Event document, especially sections “Utility
of Tokens” and “Token Economy” for more details.
Debitum token (DEB)
The goal is to create fast growing, trusted, self-governed and global business
financing ecosystem, Debitum Network, that is built around its members and
employs single ecosystem’s cryptocurrency - Debitum token to pay for all the
services rendered. Only those having Debitum token will be able to purchase
various services via Debitum Network.
There are two intrinsic values for Debitum token to exist:
‘Value Exchange’ as Debitum token is the only means of payments within the
Debitum Network
‘Toll’ as all service providers should ‘freeze’ certain amount of Debitum tokens
to guarantee execution of future services via Trust Arbitrage mechanism
Below more detailed flow of Debitum tokens is depicted among various Debitum
Network members. As with any money-like instrument, the flow should be in an
https://debitum.network                                                                   53




equilibrium - number of all inflows equals to number of all outflows. However, the
time between inflow and outflow is the crucial factor directly impacting the scarcity
of the token and its increased value as demand shifts upwards.

Based on experience most investors, especially the largest ones or institutional ones,
are keen to stay in the ecosystem for a long term. Service providers seeing profitable
business opportunity will also stay in the ecosystem for a long term. Borrowers
are twofold: SMEs will stay for a short to medium term as they are expected to
grow stronger and become  ‘bankable’ and move to cheaper financing options;
while organizational borrowers (operators) should be keen to stay for a long term.
Thus we believe that as Debitum Network grows, more and more members will
join that will need to use Debitum token simultaneously, hence we should see the
demand in a point of time increase - increasing the value of the token. Moreover,
the members of the ecosystem and Debitum Network broader community noticing
the increase in the value of the token may opt to hold on to tokens rather than

selling them just after receiving via business transaction. As this would make supply
shift downwards, the value of the token should further increase.

Such design of token economy ensures Debitum token has intrinsic value. It
indicates that Debitum token may increase in value due to the following Debitum
token demand by:
https://debitum.network                                                                 55




borrowers and financial asset originators to pay for services rendered of other
counterparties within the process of receiving financing;
investors to pay for certain Debitum services, i.e., advance on debt collection,
additional insurance;
all ecosystem participants to use Debitum token for Trust arbitrage smart
contracts - where Debitum token directly allows individual counterparties and
communities to be rated. This provides additional social paradigm to Debitum
token and involves Debitum ecosystem members on a deeper level.
Debitum token traders to buy and later sell the token to capitalize on the
growth of crypto currency as the whole Debitum Network ecosystem growth.
Closed loop of aligned incentives
https://debitum.network                                                            56




Action plan
Using the experience of our team and the advisors on doing and building international
and finance operations, we have created the action plan to be followed to fully
develop and deploy Debitum Network. We can define several stages needed to
achieve our objective:
Stage 0 “Development”: during the initial stage, we will develop Debitum
Network 1.0 version and deploy it. This version will be fully functional to serve
initial markets.
Stage 1 “Preparation”: preparing market making and business development
operations for a specific region / country. Action may include hiring country
specific staff, preparing needed legal framework, adjusting procedures to
local / regional specific and similar. During Stage 1 operations in a country are
managed directly from the headquarters.
Stage                                                                                   2  “Market  entry”:  starting  actual  market  making  and  business
development activities within a specific region / country. During this stage,
initial counterparties  / communities are on-boarded in a specific region  /
country. At the end of stage 2 a country is managed via regional management.
Stage 3 “Market penetration”: market penetration happens during a period
of around  3 years for each country. After this period, there are enough
counterparties and communities as well as local borrowers that the daily
market making and business development operations are not needed and the
ecosystem is self-sustainable in that specific country. At the end of stage 3,
country operations are downsized, most of involvement happens from the
regional level.
https://debitum.network                                                                 57




Stage  4  “Self-sustainability”: With time the ecosystem will have enough
counterparties, communities, borrowers and investors to be self-sustainable.
No further business development activities will be needed.
Note: stage 0 and stage 4 are general stages for the whole ecosystem, while
stages 1 to 3 are specific for each region and country within that region, for
example, a country in Europe may go through stages 1 to 3 at a different
timeline and pace than a country in South America.

In the first two steps of Debitum Network geographical development we focus on
home markets we know best:
Step 1                                                                                               Step 2

Estonia                                                                          Greece              Poland           Romania
Hungary                                                                          Latvia              Czech Republic   Slovakia

After initial success in home markets, we plan to launch first markets outside Europe
within Step 3 in 2019Q4. We will focus on the markets with the largest credit gaps
for SMEs and the largest credit gaps per SME, in a good balance of these two
factors. In addition, we assessed each potential market for ease of doing business
as well as risks for launching and running business in each specific market.
For example, we chose to exclude significant potential
markets with estimated credit gap for SMEs above 25
billion USD but with a credit gap per SME below 3,000
USD, such as Nigeria, Indonesia and Vietnam. Average
credit gap per SME in the markets covered by the current
Debitum Network development plan is ca. 7,000 USD. In
European markets where Debitum Network is destined
to start, credit gap per SME is above 24,000 USD.
In addition, we excluded small markets with high credit gap per SME such as
Montenegro, Armenia or Belize for their limited market potential. Thus the list of
countries to be launched in upcoming steps are:

Use of Proceeds
The exact usage of fund received will be adjusted by the total amount of funds
received. The rule of thumb is that the more funds are received, the more countries
may be ‘launched’ within a shorter timeline. For Debitum Network (or any other
ecosystem, for that matter) to truly become a leading global player, one must move
as fast as possible. Why? Because competition increases, various local ‘copy-cats’
are created, momentum might not be reached and similar. It also means that most
of the funds shall be spent on market making and business development.

Business development
Each  country’s  development                                                              (i.e.,  country  business  development,  customer
relations, initial market making) takes around  1.42% of the budget and totals
to around 71%. Current calculations are made based on the hand picked list of
50 countries based on their total credit gap as indicated by the World Bank and
individual economic analysis carried out by the team. A community based approach
means that Debitum Network team should set up at least one community for each
type of service providers and help growing it. Moreover, if there is a potential for an
‘institutional borrower’ community - it will make it easier to attract more borrowers
/ SMEs via ‘institutional borrowers’ to ensure steady demand of loans. If there are
no such ‘institutional borrowers’, a particular country might require more direct
marketing and sales activities.
https://debitum.network                                                                   62




Managing the development and deployment of Debitum Network or ecosystem
management costs take around 11.3% of the total budget.
Each region’s development (i.e., coordination of activities within the region, bridging
the gap between global operations and country operations and similar) takes around
0,67% of the budget and totals to around 6.68%. Current calculations are based on
splitting all hand-picked 50 countries into ‘manageable’ regions based on market
sizes, geographic proximity and cultural similarities of the countries.
Ecosystem-wide business development (i.e., attracting global investors and ensuring
customer support) takes around 5.9% of the budget.
Debitum Network ecosystem technological development takes around 4.8%. We
will use a lower cost nearshore country for developing Debitum Network solution.
This budget allows to have an IT team of around 12 people that would develop initial
solution as well as ensure further development and country specific adaptations or
integrations, if needed.
Auditing of financial transactions as well as Debitum Network IT solution take
around 0.32% of the budget. We want to make sure that token holders are assured
that Debitum Network team spends funds in designated way and that the created
technological solution is secure and properly working. On top of paid auditing, we
are planning to use community testing and feedback to ensure the highest possible
quality to our deliverables.
As we have outlined the proportions for full scenario with 50 countries, initial use
of funds (after Stage 1) shall be different; however, in the longer period of time
proportions should reach the percentages indicated above.
https://debitum.network                                                                   63




Alternative development plans based on funds raised
In addition to the best scenario when the ‘hard cap’ is collected, we have developed
approach of how to act if less funds are raised. That approach is based on splitting
final market reach into four stages:
M A R K E T S  L A U N C H E D
1                                                                                      2                            3                         4
7 E U R O - Z O N E                                                                    + 9  C E E  &  B A L K A N   + 6  K E Y  M A R K E T   + 2 9  M A R K E T S
C O U N T R I E S                                                                      C O U N T R I E S            R E G I O N S             W O R L D V I D E
Debitum Network crowdsale is designed in stages. Reaching the ‘hard cap’ of initial
Stage 1 would allow to cover initial two steps of the business development plan.
Moreover, the short term excess of funds may be used to ensure better market
making and to fill ‘empty room’ problem from investors’ side. In such case funds
used for market making will decrease as more funds will be needed to cover costs
of business development in more and more regions and countries.
Self-sustainability
It is important for initial and later token holders to know that Debitum Network
can be self-sustainable in the long run and does not require additional funding to
run. Funding is needed to finalize the technology solution, set up operations and
expand in many markets around the world to truly create a global ecosystem.
https://debitum.network                                                                64

Potential business challenges
There are several potential business challenges that may alter the time needed for
a particular market to become self-sustainable:
Need for Education about Alternative Financing: it might be that a particular
market players, i.e., small businesses, have not heard of any other financing
opportunity than traditional bank financing. In that case it will take more time to
initially raise awareness of the whole alternative finance industry and services
available. Only after the initial awareness is raised, one may successfully start
offering alternative financing services to small businesses.
Crypto awareness: many business organizations do not have any experience
with crypto or tokens. Hence it might take time and extra effort to show how
such tokens are to be purchased / sold, how to use tokens and underlying
infrastructure, like wallet or exchange. To successfully implement Debitum
Network we should raise the general awareness of crypto and teach local
https://debitum.network                                                               65




organizations how to use it. At the same time we need to put more user
experience effort into the solution to make it easier understandable.

Debitum  Network  Solution
Summary
Project purpose
Facilitation of alternative financing forms through a distributed
cross-border platform for businesses and individuals.
The pain
The cost of provision of trust between lenders and borrowers is too high. Businesses
struggle for reasonably accessible financing due to the lack of effective international
marketplaces and transparent pledge security registries.
Pain killer
Decentralized, community and trust based ecosystem that connects borrowers,
investors and service providers in an efficient way. In long run design of Debitum
Network allows it to become self-sustainable. Debitum tokens will be used within
Debitum Network, while loan principal and interest payments will be transferred
using fiat.
https://debitum.network                                                                   67




Market timing
We will advance over the maximally wide frontline but will work in each place for
a certain period of time to ensure self-sustainability. A partial use of incumbent
practices allows the Debitum Network community to start making money right
away without strong dependence on the lagging broader adoption of crypto.
System
Debitum  Network  is  a  distributed  business-to-business  ecosystem.  The  core
technical  offering  is  Ethereum-based  application.  Debitum  Network  features
forthcoming APIs to enable middleware developers to easily link other networks to
Debitum Network.
Business model
There are many places for different actors to make money on the ecosystem,
communities’ leaders can earn from growing and looking after the community,
investors can earn interest on loans provided, SMEs can gain access to loans needed
for growth. Debitum Network will ensure trust arbitrage smart contract and will be
able to participate in the whole ecosystem.
https://debitum.network                                                               68




Competition
Debitum Network competes with pseudo peer-to-peer systems with centralized
management, with traditional vertically integrated institutions such as banks and
credit unions as well as with some blockchain based solutions. Most important
advantages of Debitum Network are lower costs and entry barriers. The main
drawback is the unusual nature of the framework which may limit the interest from
businesses at the initial stage.
https://debitum.network                                                             69




Future Prospects
Today’s industry  “whales” represent an existential threat to themselves. They
monopolize entire sectors and raise prices until the people have to fight back
in antitrust courts. They concentrate so much sensitive data in one place that if
something goes really wrong the size of the problem will be way beyond the scope of
any single company. And it feels more like ‘when’ than ‘if’. They abuse crowdsourcing
by seizing the sharing economy trend, creating an illusion of “democratization” but
in reality, restricting access, dictating rules, lowering margins for everybody else,
and generating the endless stream of all sorts of conflicts. The latest development
is that they are attempting to build permissioned distributed ledgers. That’s a cargo
cult and a serious security trap. Those systems, raised in sterile environments,
are going to be very vulnerable in the environment where hackers are trained on
constantly attacking open platforms which keep developing their immune systems
being open to the wild. Big corporations are trying to build an “intranet” again,
but this time, when they fail, the wild versions of things are soon going to be fully
functionable to entice their clientele.
An extreme centralization of things that we see today is temporary and nothing new.
History develops in an upward spiral where governance centralization fluctuates
between periods of weakness and strength. As a result, many tech stacks have a
sandwich structure—there are layers created in periods of relative decentralization
or chaos and layers created in periods of relative centralization or autocracy.
More new rounds of both centralization and decentralization are ahead. And it is
evident whose turn it is now. Decentralization is a vague term meaning anything
from “not all the processing of the transactions is done in the same place” to “not
one single entity has control over all the processing”. In case of Debitum Network,
from the very beginning, we will have ‘architectural’ decentralization (many physical
computers hosting the system) and ‘political’ decentralization (many individuals or
organizations ultimately control the computers that the system is made up of).
Once enough counterparties across many regions join the system, it will achieve
https://debitum.network                                                                 70




the final stage of decentralization, a ‘logical’ one—the interface and data structures
will become an amorphous swarm.
At later stages, the crypto innovation and decentralization might be accompanied
by shifts in the entire fabrics of economics. Economics is essentially how people
respond to incentives. Some big changes may take place in the not-so-distant future,
so people’s motivations will substantially mutate. The dominant business model for
physical goods may follow the software business fashion and play the ‘subscription
shuffle’ game so more people will not own products so much anymore, in a traditional
sense, but will “subscribe” to stuff and maybe even own the manufacturing in a
collective way. Unlike in software, in hardware it might actually make a lot of sense.
For example, Philips is setting up a business model where they sell light, not lamps.
A person pays for light, like an annual fee. The same is broadly discussed about cars
when they are self-driving. The same would also be good for shoes, jeans and many
other commodity-like things. Thus, consumers get quality products with constant
upgrades and can precisely plan their expenses; businesses cut costs and invest
in strategic improvements, not into a pointless new model rush; society can rely
on vertically integrated responsible actors to channel energy, waste, and other
pressure on the environment. In line with the above “saving economy”, a potential
switch from inflationary monetary model to deflationary one may become another
reason for economics to change. Now people are eager to spend dollars but prefer
to hold bitcoins. While we know for sure that the inflationary model of consumerism
can generate economic growth, albeit with constant threat of crises, in case of an
economy with dominant bitcoin-like money, we don’t know whether people will be
that motivated to set alarm clocks and go to work much.
Why does Debitum Network has better than average chances to survive such
[political] tectonics? First of all, it can adapt to a needed size and seamlessly migrate
its focus to more lucrative regions where there’s more demand. Secondly, it can
comparatively easily incorporate cryptocurrencies to carry principal capital and
new types of collateral including those new smart-contract-based types. And most
importantly, Debitum Network will accumulate efforts invested into it over time
https://debitum.network                                                                     71




in the form of structural improvements of distributed software not as tangible and
intangible assets exposed to political risk. Should a major crisis occur, it can always
wait it out in a temporary hibernation mode.
