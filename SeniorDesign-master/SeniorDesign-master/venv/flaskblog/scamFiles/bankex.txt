The Smart White Paper, version 0.3.1 beta
October 19, 2017
Abstract
BANKEX Proof-of-Asset protocol (PoA) is a standard that enables new generation of assets and contracts
called Decentralized capital markets. We are building Internet of Assets (IoA) on the principles of Bank-as-
a-Service (BaaS ), powered by Internet of Things (IoT ) and Artificial Intelligence (AI ) technologies.  PoA
protocol is open for 3rd party fintech providers, AI and IOT labs, traditional financial institutions and asset
owners.

A   Terminology
Blockchain     a cryptographically secured database containing the history of all transactions performed on
the platform. It works the following way:
1.  Transaction info is sent into the blockchain network
2.  This transaction together with other transactions forms a block.  Every block has its number and
holds encrypted information about preceding blocks.
3.  The block is sent in to be checked by all members of the network
4.  If there are no discrepancies, every member adds the new block to the chain of previous blocks and
the transaction is executed.
Node     a blockchain network participant storing information on past transactions (blockchain), checks infor-
mation on new transactions for authenticity and is able to add in new transactions (adding blocks).  All
the nodes are connected to one another forming a single network.
A public blockchain  is a decentralized system where the information on transactions is stored and checked
in many multiple locations.  This kind of synchronization between millions of locations consumes large
amounts of electric energy and is significantly more expensive than a private blockchain. The system also
becomes slower. However, a public blockchain may prove preferable for industries where decentralization
is necessary.
A private blockchain  is centralized, making it similar to traditional centralized systems, however it exceeds
them in terms of efficiency and security.
ICO (Initial Coin Offering)     a method of invitation to finance a campaign/project.   Tokens/coins are
issued that grant the right to receive a share/service/good now or in the future, or else they grant a
percentage of future profits.  After the start of sales, tokens can be resold to other investors.  Trade is
conducted on a blockchain.
Cryptocurrency     digital money without a physical analogue.   It is supported by the complexity of its
development     mining.  Today we are able to identify “classics” such as Bitcoin or Litecoin, and newer
currencies such as Ether, which act as platforms for the creation of new assets - tokens.
Ethereum     the most popular platform for issuing of tokens and smart contracts.
Gas     a unit used to measure the price of calculations done on Ethereum.  More difficult calculations are
rewarded with higher amounts of Gas.  This works the following way:  the originator of a smart contract
sets a price in gas. Miners, whose PCs handle the calculations, make the choice whether or not to perform
these calculations. If the price offered is too low, then neither the calculations, nor, as a result, the contract
will ever be concluded.
Smart-contract  a set of pre-programmed tasks that the program automatically carries out upon certain con-
ditions being fulfilled, then forms a deal. That’s why it requires no trust between sides, nor a middleman:
the contract has a strict logical structure and the computer executes it automatically.  Smart-contracts
allow for inclusion of a large number of conditions and states and for a correlation between their every
possible combination and various outcomes.
Ditigal tokens     croptygraphic assets issued using specialized blockchain platforms.  An analogue would be
a record in a register.  A token has an address and may also contain a smart-contract that defines its
function and also acts as a separate execution mechanism.
Tokenization     the process of transforming rights into a digital token, which is then traded on a blockchain
with low transactional costs. Tokenization is an analogue of securitization on a blockchain.
Smart Asset     an asset that has gone through tokenization using the BANKEX Proof-of-Asset Protocol.
ISAO (Initial Smart Asset Offering)    a method of fixing businesses (farms, stores, manufacturing plants)
using tokenization of their assets based on the BANKEX PoA protocol.

Product instance     an iteration of a fintech-product owned by a BANKEX product provider. For instance a
product provider can customize his product for various regions, thus creating a product instance for each
country.
Blockchain-agnostic protocol     an application level protocol that does not depend on the exact blockchain-
technology utilized and can be implemented on any existing open source blockchain.
