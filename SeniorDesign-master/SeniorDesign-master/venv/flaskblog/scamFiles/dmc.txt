1. Abstract
DarcMatter is the first truly decentralized global platform for the alternative fund investment industry. DarcMatter already
has a global presence with usage from over 24 different countries. Given the global reach and usage of DM, the team is
eager to create platform solutions that encompass cutting edge technology. While there has been much development,
many  tasks  in  the  alternative  fund  space  are  still  considered  manual  and  require  the  participation  of  numerous
intermediaries and service providers to provide the compliance, security and transparency necessary for investors to
connect with non-public alternative fund opportunities.
The blockchain and the capabilities of the distributed ledger have the capability of bringing transparency and security
into an industry that has been ripe with fraud and opacity since its inception. Additionally, changing and evolving
regulations to provide additional security for investors, has only increased the cost load on alternative asset managers,
which  makes  the  industry  more  incentivized  to  increase  the  assets  under  management,  rather  than  focusing  on
enhancing investment returns.
The distributed ledger that DarcMatter is developing has the ability to transform a multi-trillion-dollar industry from an era
defined by paperwork, opacity and information asymmetry, into one that will be characterized by transparency, security
and trust in a way that has never been seen before.
Additionally,  blockchain implementation  into the alternative  fund industry  will have  much broader implications  and
capabilities including but not limited to:
•    Seamless cross border investment capabilities
•    Documentation tracking for multi-consensus and logging
•    Additional asset classes being seamlessly distributed through the entire investor vertical
The DarcMatter team has operated the platform for 3+ years and is already working with 150+ funds (GPs) and 1,300+
institutions and investors worldwide (LPs).

2. DarcMatter Coin (DMC) Highlights
History is written by the victors.
Winston Churchill
2.1 Global Top Platform
DarcMatter is an already fully operational global platform, that allows investors all around the world to access the
alternative fund asset class in a transparent and secure fashion. Highlights for DarcMatter include:
•    Global Accolades: Awarded as Top FinTech platform from over 4 countries
•    Worldwide Investor Reach: 1300 investors (institutional, advisors and individuals) use utilize the platform to
source new investment opportunities
•    Expansive Global Access:150+ Funds on the platform with over $10 billion in total AUM
•    Global-Minded Team: Award winning team and top-caliber investors and advisors
2.2 Ability to Scale to Additional Functions
Alternative funds, while massive, represent just one of the industries in which the technology can be applied. Much of
the industry constituents are focused on P2P type payment / financial transactions or (on the other end of the spectrum)
enterprise solutions between institutions, like banks. DarcMatter’s platform and its technology has the ability to link these
two components. We believe that the traditional investment banking model is broken (to which alternative funds is just
one component) and ease of access from the individual retail investor to the most attractive (and previously inaccessible)
financial opportunities is perfectly capable and feasible.
2.3 Transparency and Security
DMC (DarcMatter Coin) will use systems that run natively on the NEM blockchain and will also benefit from many of its
important characteristics, including the proof-of-importance. Many other cryptocurrencies do not require that a ‘miner’ or
the capability to verify such transactions, to be a constituent to the community. Others only rely upon the stake that the
user might have. The Proof of Importance (PoI) allows for a natural synergy of both.
2.4 Critical Phase of Industry Changes
The alternative fund industry has been notoriously slow to change which was driven by both the culture of the industry
as well as the regulatory burdens. However, the industry has reached a critical inflection point where the need for the
market incumbents to access each other securely and seamlessly is becoming very critical. Large cases of fraud,
impropriety, frictions around global access and a growing investor pool, have all played a massive part in these changes.
The industry is now ready to embrace technological reform as a solution to much of the issues that plague the industry.

3. Industry Overview
“They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.”
Andy Warhol
3.1 Background
While traditionally there is much negative focus around the alternative fund industry, comprising of hedge funds, private
equity funds and venture capital funds, the reality is that alternative funds are becoming one of the most important asset
classes in the world.
Alternative investment assets are loosely defined as anything that does not fall into the traditional buckets of cash, equity
or bonds. As such this term is used to encompass exotic assets such as luxury goods, art, wine etc. Of these, the most
widely used and sought after since its inception have been the alternative fund asset class. 1
Historically, there has been a heavy concentration of investments into this asset class by institutional investors and only
the most wealthy of investors. This was caused both by the innate underlying cultural overtone of this asset class, as well
as heavy regulatory restrictions which required these funds to be intensely private, in exchange for looser regulations.
However, with the increasing amount of data that is becoming available on a real-time basis the traditional paradigms of
portfolio building are no longer sufficient and the inclusion of alternative funds is becoming critical for all investors. This
1 Alternative Investments 2020 - World Economic Forum

is still plagued by the difficulty in access, transparency and cost which makes it extraordinarily difficult for fund managers
and investors to connect in a seamless, cost-efficient and transparent manner.
3.2 Key Problems with the Industry
The alternative fund industry and alternative investments in general have historically faced much criticism and
challenges due to its opacity, difficulty in access and overarching costs of compliance that has been increasing over
time. As it has matured into an asset class for all investors, these problems have come to bear and has brought the
industry to the precipice of necessary change.
3.2.1   Lack of Transparency
Alternative funds have a notorious lack of transparency in its history. This has been traditionally driven by the state of
regulations as well as the underlying tone of the industry.  At the time of inception, alternative funds such as hedge funds,
private equity funds and venture capital funds, were reserved for the most sophisticated, well endowed institutions, and
the wealthiest of all investors. Industry opacity created massive issues such as the Long-Term Capital Management
collapse and the Madoff Ponzi Fraud Scheme. Billions, if not trillions of dollars, have been lost in this opacity, with no
efforts to create an industry wide schema to protect privacy and confidentiality as necessary, while being able to analyze
the overarching industry from a macro perspective to risk mitigate and make informed decisions.
3.2.2   Complex and Evolving Global Regulations
The state of financial regulations is constantly influx with global regulations evolving at an increasingly accelerated pace
in order to keep up with requirements for investors protections and a breakneck pace in the proliferation of the new
financial products. However, these complex and evolving global regulations currently hold all things constant for the
method by which investors and new financial products interact. Massive reform needs to occur for investors and fund
managers to have entirely new methodologies to interact through the blockchain, which DMC will accomplish.
3.2.3   Completely Offline Interactions
Currently nearly 100 percent of all interactions between investors and fund managers are conducted offline and through
physical  paperwork.  All  paperwork  is  often  customized  to  meet  specific  requirements,  which  may or  may not  be
necessary.  The offline nature of these interactions creates much room for error as well as leads to the increased opacity
as mentioned within Section 3.2.1.
3.3 Future Growth
Over the last three decades, the alternative industry has matured to become an integral part of the financial system and
the global economy.2 While this could also be driven by various macro factors, much of the changes also arise from the
increase in access to information and real-time data as well as the explosion in the number of nodes created in financial
services through the advent of technological change. By 2020, global wealth is estimated to reach US$220 trillion from
$150 trillion today. In conjunction with this explosion in global wealth, the necessity and inclusion of alternative assets
for investor portfolios will also continue to grow. As the importance of alternative funds continues to grow, the need for
further  transparency,  security  and  compliance  will  also  increase,  which  can  be  effectively  provided  through  the
blockchain and DMC.

6. DarcMatter Coin (DMC)
"The value of an idea lies in the using of it."
Thomas Edison
6.1 Introduction and Use Cases
The DMC will be utilized to unlock and to consummate the smart contracts for the investment completion in the DM
Decentralized Infrastructure. By tokenizing an antiquated system, DMC will create huge efficiencies and scalability for
the industry.

6.2 Why NEM Blockchain?
NEM has a very strong team of developers and a great vision which was driven around the development of the underlying
technology and its efficient use rather than marketing and hype generation as with many other blockchain platforms.
There was a focus on real-world use cases and the generation of the underlying value from the real-build out of platforms
and economics.
Furthermore, there has been significant  work  that  has been put  into  making the NEM  blockchain accessible  and
modifiable in a much more scalable fashion than others including Ethereum. And while the technology is very well
designed for platform building for secure transactions such as alternative investments, it also utilizes significantly less
power in its harvesting process as opposed to high energy use from mining of other cryptocurrencies.

6.3 Permissioned Blockchain
There are various types of cryptocurrencies in existence, with the primary differentiator  being the public or private
blockchain. DMC will be used for a permissioned blockchain, which is one specific type of private blockchain. While
having all the benefits of a blockchain, it also permits for the level of discretion and privacy that is often required for the
world of alternative funds and investments in general. The transactions are quick to verify for the DM platform as the
nodes for verification and harvesting are determined by the PoI vs. allowing for anyone in the general public to participate,
which would create security and privacy risks.
6.3.1 Photon5 Gateways
Photon Gateways allow for instant contract verification by Singularity Nodes (see below) that have the ability to harvest
DMC. Photon Gateways provide for a decentralized payment methodology for managers and investors to interact with
the Tachyon ISC™. This replaces the need for manual verification, paperwork and corresponding payments to travel
back and forth between various counterparties. LPs and GPs are able to interact in real time without the related costs in
a  completely  secure  and  transparent  manner.  Photon  Gateways  allow  for  fiat  or  cryptocurrency  denominated
investments and distributions to be made between fund managers and investors by generating DMnotes, which are used
to transfer the value of currency between parties and then burned upon usage.
For the investment and distribution process, fiat currency will be utilized to purchase DMC and then exchanged on the
Tachyon ISC™ for DMnotes. The DMnotes are then exchanged in smart escrow to be released once the contractual
terms are confirmed and verified. There is no cap on the number of DMnotes, is non-exchangeable besides on the
platform and denominated at US$10 / DMnote. DMnotes are returned once investments are closed and funded and then
burned.
6.3.2 Singularity Nodes
In order to align the interests of the owners of the DMC and the participants utilizing the Tachyon ISC™, harvesting will
only be conducted by participants based on our own system of PoI.  Singularity Nodes are permitted users or nodes that
have at least  15,000 DMC and a necessary volume of transactions to harvest and verify specific transactions. The
definition may evolve as the velocity of interactions increases and the complexity of the underlying information increases
as well. Participants on the network will be incentivized to further participate the utilize the Tachyon ISC™ to become a
Singularity Node and have the ability to harvest and verify.
Singularity Nodes will be judged by their respective  ‘g-factor’8, which will be determined by a number of elements,
including contractual complexity mapping from strategy profiles to outcomes9, the Dotson algorithm, nodal linkage history
and other proprietary mechanisms. Dependent upon the number of parties and interactions, DarcMatter may have to
develop a higher tier node with higher requirements.
5 Wikipedia: A photon is a type of elementary particle, the quantum of the electromagnetic field including electromagnetic radiation such as light, and
the force carrier for the electromagnetic force (even when static via virtual particles). The photon has zero rest mass and always moves at the speed
of light within a vacuum.

6.3.3   DM Universe Ledger
The DM Universe Ledger all of the key information that is necessary for the alternative fund industry to operate. Each
fund manager will record this information on the DM Universe Ledger and allow for seamless instantaneous interactions
between fund managers and investors, which at times requires 3rd parties as well. The necessity for specific 3rd parties
are often required because the system of accounting and reporting is not yet normalized, but with continuous growth
reporting requirements are also expected to normalize. The figure below outlines the information concurrently stored
and transacted through the blockchain which is stored on the decentralized DM Universe Ledger.

6.4 Tachyon8 ISC™ 9
DarcMatter is designing, on top of its already operational global platform, an alternative fund marketplace transaction
tool powered by smart contracts and the distributed ledger driven by the blockchain. This will combine the necessary
implementation of fund administration, distribution, reporting and logistics, which are highly inefficient between fund
managers and investors today.
DarcMatter will utilize a blockchain based distributed ledger which allows all parties necessary for completion of an
alternative  fund  investment  (any distribution  intermediary,  fund  reporting  entity,  fund  manager  and/or  investor),  to
concurrently and seamlessly be able to view the current and historical transaction record in full.
This is called the Tachyon ISC™, allowing all parties involved from the consummation to the servicing and secondary
sale of an alternative fund investment, to be recorded on the blockchain and executed through smart contracts. This
provides for the seamless nature of the blockchain to create new efficiencies of distribution and drives down the cost of
compliance while enhancing the investor transparency experience (without increasing costs).
The Tachyon ISC™ will comprise three primary components which will work in conjunction with each other to create a
truly decentralized and secure environment for platform managers and investors (1) Photon Gateways; (2) DM Universe
Ledger; and (3) Singularity Nodes.
