EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
TMONEY will be first decentralized platform for people to meet, provide different services, coaching,
consultation or any other help, which is time or task based.
Unique per minute calculation system and Blockchain technology makes platform to be secure and transparent. We will ensure that these meetings between
users are mutually beneficiary, great quality and rewarded. All transactions between users will be documented in Smart contract-based payment gateway, which
will be recorded in Blockchain, which currently is most secure system and open to the world.
Our team consist of highly respected and recognized Latvian entrepreneurs, who came together. TMONEY CEO Oskars Dombrava has big experience in
telecommunications and internet marketing, but his passion for this project started in 2016, when he saw need for such service living in Miami, Florida. After
creating bulletproof business plan together with some of huge Venture capital company advisers, focus groups and IT experts, finally workflow, platform logic,
proof of concept was developed. Only thing what was missing was logical solution to make it secure and transparent same time and available worldwide. 2017
was the year, when it was growth of the Blokchain technology and instantly we knew it was missing piece.
By using Blockchain and Smart Contracts, we can guarantee our users security, worldwide reach and necessary transparency. Currently there is no other
application in the market, which allows people to provide any skill set on-demand and get rewarded for that. Our unique per minute and per task calculation
system will make sure users always know what the reward will be. Popular on-demand applications are niche orientated, example Uber is for rides, Airbnb is for
rentals; however there is no united decentralized solution. On-demand economy is growing and Uber estimated worth is around $90bn USD. Time has become
real value and our target is to disrupt current old 9-5 job systems and let people use their time to grow their wealth.
TMONEY platform work on internal currency- TXM token. TXM token will allow users not to depend on banks or any other financial institutions. TXM is based
on Ethereum protocol and will be used for all transactions in TMONEY platform. TXM token will be controlled by users, so there will not be any fee for holding
TXM token. By using our cryptocurrency, it will give people relevant flexibility to use tokens as they wish- pay for services of other users, hold or trade for other
crypto or fiat currencies. Since TXM is ERC20 token, then it will be very easy to convertible to any well-recognized crypto or fiat currency.
TMONEY platform launch is planned for 2019 in Florida, USA and later that year we expect to expand to other states in US. Our goal is to scale TMONEY reach
worldwide with local marketing teams in following years. We expect to become profitable by third year. Main revenue will come from platform fee per transaction,
which will be 10%, which is less than Uber or other on-demand economy platforms charge.
TMONEY Vision is to replace current and old job systems around the world, allow people to choose what they do with their time and increase productivity and
improve people daily life worldwide

applications are very niche oriented, which eliminates lot of people, who
can provide great service to other people, but don’t want to be dog walkers,

Our mission is to help people to convert their time into money by doing what they love and can do. Unlike many other Blockchain start-ups, our internal
currency- TXM will be used to calculate real people time, which will not lose its relevancy.
Our Vision for TMONEY is to replace current job systems
with decentralized ondemand service platform
worldwide, where great meetings happen

WHAT IS TWO WAY REVIEW SYSTEM?
TMONEY will use 5 star rating system to ensure, that users provide quality meetings and
are satisfied with the service.
Both parties- Meeting provider and Meeting requester will rate each other, so we know the
meeting was good experience for both users.
This system works great for major companies like Uber, AirBnB, who use two way review
system for concluded deals,
Bonus system will be implemented to motivate users to have 5 star rating.
Bad users will not be tolerated and they will be suspended or eliminated from our platform.
Our Service department will handle these cases.
Fraud or fake accounts will be deleted instantly without warning if they cannot represent
documents to prove their identity by request.
WHAT IS GOOD USER ATTRACTS GOOD USER SYSTEM?
Good-user attracts good-user referral system will be one of the kind. We will allow users
with Good star rating to invite other users as Meeting providers and both parties will receive
bonus.   Any other ondemand service company does not use this system currently, which
is why algorithm currently is confidential. We predict to have viral growth of our user base
by using this system.

populations are connected to internet.
   Blockchain is growing in popularity- each year there are new blockchain users and TMONEY platform will make it easier to convert any other fiat
currency in TXM tokens by using Coinbase API. We chose Coinbase, as it is very stable and well recognized Exchange Company.
   TXM will have considerable advantage over other ERC20 tokens, as most of them are not easily convertible to fiat currencies, which are used by most
population.
   TXM token will positively correlate with the number of transactions realized through the payment-processing platform.
For our premium users we will develop TXM Credit card, where users will be able to withdraw or pay using credit card. In those cases TXM will be converted to
fiat currency on backend.




WHY WE START IN FLORIDA?
Florida has growing population. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Florida’s population has now topped 20 million people. Prognosticators have been
predicting this would happen for years, the way they have been predicting the number of Florida tourists would someday top 100 million. Florida’s population

WHAT IS TXM TOKEN?
TXM digital token is a virtual currency, which is designed within the infrastructure of the TMONEY platform as internal currency.The Smart Contract chain for
each transaction will generate TXM token. Therefore, TXM are never 'made out of thin air' but are always backed by other currencies. TXM tokens are pre-
generated and in limited quantity. TXM tokens can be split in 18 decimal digits. Tokens transfer from one user to other, when meeting between two TMONEY
platform users happen. Meeting pequester pays Meeting provider for the time spent on meeting or task what meeting provider has done. Initially TXM coin
represents 1 minute of meeting. Staring price of meeting minute 0,00074 ETH. Meeting provider can ask up to 10 TXM tokens per minute. This is not hard
coded and can be changed, when platform attract high paid experts, who become Meeting providers. Additionally, TXM will never be in excessive surplus.
They are always backed not only by other currencies but also by user activities themselves.TXM tokens are not mined by any other companies or people.

GROWTH OF PLATFORM
HOW WE SUSTAIN GROWTH OF PLATFORM?
Unlike other platforms that charge a 13-25% commission fee from user, not to mention another 5% given to the payment system, funds on TMONEY are
transferred to users practically in their entirety in the form of cryptocurrency. The platform charges 10% from service providers. This fee is taken when the
meeting has successfully finished and approved from meeting provider and meeting requester. This fee is transferred to the TMONEY reserve fund (see Fund
section below).
Comparison of various commissions and rates to attract backers from all over the world (including bank account fees).
All other funds are immediately transferred to a service provider who decides where, how, and on what terms their taxes will be paid. Therefore, many service
providers of TMONEY pay only 10% fees in ETH as compared to a minimum of 13%-25% which they pay on other platforms and have possibility to provide
much bigger variety of services.
This commission goes to ensuring the maintenance and development of the platform, as well marketing and user acquisition activities. Professionals will
manage fund, only reliable and prospective companies will be hired for marketing, accounting, technical support or other activities, which will increase
TMONEY platform reliability, security and popularity. We predict high growth potential, which will increase the capitalization of TXM token and TMONEY
platform.
FUND
TMONEY charges a fee from successfully completed deal 10%, which will convert to ETH and transferred to Fund. After that ETH is transferred to Fund. 5% of
the fees go to ensuring the maintenance and development of the platform, and 5% of the tokens will automatically be sent to the reserve fund.
As the platform develops, more and more tokens will accumulate in the fund. Reserve fund will be used to increase marketing activities and user acquisition.
In the event of TMONEY platform user engagement and amount increases, the value of the reserve fund will increase many times, and will increase marketing
and reach.
In the future, we plan to register a non-profit foundation as a separate entity. This will be feasible when all necessary regulatory approvals are clarified,
primarily the SEC and MAS. After that, the fund will be officially registered as a separate legal entity (fund), and management will be decentralized and
transferred to the community, which annually elects its representatives - delegates. This fund will invest in philanthropy and educating people about benefits
of crypto currency and Blockchain technology.




We will be locking up 160 million TXM tokens (that is the TMONEY-owned
portion and 40% of the total amount of TXM tokens) for 2 months after the
ICO. Only Bounty tokens will be distributed.

CONCLUSION
TMONEY platform main goal is to decentralize system how people work with each other and replace current system. People will be able to offer their unique
skills and use their time as asset. We will accept all users, who are legal age and want to do legal activities. Our platforms initial currency will be TXM, which
be payment tool in our platform; all transactions will be documented in blockchain and transparent. Because the users collect cryptocurrency contributions,
they get a unique opportunity to choose a convenient residence for taxation.
We will have lowest fees on the market- 10% of transaction, so it will give us competitive advantage over other platforms. As well TMONEY will not be niche
limited and unlimited service gives us unique opportunity to disrupt traditional market.
Unlike 99% of ICO campaigns, we do not just create another cryptocurrency in an already crowded market. We are building a TMONEY platform, in which TXM
will be a tool and a method, and not only the basis of future profit.
We will accept all popular cryptocurrencies and fiat money, which users can convert to TXM coins via TMONEY Wallet. Different audiences will engage with
each other and do ondemand meetings that they could not even think of before. We have an excellent, competitive team that will cope with any difficulties and
will realize everything that is stated in the Whitepaper.
Not only does the TMONEY platform directly increase the value of TXM, but it also supports service providers to ensure that they get paid, giving them a liquid
currency in the form of TXM. TXM will be available in crypto exchanges too, but most exchanges we are planning through TMONEY platform.
We will make sure meetings between users are secure (encrypted), mutually beneficial (two-way review system, rating system), fast (GPS system) and
rewarded (payment system).
Backers who have TXM coins on their accounts will be able to exchange them for services on platform, hold them or exchange for any other crypto currency
or fiat money. We expect TXM token value to raise, as more users join TMONEY platform and provide services. We will focus heavily on marketing, that is why
our prediction is to expand to whole US in 2019.
We believe TMONEY platform will become new way how people spend their time and it will replace traditional job system and meeting system. Thanks to
blockchain technology all transactions will be transparent and controlled by TMONEY users, however transaction subject will be fully encrypted, and so users
can provide and are paid for any service they find of value in. TMONEY will disrupt whole economy and job ecosystem and you have possibility to be part of
that.
