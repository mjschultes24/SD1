Introduction
Bountyhunters is an automated influencer marketing platform and bounty
programs managing service. It’s built on the “action=reward” model, and it’s
based on blockchain technology. The platform aims to help start-ups, ICO
projects, and existing companies to increase awareness of its own brand in the
market and to increase the number of significant mentions in social networks
and specialized marketing, PR channels, and blogs.
One of the key objectives of the project is to increase a project’s efficiency by
reducing the time investment and financial cost and to facilitate interaction
between companies and active participants in the social networks (the hunter,
influencer, opinion leader) by automating all business processes associated with
the creation of marketing campaigns, its management, analysis as well as a
selection, involvement and targeting of active influencers, as well as organizing
the distribution of payments (in fiat currency, tokens, cryptocurrencies or
steaks) in accordance with the performed actions.
Our goal is to create a safe and transparent
environment in the influencer marketing arena.
This will benefit the company and the owners of
social media accounts, receiving the opportunity
to monetize their own subscription base and
millions of readers, receiving more interesting and
relevant content.
The platform is based on blockchain
technology and backed with a utility token.

The main benefits of the project
- Optimized marketing campaigns. This is an opportunity to make
campaigns more transparent from the standpoint of ROI, CPA. Moreover, it
reduces financial and time costs associated with product launch and future
management.
- Increased coverage of a target audience - It productes the ability, in the
shortest possible time, to attract a new audience and to present a brand to a
wide but targeted community.
- Increased ROI and conversion rates within the sales funnel.
- Saved time and resources because of the full automation of the processes
and automated tracking of activities and payments.
Currently, the project is at the MVP stage
(minimum viable product). It’s in the process of active testing and debugging.
We do not offer a prototype or idea. This is already
a working marketing ecosystem and tested
business model that generates profit.
After running the first iteration of the prototype before the launch of the beta
version (present time), the system significantly increased its influencers base,
expanded the number of social channels with automated activity tracking
and performed more than 10 large and successful ICO’s, including Blackmoon,
Chronobank, etc. The total amount of the distributed funds within the
performed campaigns is ...... million. The system automatically tracked more
than a million activities, and the profits made are ...... $.
The project already covered its own development
and workflow maintenance costs.
At the time of the Whitepaper writing, the platform conducted its own
rebranding, updated user interface design, increased influencers database, and
signed several long-term contracts for the maintenance of the campaigns. Over
the next year, we plan to increase own influencers base to tens of times, attract
to our system a minimum of 20% of planned (for 2018) major ICO projects with
a minimum capitalization of $10 million.

Preconditions for the platform
development
At the moment there is strong growth in consumption of digital content and a
significant increase in the proportion of advertising budgets allocated to digital
marketing and digital channels of communication with the target audience.
However, traditional mechanisms of running and managing advertising
campaigns and promoting brand awareness in the digital environment
are quite expensive. Their effectiveness from the perspective of ROI and
key conversions indicators (cost of customer acquisition - CAC - customer
acquisition cost; the cost of converting the visitor into buyer - COC - cost of
client, etc.) significantly decrease, which forces businesses to seek alternative
means and channels to attract and inform the audience about the product.
The problem also lies in the fact that more than 30% of users use ad blocking
services that reduce the effectiveness of contextual and display (banner)
advertising.
The idea of developing a platform had some precedent and was not accidental.
Primarily, it was provoked by the above-described difficulties and problems,
which were impossible to solve with the existing (at the time of development)
technical solutions.
Facing these difficulties, we set the goal to find a way to effectively promote
our own in-house projects. Numerous tests found the most effective marketing
channel, which included collaborating with opinion leaders and the pre-
targeted owners of the thematic accounts in social networks. Unfortunately,
we encountered a problem. There was not a single solution that would allow us
automatically conduct such a campaign.
Solutions offered on the market:
- were not aimed at pre-targeted audience, which includes the blockchain
industry and the crypto community.
- often offered non-transparent pricing. As a result, it was not possible to
assess the campaign’s effectiveness in terms of conversions, cost per action, etc.
- required considerable time for the organization of the relationship between
an advertiser and a content publisher
- offered limited tools of analysis and performance review both of the
campaign and of the funds invested.
- were risky from the viewpoint of payments and internal transactions.
- not offered the opportunity to quickly attract a large number of influencers
targeted with a specialized thematic content.
Our team set a goal to develop a system that could mitigate these difficulties,
and, in early 2017, they created a model, developed the system architecture, and
defined the main tasks of its workflow.

History and development stages
February 2016
Search and analysis of the existing solutions for the bounty campaign launch for
the in-house projects.
January 2017
We formed the Department of Internal Community Managers, The stack of
services for the bounty campaign management without possible automation
were selected.
March 2017
Presented the decision on the launch of our own technological base for
carrying out the bounty campaign, which included the engineering of business
processes, forming a model of the system, the model of the interaction between
contractors within the system, and securitization and allocation of funds
deposited.
Jun 2017
The development of parsers for data collection and formation of the slice
of the target audience and further identifying of potential influencers. By
developing our own parsers, we managed to collect a targeted database of
over 25,000 influencers, which were distributed by grades and the parameters
corresponding to the quality of each account, its content, and audience
coverage.
We establish integration with the social networks and channels for automated
data collection.
Jul 2017
Start of the web UI and working prototype of the service for internal clients of
the company.
Formed the Department on communicating with influencers - within six
months specialists of the Department built relationships with each influencer,
sent an invitation to the system, presented the benefits of using the service.
/ 10




Development of internal tools and run of the test campaigns. We addressed one
of the key challenges that faced our team: how to simplify accounting activities
of influencers when the number of activities per week can reach several
thousand. Developed unique scripts for each social network channel (Facebook,
Bitcointalk, Reddit, etc.), which allowed perform automated tracking of the
actions (tasks completed) of each user.
Aug 2017
Full-scale launch of the projects within the platform - Blackmoon, WishFinance,
SmsChain, Zangll, Acorn and modernization of the system (integration of
the rating module, dynamic budgeting, preparations for the transition of the
business model for PR and business direction).
Integrated primary metrics and carried out deep integration with Google
Analytics (integration between the platform and the client side) to account
conversion and perform the calculation of ROI for every action released. As a
result, there was a significant transformation of the platform model from a
simple service of managing bounty campaigns into a convenient tool, operating
on the CPA model and providing the marketer with comprehensive data on the
actual campaign and thus allowing optimization in real time.
Actual moment
The platform is formed as a separate business unit with the full-working staff.
There is a set of clear objectives and engineered business processes, as well
as launched advertising, affiliate and PR campaign to increase the number of
influencers and to attract new customers.
While testing the first iterations of the platform prototype, we came to the
conclusion that, for example, a startup launching an ICO is required not just a
tool to simply launch the bounty campaign, but a competent and systematic
establishing of meaningful contact with the target audience.
After gathering the market data and performing the analysis of numerous
ICO’s bounty campaigns, the specialists of our analytical department came to
the conclusion that most of the bounty campaigns were ineffective because,
despite the number of performed activities, - ROI and conversions of every
activity were not possible to calculate, and the total volume of funds spent (on
average 1-3% of the gathered funds during the ICO) formed a considerable sum,
which simply disappeared in «pockets» of owners of the aggregated accounts,
often not presenting the target audience with any real value.
< /p>
/ 11




As we noted above, it’s required to have a
systemic approach to launch influencer marketing
campaigns: our platform is initially built to
achieve such objectives:
Key purposes the platform
can be used for:
- increase awareness of the new brand - an opportunity to increase the
number of people visiting the company’s website, downloading documents,
leaving personal contacts, reading any content about the company, etc.
- involvement/engagement - increasing amount of valuable content which
generates an active action form the target audience representatives (share,
comment, repost); active involvement of the audience to affiliate and referral
tools.
- audience and customer base growth - ability to increase traffic,
audience engagement and convert it into quality leads.
- lead generation - built-in analytical tools for gathering and analyzing data
of each influencer activity allow to customize the campaign and target it at
influencers providing the highest quality of leads/clients.
- sales - increasing points of contact of a brand with a new audience can
multiply product sales.
- retaining existing customers and increasing loyalty through up-
to-date and actual informing of the target audience about the news, positive
events associated with the brand.
/ 12




Mission, vision, and objectives
of the project
- Transform marketing processes into a more transparent
(for all contractors) form thereby contributing to the development of the crypto
economy.
- Increase the effectiveness of marketing strategies to make
them the most predictable and measurable.
- Contribute to the growth of innovative startups and the
development of an international, innovative field.
- Tokenize and automate the industry of influencer
marketing, which will solve the key problems of the industry:
- time-consuming action to attract influencers
- the difficulty of accounting of performed actions/tasks of the influencers
- the complexity of evaluating the quality of tasks performed
- the complexity of performing transactions (in the case when more than
1,000 influencers participate in the campaign and the total volume of
actions/tasks performed is more than 100 000).
/ 13




Platform workflow scheme
After creation of the campaign from the side of the campaign host (in the case
of the correlation of the rating of an influencer/hunter and the options set by
the host on the participation of a certain type of influencers), an influencer
receives notification in a private dashboard on the launch of the new campaign.
In case of confirmation of participation in the campaign from the side of the
influencer and from the side of the host, the platform automatically creates
a smart contract and deposits the minimum amount of money (identified by
the host in the campaign details) for an escrow fund. After performing each
action (posting content, repost, etc.), the platform automatically monitors and
tracks all these actions and charges each influencer a steak or some sum of
money in accordance with the performed actions. After the campaign ends,
the automatic calculation and allocation of funds between the influencers is
performed.
/ 14




The business model of
the platform
The platform is developed in the form of the hybrid business model, functioning
as a SaaS solution (offering the subscription payment model) and the exchange
model (payment for a specific service or an activity).
The platform acts as an underwriter of the distribution of the allocated funds,
and it will guarantee automated tracking of performed activities and collecting
of metrics. The platform also helps solve complex issues in cooperation with the
influencers, leveling them due to the decentralized architecture. All parameters
of the campaign and its conditions are written in the smart contract, and all
activities are recorded in the blockchain. Each campaign operates an escrow
fund that guarantees the fulfillment of obligations from the side of the
influencer and from the side of the business.
Currently, the platform’s development team is actively working on the
implementation of analytical tools that enable tracking activities and a deep,
real-time efficiency analysis of every performed action. After launching the
beta version of the platform, we also plan to introduce the following payment
features:
CPM - cost per thousand impressions - payment for 1000 impressions of a
certain information block (news, video, post, etc.).
CPE - cost per engagement - payment for 1 active interaction (like/repost/
share/comment).
CPV - cost per 1 view (for youtube video).
/ 15




Influencer marketing
industry trends
Influencer marketing is an alternative form of brand promotion that aims to
increase coverage and conversion from the target audience. The social networks
and channels - such as Youtube, Reddit, etc. - help avoid the problem of ad
blocking since the advertisement becomes native as an embedded part of the
natural flow of information.
Influencer marketing is a form of marketing in which the focus is on the person
(influencer) who has an influence (within their own, often narrow audience). In
this case, an influencer can be described as someone having an influence on a
certain circle of people and their decision-making process. The influencer is the
opinion leader in his own niche. As a result, his information is perceived as more
authentic and genuine than direct advertising from any brand. Therefore, it
causes greater confidence in the product than traditional advertising.
Clarification: a measure of «influence» is not directly proportional to the
coverage (subscribers, readers). An influencer can be considered a user of the
social network with 100 readers if he produces focused, readable and good
quality content. In our paper, a similar segment of influencers is defined as
«micro-influencer.”
/ 16




Influencer marketing is in the early stages of development. It is one of the
most effective social strategies for businesses of almost any size. Selling goods
through «opinion of other person» - has always been one of the most effective
forms of product promotion and is now correlated with a 20% - 50% of all
purchasing decisions. It will continue to grow because there is an active trend
that’s increasing diversity of products on the market, increasing competition
in almost every segment of business, and the availability of «information and
advertising noise» that cause the audience to look for support of their purchase
decisions. This support comes from the opinions and information of people with
similar beliefs, values, and socio-demographic characteristics.
The strong growth in the number of digital products, the growth of
e-commerce, the growth of information flow, and the emergence of the «new
media» has forced companies to seek new ways to effectively communicate
with potential customers. Audiences are skeptical of traditional advertising,
so contextual, media advertising drives customer decisions regardless of the
provided information by the brand itself.
The changing marketing paradigm means that there is a positive and active
growth trend of the influencer marketing industry and its core tools as the
primary strategy for many companies.
Market analysis
In 2017, roughly 32% of professional marketers began using the influencer
marketing tools among their key marketing strategies. At the beginning of 2018,
63% of budgets are allocated to work with the social networks and owners of
thematic accounts. At the same time, about 36% of the companies spend less
than $5,000 on this strategy.
Over the next 12 months, nearly 85% of professionals in the field of marketing
around the world will launch at least one influencer marketing campaign.
In the U.S. monthly budgets on this strategy amount to more than $255 million.
It’s not a coincidence because the number of users (devices) having ad blocking
specialized applications has already reached 700 million as on the beginning of
2017. 1
In 2017, three social platforms were considered most popular: Facebook,
Youtube, and Twitter. However, local platforms and chat services are also
gaining significant popularity. Platforms like Wechat, Telegram, Snapchat, and
specialized content sharing services like Reddit, Golos, Steemit, and others are
gaining significant attention from users.

/ 17




What’s more, it’s notable that 74% of the audience gets information about new
products and services from social networking channels, and about 50% of the
audience decides to make a purchase based on the opinions of influencers
(blogger, friend, or colleague) who are published in the social networks.
This strategy attracts leads with higher quality, which further demonstrate the
higher conversions (LTV, COC, etc). According to Research by Tomoson, 51% of
marketers appreciate this channel as more effective from the point of view of
the quality of the attracted leads. A study by eMarketer found that the strategy
also demonstrates higher ROI (on average 6.85 for invested dollar) than other
channels attracting target audiences. Pay Per Click and targeted advertising,
where, because of an overabundance of advertisers, high cost per click does not
allow businesses to build an effective model of work with potential customers
since the performed purchases of a product / service does not cover the
expenses.
Statista found that the average marketing expenses in the social networks will
reach $17 billion by 2019.
What’s more, BI intelligence found that the native advertising segment will
grow by 30-40% by the end of 2018.

This data shows a positive conclusion about the potential demand and the need
to develop a system that operates in this market and solves its key problems.
We can also note the popularity ratings of the main communication channels:
Instagram - 91%
Facebook - 80%
Youtube - 73%
Pinterest - 33%
Snapchat - 32%
It is also possible to note the age dependence of the efficiency of social
channels. According to our intelligent system shown below, it’s obvious which
channel and which target audience slice will be more effective for a brand.
For example, 62% of the 18-24 year-old audience makes a positive purchasing
decision when taking into account the information flow from Youtube.
Among the most common criteria that are assessed before influencer
marketing campaign launch can be noted the following:
Quality, uniqueness, and authenticity of the content - 75%.
The size of the audience and the social impact index - 70%.
Audience engagement - 64%.
Influencer cost - 56%.
Ways the influencer marketing
can help the business
- The increase of the audience coverage - By building partnerships with
influencers, a brand also gets access to their subscription database, which is,
in the most cases, already pre-targeted based on interests and demographic
characteristics. This increases the size of its potential audience. As a result,
conversions and client base increase.
- The increase of confidence in the brand and its products - According to
numerous studies, buyers are trying to base their purchasing decisions on
reviews and opinions of similar audiences. Compared with previous years, this
figure increased by 70%. According to the econsultancy report, the reviews of
the product from third-party users are 12 times more effective than the product
description on the official website.
6 https://activate.bloglovin.com/docs/whitepaper/bloglovin_marketers_survey_report.pdf
/ 19




- Improvement of the SMO and SEO parameters -  Because of the constant
process of the complication of website estimation algorithms and filtering/
banning of purchased links, search engines take into account the natural
growth of backlinks weight and already non-anchored brand mentions
(without URLs) in the text. That increases the rank of a website in search engines
and also brings a natural increase in traffic.
Analysis of the competitive
environment
At the moment, we can note only one direct competitor and approximately 10
indirect competitors. We are taking into account the projects that are working
with the same target audience including the blockchain and crypto startups or
companies.
Indirect competitors with a similar target audience or who are using blockchain
technology for the development of advertising platforms or protocols:

Comparing the project with indirect competitors, marketing platforms,
freelance platforms, etc. it is possible to note a key difference of our platform
from the competition: full automation and the ability to attract to the
campaign hundreds of influencers over a short period of time. The key
difference is integrated calculations of CPA indicators, which means that the
owner of a startup can evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign with the
help of integrated metrics. In most cases, the bounty or influencer marketing
campaigns on the market are conducted “as is.” The main task, in this case, is
only the coverage and the number of influencers. The quality of performed
activities and their impact on improving website traffic and conversion is not
assessed.
Among the major indirect competitors (with the similar business models),
operating on the market, we can define:
- The classic ads marketplaces, content exchanges, native advertising platforms.
- Platforms for lead generation.
- Companies automating marketing processes.
The majority of these projects often focus on a single channel (i.e. exclusively
YouTube or Instagram). They often have a limited amount of influencers and
often are not fully automatized. One of the key problems of existing solutions
is the lack of targeting and the lack of an actual working base of influencers
related to the blockchain/crypto industry.

Target Audience
The target market of the platform - We are pursuing companies that are
developing decentralized solutions that are based on the blockchain
technology. In addition, we are seeking PR and marketing agencies that can
provide the services of our platform based on the affiliate scheme for private
customers of the crypto / blockchain / start-up related niche.
Indirect target audience - bounty hunters/influencers involved in the creation
of content, perform marketing/pr related activities in social networks for further
monetizing of social accounts.
After many years of experience launching the largest ICOs and several in-house
projects, including one of the first successful ICOs - Chronobank - we created a
unique solution, which significantly simplifies communication of a startup with
opinion leaders and allows increase the coverage and engagement of a target
audience in a short time.
The system is designed for maximum convenience especially for the
representatives of the blockchain industry.
However, the application of the platform is not restricted to the blockchain
industry. The system can be used by any company, both technological and of
the traditional sector, working with a similar target audience.
The volume of cryptocurrency and blockchain market
The total market size of blockchain technology grew by almost 300% in 2017.
This sector is becoming more regulated, and many jurisdictions are beginning
to officially support the existing tools offered by technology companies. The
recognition of bitcoin as a legal means of payment in Japan and Switzerland,
the launch of bitcoin futures in the United States, and wide adoption of the
blockchain technology fueled an interest in the industry and significantly
increased the number of investments made by the large institutional investors
in the blockchain startups. The biggest global brands including Microsoft,
Dell, Expedia, HSBC began working on the integration of solutions of existing
blockchain startups (IOTA, EOS, RIPPLE, etc.) in their own technological
ecosystems.
Market growth of the ICO industry, despite the natural and «healthy» regulation
from the market and government, continues demonstrating a positive trend. In
2017, ICOs raised $3.8 billion, and they already secured nearly $3 billion in 2018.
It has continued growth potential as the industry is still in its early stages of
development.
/ 22




Market analytics
- $1.7+ billion was invested in blockchain startups by major venture funds.
- Over the last year launched more than 280 new startups based on the
technology of decentralized ledgers.
- Capitalization of the crypto-currency market reached $170 billion and
continues to grow.
- Every day more than 30 ICO campaigns are being launched in English-
speaking countries and this number will grow (with the expected correction at
the end of 2018).
- The volume of the target audience (people who either invest in startups, either
use the software developed by the blockchain companies or use investment
instruments - stock exchanges, short/long investments, futures, etc.) increased
2-5 times for 2017 and continues to grow.
- The number of users of cryptocurrency wallets continues to grow and is
estimated at between 2.9 million to 5.8 million active users.
This leads to a conclusion about the necessity and feasibility of developing an
ecosystem that would help new companies and existing brands more quickly,
cheaply, and effectively build a valuable contact with a target audience.
After conducting the prototype testing and starting the beta testing of the
platform, we can say with certainty that the market already shows an interest
in such solutions, and its representatives are willing to invest in their own brand
promotion a significant amount of funds.
The interest in our solution is also fueled by the significant growth of marketing
budgets. At the beginning of 2016, the average budget for the preparation,
launching, and conducting of the ICO was about $70,000 (including marketing,
PR, attracting a pool of advisers, but excluding costs for the team, development
and testing of the prototype). However, by the end of 2017 budgets increased
by 3-4 times, reaching $200,000 only for promotion of the company in the
European region.
The increase in costs (especially in the case of international expansion) causes
startups to seek new and better ways to deliver their marketing messages to the
audience. Working on a startup from a marketing point of view includes dozens
of processes, many of which are not automated and are very time and money-
consuming.
If we consider that almost 90% of the start-ups launch bounty campaigns and
also the campaigns of the targeted native advertising or allocate the budget
for the purchasing of testimonials from the thought leaders and distribute the
average from 1-3% (of the total fees of the collected funds) for such activity, it is
quite a large financial flow that allows our platform even now reaching the zone
of the payback.
In this regard, it is possible to speculate a great market interest in the project.
/ 23




Problems Solved
Until developing our own in-house system for the management of the bounty
campaigns, we personally experienced many of the same problems that plague
the blockchain industry. These problems were disruptive enough that they
reduced the effectiveness of the bounty campaigns.
The financial and time costs for finding influencers:
Finding influencers usually takes a lot of time and requires the creation of
a separate pool of managers to contact the potential influencers, to search
for suitable social accounts, and to build communication with each social
representative. Therefore, companies must invest additional funds to increase
their staff.
The difficulty, and often the impossibility, of an adequate assessment of the
work performed by influencers:
Influencers make mistakes, are confused with the documents, don’t have a
uniform system of operating the received links or documents. That’s why they
often publish materials that don’t correspond to the timing of the overall PR/
Marketing strategy (outdated links or content), don’t have a clear marketing
component, don’t have sales and conversion efficiency, and don’t position
the brand properly being not relevant to the core brand message. The market
doesn’t have a solution for the problem of an influencer with an aggregated
account (botted subscribers, spam content).
/ 24




Theft of funds in the advertising industry:
Unfortunately, this is a common practice. In 2017, around $16 billion was spent
on advertising within the sites with aggregated content and aggregated traffic.
The problem of the environment:
For the brand launching an ad campaign, an important question is a visual and
textual context, within which users will communicate with an advertisement.
One of the key issues, especially for the automated advertising platforms, is
the inability to publish the advertising message in an adequate environment
relevant to the brand.
The lack of Analytics and Predictive Analytics for evaluating the effectiveness of
the selected channels:
It’s difficult to understand that the selected channels (e.g., Twitter) are really
effective from the standpoint of ROI, CPA.
The lack of standardized contracts between an advertiser and a contractor. A
lack of content licensing:
The industry lacks standards for regulating the relationship between an adviser
and a contractor. If an advertiser is faced with the necessity of launching a
campaign in several countries at the same time, and in the case of operating
a large number of contractors, he has to find consensus among multiple and
differing campaign strategies.
Large commission to launch advertising campaigns on existing platforms
According to a study by Mediatel, more than 70% of advertising budgets are
spent on commission of the platforms and operating expenses (caused by
the presence of a sophisticated supply chain: advertising message > content
provider > publisher > data provider > contractor > web-site, etc. - each of which
charges a special commission). Auctions, bids (per click, per impression, per
location, etc.) existing on many platforms, are often opaque, highly dependent
on the environment (the presence of other brands and advertisers), and do not
allow conducting measurable and predictable (from the point of view of costs
and results) advertising strategy. It’s also worth noting the difficulties in signing
contracts with advertising platforms since signed agreements / contracts often
do not regulate key terms of the ad placement.
/ 25




Key Advantages
A) For a company, brand, startup
1. The infrastructure of the platform allows maximizing future profits by
increasing brand awareness through the coverage of a new audience. Moreover,
the platform helps by mitigating risks, conducting automatic tracking of
influencers activities with the ability to filter and target tasks only on quality
accounts.
2. The platform reduces operating costs. Traditionally the launch of the bounty
and influencer marketing campaigns is very costly in time and financial
resources. Working with our platform, there is no need to hire additional staff or
pay for expensive services of specialized agencies. Full automation of the system
allows for significantly reduce costs, both for an advertiser (bounty host) and for
the platform (allowing us charging smaller fees).
3. Automatic calculation of activities and results of the performed actions. The
representative of the company has no need to hire a separate staff of managers
to track activities and perform steaks / payments distribution, as the system
performs the automatic tracking of all actions, monitors key indicators (ROI,
CPA, see further, the «Analytics» section), automatically distributes the funds on
a pre-established plan of the budgeting and allocation.
4. The real-time data flow. No need to use Excel or other services for accounting
and management of the marketing campaign.
5. All-in-one - the maximum convenience for the manager - all existing social
networks and communication channels in the single manageable space -
Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, Reddit, etc. The platform provides an opportunity to
include additional (narrow-targeted channels), creating custom campaigns (for
specialized tasks).
6. The absence of the «stealing» steaks / funds problem. The platform allows
avoiding the common problem of spending funds on low-quality social
accounts   (aggregated or containing a large percentage of subscribers-bots),
and on tasks that don’t carry any value (for example, posts that contain
irrelevant or copied content, not unique content).
7. Deep verification of all influencers accounts and the presence of reputational
system - special algorithms (see the section “calculation formulas for ratings and
metrics”) provide a full transparency of a campaign for a business. The platform
carries out verification of each user account in a social network and analyses the
potential effectiveness of social activity of each influencer by parsing the data
provided by the API of the social network.
/ 26




Quality control - The platform gathers additional data that allows us to
determine the «quality/engagement» ranking of each influencer. For the bounty
host, it allows targeted tasks for influencers with the desired rating.
Deep learning algorithms are used to provide recommendations (after several
months of analysis of each influencer activity) regarding the selection of the
most efficient influencers depending on the task and the content type.
Accounts verification is held according to the following parameters:
- The account quality. The platform analyses the following parameters: age of
account, number of followers, the total number and size of posts, the average
reposts volume, the average number of likes and comments on a post, growth
of audience and audience retention rate).
- the quality of a site / blog including domain authority, domain age, amount of
content and its average size, the domain search engines rank, the dynamics of
the traffic growth, traffic quality (purchased / natural), and the social influence
of a content (shares, likes, reposts in social networks).
- the quality of a video account (on YouTube) including the age of the account,
the number of followers, the number of views, likes, reposts, and comments.
Furthermore, using these indicators, special formulas calculate the correlations,
and each influencer is awarded a multi-dimensional rating. The rating illustrates
the influencer’s activity and the quality of performed tasks. A higher overall
rating allows an influencer to obtain additional performance coefficients, which
enhances the ratio of each steak or task cost.
The system continuously analyzes the quality of each performed task by each
influencer, taking into consideration the above-mentioned indicators and
continuously correcting the ratings of all influencers.
8. High-quality and comprehensive database of the influencers who are not just
registered but are taking an active part in the development of the ecosystem
of the platform. The database has been tested on numerous projects and is
narrowly targeted and is aimed at the crypto / blockchain community that
allows achieving higher ROI and engagement rate within the target audience.
9. Intelligent selection of influencers - allows the platform to automatically
choose releva�� influencers based on the campaign objectives. This feature
is available thanks to the embedded analytical tools, data collection and
continuous analysis of the big data for all activities, the calculations of audience
engagement, etc. The brand can serve several purposes, depending on the
sampling of influencers.
a) increasing a brand recognition by increasing audience coverage
b) lead generation
c) upsell of the previously sold products
d) formation of the primary customer base for further «warm up»
d) leveling of negative news about the company
e) creation of positive information field about the brand
/ 27




Integrated systems for analysis and processing of data allow with the help
of the intelligent tips choose the most effective channels of influence and
content types. The platform uses «templating,” which helps to set the campaign
configuration based on available data by comparing previous estimates from
similar campaigns.
10. The speed of the campaign launch, as well as the speed of attracting
influencers to the project. One of the key problems of launching the bounty
campaigns is time needed for establishing contacts with potential influencers.
The platform allows reducing time costs to a minimum. The average time of
starting the project and inviting the required number of influencers takes from 1
to 5 days.
11. The absence of the «missing» activities. A common problem is when the
bounty manager either forgets to check the performed action or that action
is lost because it wasn’t marked by the influencer itself. The platform avoids
this situation by automatically tracking each action. In the case of «custom»
channels (e.g. translating content or creating a video), all activities that were
accepted by an influencer, are automatically flagged. And when they are
executed, the bounty manager receives a special notification. While these
labeled activities are not checked by the manager of the bounty program and
are not approved, the activity is ignored and the steaks are not charged.
12. The ability to target activity at certain influencers with specified parameters
and projected indicators, such as the number of views, coverage, number
of clicks, etc. Therefore, funds are not wasted while also developing a more
systematic marketing campaign that clearly meets the stated objectives and
allows more predictable results.
13. The transparency of costs - integrated analytical tools (ROI, CPA, CTR,
conversions, number of clicks, impressions, etc.) allows users to more accurately
meet the marketing objectives without budget lost. They can make decisions on
the fly by adjusting the strategy and optimizing its work. Analytical tools allow
building a measurable sales funnel, in which the key goal is not just to increase
«buzz» around the brand but to fuel monetization.
14. Global, international expansion - our influencers database is international
and helps reach an audience not only in European countries and the USA, but
also in Asia, Russia, India, Turkey, etc.
15. Easy to use - a separate support staff will help the bounty host arrange the
campaign and manage the created campaign from its launch until the stakes/
funds are distributed.
16. The increase in natural traffic volume (SEO, SMO). The actions performed by
the influencers, even of the non-popular social accounts, increases the quality
indicators of the web domain within the search engines like Google, Yandex,
and Yahoo. The search engines perform tracking of all mentions of a brand
and a domain. Currently, this occurs without any hashtag and anchor links,
and it increase the rating of a website. As a result, the company gets a higher
position on the key search queries and therefore gets the increase in natural
/ 28




traffic, which greatly reduces the cost of carrying out SEO and PPC campaigns.
The increase in mentions of a brand in social networks significantly improves
the «trust» of a website for search engines, which also eliminates the costs of
specialized SMO (Social Media Optimization) strategies.
17. Flexibility in configuring and selecting activities. At the moment, the
platform offers to manage the following activities:
Main activities:
- Sharing content
- Reposts on Twitter / Facebook
- Creating news, articles, post on Facebook, VK, Twitter, Bitcointalk
- Likes
- Activities in discussion groups, forums
- Work with subscribers in a telegram chat rooms and channels
- Tagging and hashtagging
- Writing blog posts or articles on owned or third-party sites, media.
Custom activities:
- Translation of content
- Writing specialized documents (white paper, reviews, analytical reviews, etc.).
- Subscription in newsletters, etc.
- Video recording
- Writing SEO / SMO content
- Lead generation
18. Convenient and well-designed interface. This allows users to deeply and
flexibly adjust the parameters of each campaign by using built-in filters.
19. Gamification models encourage more active involvement of the influencers.
The system has integrated badges, tips, and ratings that motivate users to
actively participate in the process and to create more high-quality content.
20. The lack of document flow and paperwork. Excessive tasks like the need to
fill numerous checklists and questionnaires, great slows the content creation
process. Our platform allows avoiding complex and long process of “briefing”
because the briefing model is built into the platform. It is a more convenient
and obvious format because it shows the predictive metrics of each step,
parameter, or condition.
21. The ability to view the activity history of each influencer and his interactions
with other advertisers.
22. Proof of Result (PoR) or activities verification algorithm. Often, the advertiser
has no way to evaluate the quality of the campaign. The metrics provided by
the contractors are often aggregated. For example, when the arbitrage model
is used, the purchase of cheap traffic creates the illusion of involvement. Our
system is built on the PoR algorithm. It builds real-time correlation of tens of
parameters, analyzes the analytical data, and compares it with the predicted
parameters.

b) Benefits of the platform for bounty
hunter / influencer
1. Verification of the companies. This alleviates a common industry problem:
non-payment of funds / steaks to a bounty hunter. Even responsible projects
might not collect, for example, a company might not receive the required
amount of funds during an ICO campaign, and they might have to cancel any
further business activity. In the end, hunters lose their time and money. To avoid
these issues, our platform uses verification of the companies by performing an
overall project audit, making an evaluation of the project team, assessing media
presence and the feedback from the audience, and a preliminary assessment of
a business model.
2. Automatic payouts after completion of the campaign or one of its stages: the
platform helps avoid a delay in payments. On our platform, the payout happens
automatically and immediately after the end of the campaign or one of its
stages. In the personal profile, every influencer can evaluate the result of his
own activities. A dashboard with key indicators of an account demonstrates the
actual amount of funds earned.
3. Escrow fund and escrow conditions
Every company that works with our system signs the escrow agreement with
each influencer This is done automatically through the integrated blockchain
functionality and issuance of smart contracts. Deposited funds will be paid to
influencers (for more details see “The tokenized model”).
4. Content monetization - the process of monetizing a personal social media
account is a laborious task because it takes time to find suitable advertisers. The
platform equips companies to monetize social activities as soon as possible and
to perform it on a regular basis.
5. Access to the platform even for beginner social account holders - Most of the
platforms and agencies in the market have high entry threshold for the owners
of social accounts. In our system, there is no limit on the age of the account or
the number of subscribers. Integrated tools for calculating ratings allow even
the novice bloggers to participate in the new campaigns. According to the
rating of each influencer, the system will adjust the payments ratios.
6. The opportunity to participate immediately in several bounty campaigns.
The platform does not limit a participation to only one ongoing campaign. On
the contrary, the system allows an influencer to take the decision to participate
immediately in several campaigns.
7. Access to a large number of bounty campaigns in the same space - Hunters
often have trouble locating advertisers to support and monetize their social
accounts. Our platform provides a marketplace for those advertisers (bounty
hosts) that are highly relevant to the content strategy of each influencer and the
characteristics of its core audience.
/ 30




8. The affiliate program and opportunities for further monetization - Any
contractor on the platform can participate in the referral program of our service,
which attracts new audiences A successful referral earns a percentage of the
performed activities as well as compensation for providing internal content /
activities audit services for the brand.
9. The absence of a security deposit - On many existing ad platforms, an
influencer is forced to save part of the earned funds in his own profile as a
guarantee of fulfilling the received orders. Usually, market platforms require a
minimum balance of 1-5% of the transaction amount of an order. The balance is
deposited to guarantee completion of a task. In our platform, this practice is not
used because it increases the complexity of the interaction with an advertiser.
This practice also increases the time for implementation of transactions within
the system, which is not stimulating the overall performance of the platform.
10. Additional monetization through participation in the scoring mechanism.
The platform gives any influencer the ability to receive additional bonuses
through participation in the verification (checking for compliance with the
terms of the order) of activities performed by other users.
C) Benefits to the industry as a whole
Because of the integrated tools for assessing the quality of influencer accounts
and every performed action, the influencers are forced to create more engaging
and interesting content (to increase the number of views and CTR), which
stimulates the industry as a whole and increases the quality of the information
field in this niche.
Technical features of the platform
Automatic activity tracking
Currently, the framework automatically parses and performs permanent action
tracking for every registered influencer. Automatic parsing is carried out in the
following channels:
- Facebook
- Vk
- Twitter
- Bitcointalk
- Reddit
- Instagram
/ 31




The system analyzes each post on several parameters including the number of
words in the post, the presence of a hashtag with a mention of the brand name,
the presence of specified keywords, links, and unique text. These parameters are
used in the formulas for the calculation of the total rating for each influencer.
If it’s impossible to carry out an automatic activity tracking, verification is done
manually by the bounty hunter.
Examples of such tasks:
- Translation of content
- Publication of articles / interviews / reviews on third-party media resources
- Registration for third-party resources, creating the subscription lists, etc.
For the convenience of task management and verification of actions, an
instant messenger will be integrated into the system that will allow direct
communication with each influencer. This is especially useful in the case of

custom tasks when a bounty manager has to communicate separately with
each influencer.
Influencer selection and filtering
Within the platform, there are several ways to select influencers:
1. Automatic invitation of all available influencers into the campaign.
2. Invitation of influencers selected by certain options (rating, communication
channel (YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc.), metrics (coverage, average number
of reposts for the post, etc.).
3. Manual invitation of influencers or creation of a closed bounty program,
which is accessible only to selected users.
The parameters of the selection and filtration
These parameters allow users to more flexibly and accurately define their
potential audience, which is likely to have similar interests.
- Themes. This includes broad subjects like «ico,» «investment,»
«cryptocurrency,» «trading,» etc. This setting is very important because it reflects
the relevance of the interests of an influencer and his audience to the main
thematic of the task.
- Communication channel. This is selected according to the main social channel
such as website, blog, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, forum, etc.
- Gender - male / female
- The age of the audience ... to. ..
- Coverage - the number of followers or subscribers.
- Geo-targeting - region, which includes more than 70% of followers of an
influencer.
- Language.
Ratings Calculation
To avoid participating in campaigns for influencers with aggregated accounts
(bot-subscribers, irrelevant, copied content, etc.), the system calculates the
rating of each influencer and his actions. Depending on the rank score, the
system adjusts the cost for each action (in case of using CPA model for the
campaign payout).
For the formation of rating indicators and key metrics (for each registered
account), the platform uses the following formula:
The formulas for calculating the engagement rates. These figures demonstrate
how the target audience reacts to the posts made by an influencer.
Facebook engagement rate:
Post engagement rate = (# of likes + comments + shares (per 1 exact day) / Total
of FANS (per 1 exact day)) * 100
/ 34




Twitter engagement rate:
Twitter engagement rate = ((# of replies + retweets) / Followers)* 100
Engagement rate for other channels:
(( Likes ×  X +  Comments × Y +  Shares × Z ) × 100%) / Fans
Automatic generation of the UTM marks for each influencer task
For more accurate tracking of the parameters (clicks, conversions, etc.), each
link provided by the bounty host is marked with UTM label with embedded
parameters generated separately for each influencer.
On the basis of Deep Learning instruments
We are currently testing the deployment of the neural network on the basis
of Tensor Flow API, and analytical tools of the Python environment - Pandas,
MatPolib, and others.
Example: When creating a new campaign, the platform will calculate the
potential coverage, an indicator of engagement and the expected CTR rate for
the overall campaign, which are based on the characteristics of the selected
influencers.
Predicting performance is possible because of the continuous collection
and analysis of data on every account of all registered influencers and the
use of averages over a certain period (at least six months) of these accounts,
integration of the corrective indices for the «weight» of each indicator. For
example, the average «weight» for the metric «likes» for a single account is
calculated as follows: the average number of likes for 1 post (with a certain
number of characters) for the year / number of followers for the half year
(excluding new followers increment).
Please stay tuned to the official website and our blog. We plan to publish a
series of articles related to the development of analytical tools on the platform.
We will also release case studies and descriptions of the development of the
internal processes of our system. We welcome your comments and advice.

The metrics provided by the platform
For more in-depth analysis and statistics of the used communication channels
and influencers, as well as updating the ratings of the users, the system collects,
analyzes and calculates the following indicators. Metric calculations are used as
internal resources. Analysis of the obtained data with the help of parsing tools
and social networks API requests) and third-party data providers (SproutSocial,
Klout), which provide application-specific data that meets the more narrow
objectives.
Organic Page Likes / Unlikes: the total number of natural likes / unlikes, obtained
by the post which wasn’t advertised using Adwords, Facebook Ads,  of unique
visitors of the page.
Post Reach / Impressions: the number of unique visitors of the account that saw
an informational message (content, post, video, etc.).
Engagement rate: the number of unique visitors who clicked a link, liked,
commented on or share / retweet the post or add the post to Favorites.
Link Clicks / CTR (click through rate): the number of users who clicked on the
links inside the post.
Replies / comments: the number of comments on a post or replies to tweets.
Content rate: the Number of units of content (posts, tweets) that an influencer is
producing for a certain period.

Influence score: a measure of impact - calculated as the ratio of the quality of
/ 36




the posts, engagement rate and the influx of new followers.
Cost Per Engagement: allows evaluating the cost of efficiency of an influencer
activity in real time.
Google Analytics
Integration
For tracking deeper marketing metrics, our platform has a built-in tool to
integrate a campaign with Google Analytics. Our company also offers a
specialized platform that offers a personalized presentation the Google
Analytics on the client side. The following indicators, as well as a more
customized calculation of the specialized micro-conversions, are available:
Average purchase value/average order value: the average value of each
purchase.
LTV: Lifetime Customer Value: the profit that a customer generates in a certain
period of time (six months, a year, etc.)
ARPU / Average revenue per customer: the average profitability per client.
Conversions: the number of email database registrations, documents
downloads, website registrations etc.
CPA (cost per acquisition or cost per action): the cost for the final action
committed by the client.
CAC (customer acquisition cost): the cost of attracting a potential customer to a
web-site.
COC (cost of a client): the cost of converting a visitor into a real customer.
RPC (revenue per click): the average profit for one click.
ROI (return on investment): return on investments spent on an advertising
campaign or bounty campaign.
Product sales: number of sales.
Bounce rate: the number of visitors who clicked the link, went to the site, but
immediately returned to the social network.
The platform provides several payment options:
- The allocated amount for a certain action/task.
- Steaks with the distribution of the allocated budget in fiat or cryptocurrency.
Distribution of funds occurs automatically after each reporting period (e.g., once
a week).
/ 37




- Steaks with the distribution of a specified pool of tokens of the future project.
The distribution of funds occurs after the end of an ICO after the automatic
calculation of steaks for each influencer. The platform integrates with the ICO
project server-side, creates a separate smart contract, and the distribution of
steaks happens automatically after the ICO end.
Campaign setup
Allows setting the following parameters:

Task Timing Setting
The setting of the start / end date of a publishing task. Timing allows for a more
systematic and flexible marketing and PR strategy. This feature was introduced
for the convenience of building systematic marketing campaigns. For example,
when certain activities outside the bounty program (scheduled interview
publishing or an event/conference), are supported inside the platform with a
specific type of tasks (publishing of post-release, press releases, reports - only in
a designated and regular time interval).
Two-factor authentication
Is used to protect accounts and payment information.

Centos 7, Ubuntu
- Secure transactions with blockchain and smart contracts - Docker-
containerization of services, a unique sandbox for each service, reliable identical
environment for each version of the product; the containers orchestration,
reliable and individual service deployment; Two protocols for communication
between services - TCP/HTTP, insulated data transfer within the overlay network,
JWT authentication between services during the connection period;
- The application is deployed in the cloud, with automatically scaling resources
depending on load rate, built-in protection against DDoS attacks; Development
of applications using agile (Scrum), multi-level testing versions (including
testing errors) during the development.
Microservice architecture:
The architectural style of microservices is an approach allowing developing
an application as a set of small services, each running in its own process and
communicating with others.
Connection security is provided by JWT-authorization (JSON Web Token /
JWT contains all the minimum necessary information for authentication and
authorization in an encrypted form). There is no need to save user data in
session because the token is self-contained.
Cloud storage
Storing data in a cloud repository on multiple distributed servers with the
ability to scale resources.
Protection from DDOS attacks
At the moment besides the in-house tools, developed especially for the
platform, it uses also the service provided by the Cloudflare.
Data structure and platform architecture
- Influencer register - contains information about the profiles of influencers,
their ratings and an information used for further targeting (geographic region,
age, gender, interests, content themes, etc.).
- Register of social accounts and websites - contains information about the
metrics and indicators of social accounts and platforms (blogs, websites) of
influencers (number of subscribers, visitors, virality, engagement, etc.)
- The register of companies - contains information about the hosts, their activity,
internal ratings.
- Financial register contains information about the current activity (the
orders) and deposited funds, performed and paid activities (orders), and other
procedural information (currency of a transaction, time of a transaction, etc.).
/ 39




- Orders register - contains information about performed and current orders
(tasks), including terms, parameters.
- Register of the referral program - contains information about the referral
activity, payout percentages.
The performance
For maximum performance, the project adheres to the following principles:
1. Storage of key processes in memory.
2. Storing key business logic in a separate thread.
3. The use of object-oriented information model.
4. Using separate databases for information flows related to different business
processes.
Taking into account these principles, the platform was developed as a
framework of separate interconnected modules. Each module has its own
version and can be modified individually without affecting the operation of
the system as a whole. This provides the flexibility to adjust and complement
the functionality of the system and to track bugs directly in the event that they
occur.
/ 40




Key system modules
The analytical module - analyzes the information obtained during data-parsing.
The module consists of multiple internal models, each of which performs
certain calculations - of conversions, rankings, predictive parameters.
Data parsing module for the social accounts and activities - provides data
parsing from social accounts of influencers, as well as from third-party
platforms (websites, blogs).
A module for calculating influencer ratings - conducts a weekly calculation
of quality indicators of social accounts and performed activities and their
compliance with the objectives of the campaign.
Activities verification module - performs automatic verification of activities;
distributes activities for additional manual verification among influencers with
high ratings.
Transactional module - a trigger based module (works in case of fulfillment of
conditions prescribed in the smart contract) interacts with a smart contract,
ensures the payment and conversion of funds.
Messaging module - provides instant communication within the system
between influencers and hosts.
/ 41




Tokenized
model
The tokenized model
Technologically, the project represents the hybrid model built as with the use
of traditional tools (relational databases, etc.), and blockchain technologies that
are integrated with each other to ensure ease of use, greater speed of internal
transactions and more secure data storage.
One of the key advantages of using blockchain technology in the framework of
the project are:
- Ease of conducting financial transactions within the platform.
- The lack of the need for signing additional regulatory documentation for each
contractor. In  particular, the interaction of different contractors from different
geographical regions with different legal and legislative framework).
- Reduction commissions on currencies conversion and transaction during the
payment process (particularly in the case of numerous microtransactions).
- Secure storage of digital assets (representing high value - data; funds, etc.).
- Ability to scale the system to millions of users.
However, taking into consideration the experience of developing our own
blockchain project and the experience of other industry representatives,
we are aware of the disadvantages and limitations of existing blockchain
solutions and protocols. For example, using the popular blockchain platform
Ethereum obviously limits the project in achieving high transaction volumes
because Ethereum can only provide up to 20 transactions per second.
Another significant problem is the implementation of micropayments.
/ 42




Currently, the average transaction cost within the Ethereum is about $5-10 for
a 10-minute transaction. For large payment volumes, this imposes significant
limitations on the overall speed of the system and increases costs. Most of
the projects of traditional (non-blockchain) industry which use mechanics of
microtransactions  also offer very high commission rates for the processing and
withdrawal of funds. For example, on popular freelance exchanges, the average
fee rate is about 30%. We understand that this might be a rational decision
when offering a real value to the client. For example, the ability to find the order
executive in the shortest period of time is a value-proposition. However, within
our platform, we aim to avoid this problem.
In this regard, we decided to use a multivariate framework, which uses
multiple protocols and tools. Realistically understanding of the complexity of
the simulation, launch, testing, and development entirely in-house solution /
protocol, we have decided to use tested and proven platforms and protocols,
demonstrating real effectiveness for high-load systems.
- Ethereum - to issue smart contracts.
- To ensure speed and scalability - all of the data that do not bear the critical
value is written in a traditional relational database. And then the key results
of the interaction of the information clusters among themselves (i.e. metric
calculations), is committed to Ethereum.
- Bitshares Graphene - using an open-source Protocol «Graphene» allows
significant scaling up the capabilities of the platform. Graphene allows the
algorithm to handle up to 100,000 (tps) transaction per second (for comparison,
the Bitcoin Protocol has tps about 7, while the cost of each transaction is 25$).
During the prototype development and testing of the Protocol, we encountered
a technical limitation, but there are simple solutions for this problem. The
Graphene Protocol validates a transaction on average for 1 second, but the
speed is directly proportional to the used resources of RAM. A slight decrease
in the speed of transactions can significantly reduce the resource-intensiveness
of the hardware side and does not affect the provision of value (convenience,
simplicity, the speed of use) to the contractors of our system. Because even
with the most optimistic scenario of the development of the platform the peak
number of transactions will not exceed 50,000 per day.
/ 43




Additional advantages of the Graphene protocol
- A reliable and flexible Consensus Protocol - DPoS - Delegated Proof of Stake.
- Dynamic allocation of rights to existing accounts - (Dynamic Account
Permissions) - enables to distribute access to accounts; increases the security
level of storing funds and data, which is especially important when working
with corporate clients.
- The referral program built into the Protocol allows increasing the motivation of
using the system, and motivation of token ownership to third-party users.
- Recurring & Scheduled Payments and the integration of flexible settings
and permissions for funds withdrawal. This is particularly important in the
framework of our platform, as payments distribution and withdrawal to
influencers is made at specified time intervals, or after achieving certain
conditions (indicators, metrics).
The platform token
HNTR Token                                                                           HNTR SP Token
/ 44




The value of the platform is represented by the HNTR token, local currency,
secured with the cryptographic algorithm and that can be used to purchase
the subscription to use the service, as well as for internal transactions. The HNTR
token functions as a utility token. The following table shows characteristics
(marked in bold) of the HNTR utility token :
Our platform’s utility token can be compared with the API key that is provided
to access the service and acts as an internal means of payment backed by
the smart contract, which is generated for each significant activity within the
platform (the launch of the campaign, funds distribution, etc.).
The purchase of the token during the ICO provides the opportunity to its
owner to use internal services and gain access to the entire infrastructure of
the platform. The token contains the transaction value. It may be transferred,
donated, sold to a third party, to a counterparty, and purchased on the relevant
exchanges. This transactional mechanism increases the potential market value
and liquidity of the token.
The token is issued on the basis of the Ethereum blockchain, and it is ERC-20
compatible.
The platform takes a commission from each completed contract. These fees
will be used to improve the operation value of the service and to update the
technical functionality and increase influencers database.
/ 45




Transactions safety
The Token is designed with the aim to increase the safety of internal transaction
between the counterparties (bounty hunters, influencers, and hosts) of the
platform. The smart contract, integrated with the token, allows configuring the
flexible parameters of each transaction (for example, if the host does not receive
the content of pre-defined quality (the posts don’t meet the stated metrics),
the smart contract algorithm will automatically either reduce the payout per
performed action or cancel the payment.
Our platform uses a 3-level approach (host < > influencer, as well as the system
itself) with a focus on its own verification system - Proof of Result (PoR). This
verification system calculates the efficiency of each performed action and
builds correlations (the compliance of action to the pre-defined conditions and
campaign objectives), uses the above-described estimation algorithms of the
influencers accounts, averaged metrics obtained from the performed actions
of other influencers and many other parameters. It provides a system with a
real opportunity to assess the work of an influencer and make the solution
(automatically) about the possibility of payoffs and the volume of additional
bonuses (in the case of increased performance) to each influencer.
The use of such mechanical verification process avoids the traditional problems
of the advertising / marketing industry. For example, it eliminates the expenses
for any fake actions that do not provide any value. It also helps avoid additional
costs by avoiding long advertising chains in which each step of the chain adds
extra costs. Our platform allows eliminating these expenses and “theft” of funds,
as well as to build the maximum transparent scheme of the campaign launch
with clear performance indicators and standards.
All data (campaign conditions, the conditions of achievement of predictive
indicators) of new orders are encoded in the smart contract and stored in a
decentralized ledger.
/ 46




Security of rights of the
licensed content
Let’s note also an important component of our project: the ability to tag license
content in a smart contract and to introduce certain conditions for its use.
Operating with licensing and potential content theft are incredibly prevalent
in the industry. The appearance of programmatic advertising platforms,
unfortunately, did not solve the problem, because such systems are composed
of numerous contractors (websites, data-providers, publishers, content
generators) that frequently complicate the work and can’t guarantee the proper
content ownership.
The platform’s smart contracts embed the licensing details on the created units
of content (content as provided by a brand and the content that is generated
by an influencer). The conditions of use of this type of content are configured.
For example, geographical restrictions or temporary limitations are included in
the smart contract. This is particularly important in the case of operating with
other geographical regions and taking into account local legislation. The system
automatically checks compliance of the license and its conditions to the actual
facts of performed publications. Integrated tools of linguistic analysis of the
content (with the help of Natural Language Processing units) allow the platform
to automatically decide whether the content is copied or modified, etc., and
then if necessary (if these parameters are set during the order creation), to
conduct a verification of performed activities and conditions of the license.
As a result, we can confidently say that our project contributes to the
transformation of the advertising industry in a more measurable and
transparent class.
/ 47




Escrow conditions
Escrow of allocated funds also allows securing the work of influencers,
guaranteeing payment from the side of the host. Our platform solves a major
problem of the industry:  dependence of an influencer on the persons who take
the final payment decisions. In our case, an influencer doesn’t interact directly
with the manager of a startup, but with the platform that deposits funds, thus
guaranteeing the safety and final payouts.
While creating a campaign, a host can choose the options of conducting a
campaign:
1. CPA - pay-for-performance - the platform calculates the cost of campaign
using the averaged metrics and indicators of influencers-participants and locks
/ deposits funds of the campaign host prior to the launch of performing of
activities and achievement of objectives).
- click (see ip filter / trim cheat) or give the host the opportunity to reject the
activities of the bounty hunter with a subsequent ban.
- YouTube (views)
- lead (api development)
- purchase (api development)
2. In the case of the traditional “bounty” campaign launch (with the distribution
of steaks from the specified overall amount, or a dedicated pool of tokens
of the project), to avoid problems with upcoming payments (in the case of
cancellation of the crowdsale), the host deposits 10% of the specified campaign
funds (according to the cost of buying 1 token during the ICO period) in liquid
currency / cryptocurrency (eth, btc), but not the tokens (as before they are
available on crypto-exchanges, they do not carry real financial value). Therefore,
even in case of cancellation of the ICO, influencers will receive funds for
completed activities.
Upon completion of the project, the platform releases the allocated funds and
process their distribution. Each transaction is recorded in a decentralized ledger
that guarantees the transparency of the funds’ movement within the ecosystem
of the platform.
/ 48




Commissions on the
transactions
Currently, high commissions inside the advertising industry are a real
problem. In the case of using multiple advertising systems by a startup, overall
commissions, in most cases, exceed the specified conversion parameters
needed to attract new customers and ensure the profitability of the company
and preserve the margin parameters of the product). Our platform takes only
10% of the total cost of the campaign or of each completed and verified activity.
Exchange module
The exchange module will be developed to simplify interaction with the
platform both of influencers and representatives of companies. It aims to:
- transfer of funds from personal accounts / wallets to the system itself
- transfer of funds within the system between users (tokens can be transferred
to another user, donated, paid as a personal bonus).
- the conversion of the token to other currency (for further withdrawal to the
popular wallets or exchanges).
Automation of activities
verification - meta-
moderation
The decentralized framework integrated into our platform also reduces time
spent on manual activity verification. To increase the motivation of using
the system from the part of the influencer, the platform offers an additional
monetization tool - the opportunity to participate in the evaluation of other
users activities.
For the brand, it brings the following benefits: no need to manually check all
activities (although this could be done at any time). For checking other users’
performed tasks - an influencer gets a bonus. The ability to check other users’
activities is available only to influencers with a high rating. In this case, we use
an analog of the PoW algorithm, increasing the quality of verification process
within the system and reducing the subjective factor (in the case when one
manager verifies all the activities). A single activity is offered for inspection for
few hunters simultaneously, and the general decision on the final verification
of this activity is taken by the system based on an average rate for other
completed checks.
/ 49




The token price
The value of the token at the time of the crowdsale will be 1 HNTR = 0.5$.
The final cost of the token as a market asset couldn’t be determined at the
moment because these indices are affected by many factors including supply
and demand for the token, trading volumes, news and media factors (news
about the development of our project), correlation factors related to the
development of the crypto industry as a whole and to the indicators of other
popular currencies.
Motivating Factors For
Token Possession
To ensure the development of the platform and to increase the interest of the
counterparties of the platform, additional motivators of token possession are
introduced:
- Possession of a number of tokens from BontyHunters enables an influencer
to obtain the status of a delegate and to participate within the Management
Board of the platform and to vote on the strategies and tactics of further
development of the system.

A list of possible risks
The risk associated with the effect of violated expectations: the complexity of
the development of the above-described functionality of the platform. Risk
category: low.
At the moment, 70% of the functionality of the platform is already developed,
60% is tested, the platform is in its operation state, having successfully
passed the stage of beta testing. And at the moment 70% of the developed
functionality fully covers the existing needs of our real customers.
Ethereum functionality violation and related to this risk the problem of not
issuing of tokens. Risk category: low.
Taking into account and performing a deep analysis of the experience of ICOs
of the major market projects that had problems with a) receiving payments
b) website overload, c) longer (compared with the planned) time of tokens
release, etc., we have developed our own failure-resistant platform (integrated
with Ethereum), which acts as an intermediary-service for accepting payments
in all popular currencies, and also allows to avoid problems with possible
failures of the website due to an instantaneous large flow of users. This platform
was successfully integrated into the ICO campaigns of many major projects:
Micromoney, Blackmoon, etc. You can get more information on the platform via
this link.
Risks associated with new legislative regulations. Risk category: medium.
Our decentralized project operates in a non-fully regulated legislative side of
the market. In this regard, there is a risk of introduction of certain restrictions
on the conducting of crowdsales, as well as on the class of digital assets, digital
products in some jurisdictions. The decisions taken within the legislative
frameworks of the target markets may affect on the workflow of our project
and may cause possible changes of dates of the crowdsale launch, or its
cancellation. In case of cancellation, all the raised funds will be returned to all
participants.
Active development of a competitive environment. Risk category: medium.
Our project operates on a fairly competitive, but not yet fully saturated market.
Among the possible risks, it is possible to note the emergence of similar projects
with a similar concept and business model, or the transformation of the
business models of existing major players (operating, at the moment primarily
as programmatic advertising platforms). These factors can increase the
payback time of the project, as well as a possible decline in the token market
value. However, these factors are taking into account by our team, and niche
uniqueness inherent in the platform, as well as unique functional elements, will
provide the platform a strategic perspective and will help to stand out from
competitors and to offer to the market a valuable and unique product.
