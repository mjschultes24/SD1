White Paper
2
 The market for cryptocurrencies is the most dynamic of
our time. We are convinced that the future of the current financial system will be dependent on the development of the blockchain technology and on the reaction of the community. The
blockchain can and will, in our view, be used to achieve a really
strong, positive development of the financial system. For quite
some time, our team has intensely worked on the blockchain
technology and cryptocurrencies. We discovered, that due to
its strong volatility and high anonymity, people do speculate
more with cryptocurrencies than using the coins as a currency.

Problem Statement
 Due to its strong volatility and
high anonymity, people do speculate more with cryptocurrencies
than using the coins as a currency.
Globalization
 Over the years we have implemented new services in our lives.
These have been improving and facilitating the creation of distinctive
ones with the same purpose. Just
a few years ago, society only had a
small amount of games that came
with our cell phones. Right now, we
have online stores with millions of
options and information in one click
away.
 Whether it is on online games, social network apps or browsing websites, we have seen the dramatic
increase of advertising or the need
for micro-transactions to access
more content. These have been an
increasing concern and it is affecting our online experience.
 The world will be a lot more globalized in the future and the digital
platform is a pioneer in every front,
including economically. TenXcoin
allows us to be more connected in
a globalized society, while simultaneously is giving us the opportunity
to expand our individual goals and
projects.

the new
decentralized
digital era!
 The power is on the people’s
hands. We are now on a revolutionary status. Globalization requires a more independent and
decentralized system - quicker
and easier transactions. Everyone
wants to be part of this extraordinary era and we all can contribute
to it. Therefore, TenXcoin is part of
the revolutionary wave of the 21st
century - part of the starter pack!
 Tenxcoin was created in association with ten companies, whose
goal is to participate in this emerging
economic system and help it grow
by adding a new cryptocurrency to
the market and by providing legitimacy on a business perspective.
 Tenxcoin prioritizes safety and
eco-friendly strategies.

Earnable
currency
Apps and DApps
DApps stands for Decentralised Applications. It consists in apps that
use a blockchain-like cryptographic technology which algorithm involves a decentralised mechanism
incorporated. These apps include
tokens which are needed for its usage. Building a digital economy inside our Apps and DApps users are
able to earn TXC simply by performing valuable actions.
Users Value
As TenXcoin expands its economy
to include cryptocurrency that holds
real value both inside and outside
of the applications, the economic
possibilities for users are vastly enhanced. This makes it possible to
transform attention, curation, and
creation into real-world value simply by having a smartphone.
Join Players everywhere and be part
of the first decentralized TenXcoin
ecosystem economy. Participate in
short surveys, try out new products,
watch videos, and help finish small
tasks to earn rewards in TXC Token.
It’s easy, it’s free, and it requires absolutely no mining.
7
Vision The soul of every blockchain project is the community, and
one of the greatest ways to serve the community is through
giving them a way to communicate and use the token. The
TenXcoin team will fund the creation of Apps DApps and
bots for various chat services which will enable people to
share their TXC easily with the rest of the world. Through facilitating this free flow of TXC, we can enhance utility while
also engaging and growing the community.
8
Vision
Ecosystem
 As a company, TenXcoin has been
searching for a sustainable monetization model that does not compromise user experience or privacy.
Rather than opt for mass display advertising or the selling of consumer
data, TenXcoin has decided to adopt
a decentralized organizational model. Its goal is to encourage the development of a digital services ecosystem that is fair and open.
To foster an ecosystem that is not
only open and decentralized but also
more compelling than its traditional
counterpart, TenXcoin must create
a series of new products, services,
and systems.
A new cryptocurrency
 Building a decentralized system is
a complex process, and the transition to it must be done in a measured
and responsible way over time.
The first step is to create a new cryptocurrency: TXC. Related to the word
“TenXcoin” and conveying a feeling
of being connected to community,
the TenXcoin identity and currency
is designed specifically to bring people together in a new shared economy. 
9
Vision
 But simply creating a digital currency is not enough. This cryptocurrency should be accepted in retail
small business, in large stores and
service providers and online payments. For a cryptocurrency to be
viable, it must also be useful and
valuable. To establish an economy
around the new currency, TenXcoin
must help to establish TXC’s fundamental value.
 Building fundamental value TXC
has been experimenting with forms
of in-app currency in Beta Apps and
Dapps. TenXcoin wanted to see if
users of its apps would be eager to
earn and spend a centralized digital currency. Key to this innovation
was the notion that users would not
have to purchase Tokens but could
instead earn them within the apps.
Useful and valuable
10
Vision
Economic incentive
TenXcoin will build fundamental value for the new currency by integrating TXC into its Apps and DApps.
In the future, users will be able to
earn TXC by providing value to other
members of the digital community
through curation, content creation,
and commerce. Users will be able
to spend TXC on products, services,
and other valuable assets offered by
merchants, developers, influencers,
and other participants. TXC will sit
at the center of a new digital economy inside TenXcoin Apps, driving
demand and fundamental value for
the cryptocurrency. Its resulting value will enable the launch of an economic incentive mechanism, the TXC
Rewards Engine, to further grow the
ecosystem.
11
Funcionality
Useful, quicker and safer
 With our Apps and DApps, TXC will
be useful not only in online stores
but also on physical stores. Similarly to other decentralized cryptocurrency systems, there is no need
for a third-party involvement which
makes it easier if you don’t own a
bank account.
 Mobile portable devices are universally used and it goes hand in hand
with this new currency system. They
work as catalysts for cryptocurrency. It is meant to make its use and
access quicker and safer.
Interactive and gratifying
 Tenxcoin’s goal is to focus on a
more interactive and gratifying customer experience. It’s looking for
personal user gratification, due to its
ever growing mechanism. The more
it’s used, more coins consumers will
receive, exchange and divulge. It is
based on a community and individual reward system.
12
Preserve user’s anonymity
 Each DApp will have a different
purpose which means that consumers vary on an enormous range,
given that its subjects, purposes
and functionalities apply to different
kinds of people and businesses.
 DApps will intend to preserve user’s anonymity since they will not request for any personal information
to be used and its blockchain technology. These DApps will be accessible for any type of user. Its range
will vary from business-oriented decentralized apps to social and family-oriented platforms.
Safe and kid-friendly
Tenxcoin’s based DApps will be safe
and kid-friendly. Despite of not having private information or the need
to create personal accounts, these
DApps will be useful for businesses
in order to possibly collect statistical
data and allow a deeper analysis on
the market for each app. They may
also be a tool for small local businesses to invest and expand themselves. As mentioned before,
the main purpose is to create multiple DApps. Each of them will affect a
particular type; personal, social and
demographic.

Funcionality
Building a Rewards Ecosystem
 The TenXcoin Rewards Engine will use economic incentives to bring other
digital services and applications into the decentralized TenXcoin Ecosystem.
Inspired by previous systems like Bitcoin’s block rewards and Steemit’s posting rewards, the Rewards Engine will create natural incentives for digital service
providers to adopt TXC and become partners in the ecosystem. The ecosystem
will not impose any unnecessary restrictions or tolls on monetization strategies, beyond ensuring common ethics and legality of content and transactions.
As more partners join, the network effect of the TenXcoin Ecosystem will grow,
building the value of the currency, and in turn encouraging new partners to join
this initiative.
 A majority of the TXC supply will be allocated to the operation of the TXC
Rewards Engine. Periodically, the Rewards Engine will unlock and distribute
a specific amount of TXC to be shared among digital service providers in the
TenXcoin Ecosystem. The reward that each partner receives will be proportional
to a measure of the utilization of TXC within that digital service. Such value will
be assessed by a well-defined process that ensures the rewards are distributed fairly using an objective, performance-based methodology. Rewards will be
transparent, auditable, and secure. The TenXcoin Rewards Engine will initially
be administered by TenXcoin. However, over time, it will be decentralized based
on smart contract technology.

Example use cases:
Tipping

the TenXcoin ecosystem. Users are
allowed to reward others for content
they like. From taking surveys to trying new products, tasks are always
quick and easy to complete right
from your phone.
Brand missions
TenXcoin will provide a new way for
brands to directly engage with consumers. Taking advantage of cryptocurrency, brands will be able to
reward users with small amounts
of TXC for completing simple tasks.
This can include answering questions in a survey, creating themed
content, or curating content. Millions TenXcoin Players from nearly
every country in the world will earn
rewards daily with our rewards apps

Implementation
 Ethereum and ERC20
TXC will be implemented on the public Ethereum
blockchain as an ERC20 token.The Ethereum blockchain
is currently the industry standard for issuing custom digital
assets and smart contracts. The
ERC20 token interface allows for
the deployment of a standard token that is compatible with the existing infrastructure of the Ethereum ecosystem, such
as development tools,
wallets, and exchanges.
Ethereum’s ability to deploy
Turing-complete trustless
smart contracts enables complex issuance rules for cryptocurrencies, digital financial contracts, and automated incentive
structures. These advanced features and active ecosystem make
Ethereum a natural fit for TXC.
18
Wallets
TXC Internal wallet
The primary feature required to enable a digital community to use
cryptocurrency is a wallet. As a first
step, TXC will integrate wallets for
each user account. The associated user interface will allow for the
most common wallet interactions.
The wallet shows options such as
deposit, withdrawal, and transaction history, as well as recommendations based on earlier purchases.
Facing the complexity of raw cryptocurrency technology is typically
onerous for most consumers. Issues of transaction fees, private
keys, and alphanumeric addresses
create usability barriers for mainstream users, including the common
requirement to hold cryptocurrency
in the first place in order to obtain
and utilize other tokens.
TXC will aim to significantly reduce
these onboarding frictions. The onboarding process for users will not
require prior expertise with cryptocurrencies before interacting with
TXC.
19
Wallets
ERC20 Token Wallet
Users wishing to transfer TXC into
and out of the TenXcoin applications will be able to do so by interacting with the public Ethereum
network, which will serve as the
currency’s decentralized settlement
layer. Users interacting with TXC inside Apps will have a more managed
experience. This will allow the early
version of the system to solve for
blockchain scalability bottlenecks,
feeless transactions, faster transaction times, and encapsulation of
complex features like private keys.
Over time, TXC will grow with the
development of blockchain technology to accommodate these features in a fully decentralized setting.
