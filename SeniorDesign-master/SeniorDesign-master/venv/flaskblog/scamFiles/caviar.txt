INTRODUCTION
Caviar is the first to offer digital assets and real estate in a single cryptographic token available
on the Ethereum blockchain. Our mission is to provide token holders with a diversified, risk
adjusted, data-driven portfolio with exposure to both stable real estate and select crypto-
currencies and crypto-assets, maximizing return on investment while hedging against markets
downturns. Caviar Platform brings utility to Caviar token holders, enabling real estate developers
to raise money for projects using a crowdfunding mechanism, while providing Caviar token
holders and the underlying fund an opportunity to participate in projects and earn interest.
Caviar will issue tokens in a one-time token sale event, and will invest in fast appreciating
crypto-assets and crypto-currencies, allowing investors to capitalize on the high upside of
digital currency markets, while achieving diversification and profit sharing from a less volatile
and more traditional income-producing short term loan portfolio secured by real estate in the
United States and other countries.
Caviar is the successor to Caviar Capital LP, which, for the past 5 years, has been providing
financing to real estate developers. Fully guaranteed by underlying real estate assets and
unlimited personal guarantees by the borrowers, Caviar Capital provides short term loans
for the purpose of purchasing, improving and selling single and multi-family homes in the
Northeastern United States.
Caviar seeks to capture higher rates of return (“alpha”), while providing a unique opportunity
for crypto-investors to diversify their portfolio through exposure to real estate. At the same
time, Caviar provides traditional investors the upside of high returns in a diversified digital
currencies portfolio. Crypto investors have long sought shelter from volatility in assets like
Tether, Digix, DigiDao and others. However, many of these assets have proven unreliable, with
undercapitalized reserves, and were still prone to volatility.
Caviar’s tokenization approach to    real estate and crypto-assets and currencies lowers
operating costs , reduces entry fees for investors, and removes the “illiquidity barrier” that
keeps investors’ equity locked up for years. Caviar has developed a proprietary Intelligent
Predictive Model for crypto-assets and crypto-currency price forecasting in both short and long
term projection timescales, allowing for stronger predictive power and more effective asset
allocation. To guarantee transparency, Caviar deploys CAView, a proprietary set of monitoring
tools, which provides portfolio audit and guarantees honest and anonymous profit sharing and
distribution.

INVESTMENT THESIS
Caviar seeks to reduce investment volatility (“beta”) while capturing higher than average
rates of return (“alpha”). Caviar will achieve these goals by combining investments in fast-
appreciating crypto-assets with income-generating short-term loans, backed by real estate in
the United States and other countries. By re-allocating funds between crypto and real estate
markets, Caviar aims to provide income and growth via dual market exposure in a single token.
COMPANY HISTORY AND PROFILE
Caviar is the successor to Caviar Capital LP, a real estate debt fund operating since 2013. Over
the past five years, Caviar Capital successfully financed over 20 redevelopment projects. With a
0% default rate, 0 late payments and an average IRR (internal rate of return) of 16% per annum,
Caviar Capital provides its clients and investors a stable, income-producing and dependable
vehicle for financing and investments. Since its inception, Caviar Capital has consistently
outperformed S&P 500 Real Estate1 and S&P 500 Bond2 indices by over 300%
WHAT IS PRIVATE REAL ESTATE LENDING?
A private real estate loan is a broad term that generally describes a short-term loan made at a
higher interest rate. It provides real estate developers with what is sometimes known as bridge
financing. This type of financing helps close the gap between the date when money is needed
and the date when either long-term funding or a buyer for that investment becomes available.
WHY USE PRIVATE REAL ESTATE DEBT?
The reality of this type of loan is that it is often the best financing option when a bank loan is not
available. These types of loans are secured by personal guarantees and real estate as collateral.
THE BENEFITS OF PRIVATE REAL ESTATE LENDING ARE:
•   Fast access to capital for borrowers
•   Higher LTV
•   Construction financing

For investors, this type of lending presents a unique opportunity. U.S. real estate assets are
considered to be among the most stable, yet currently available investment vehicles such as
REITs are expensive to set up and maintain, have a high minimum investment threshold, and
provide slow or no liquidity.
Furthermore, buying, improving and selling real estate assets is a very lucrative business.
In 2013, according to USA Today3, an American newspaper, investors bought and sold over
158,000 properties, for an average profit of over $58,000. In some states, profits exceeded
$100,000 per project. Given the average time it takes to buy, improve and sell a property is
six months, and investors can undertake multiple projects simultaneously, investors can earn
hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars per year.
ASSET TOKENIZATION
Traditionally, if an investor wanted to invest in real
estate, they had two options: either purchase the
real estate directly, or invest in a REIT (Real Estate
Investment Trust). However, both of these options
have  a  number  of  downsides. The  first  option,
buying real estate directly, is a cumbersome and
protracted process, requiring specialized expertise,
time,  and  an  established  ecosystem  of  service
providers. The second option might seem more
attractive, until a deeper look reveals REITs often
have high investment minimums and long periods
of illiquidity. Most importantly, the returns on these
investments have been poor according to The Wall
Street Journal4.
It has become clear that traditional funds such as REITs are inferior in key areas where Caviar’s
tokenized approach excels. According to Professor Stephen McKeon from the University of
Oregon5, tokenizing traditional investment funds solves many challenges.It lowers the cost of
fund management, lowers the administrative costs of friction for investors to enter the fund,
and removes the “illiquidity barrier” that keeps investors’ equity locked up for years. All of
these factors elevate the real returns from Caviar’s real estate investments and allow Caviar to
capture additional “alpha”.

BUSINESS MODEL
Caviar has developed a proprietary, data driven, dual purpose investment model to capture
growth from fast appreciating cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets, while providing exposure to
income generating U.S. real estate.
ADVANTAGES
The rise of blockchain markets produced a number of funds that invest in cryptocurrencies
and assets.   Some of these funds offer their investors profit-sharing options and promise
diversification by keeping a portion of their assets in Bitcoins.   However, in highly volatile
crypto-markets, monthly or quarterly profits are not guaranteed. Although Bitcoin is arguably
the least volatile and most liquid crypto-currency today, it is still part of the same asset class
and is prone to volatility.
Caviar provides investors with an opportunity to diversify their portfolios beyond crypto-
currencies and tokens via the fund’s exposure to lower-risk real estate markets. Caviar is in a
unique position to be able to shift funds from crypto-markets to real estate and vice versa in
order to modify allocation, maximize returns and minimize risk. Caviar’s business model takes a
more balanced approach to investing through a combination of fast-appreciating crypto-assets
and stable income-producing real estate. This is a proven systematic method for achieving
growth and income via dual market exposure in a single token.

CRYPTO INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES
Through strong fundamental analysis and models based on a proprietary framework, Caviar
will be making long term cyclical investments in fast appreciating crypto-currencies and assets
with over $100m in market cap, while also investing in new, high upside projects with “real
world” enablement, payments and finance, blockchain platforms, privacy and other use-cases;
utilizing our proprietary Intelligent Predictive Model.
CAVIAR INTELLIGENT PREDICTIVE MODEL (IPM)
Caviar has developed an innovative predictive model for CryptoAsset (CA) and CryptoCurrency
(CC) price forecasting in both short and long term projection timescales. (Figure 1) The
predictive model relies on historical data to derive linear equations relating historical prices and
growth rates to historical time-variant quantities, and a mixture of time-invariant qualitative/
quantitative metrics. The derived linear equations are then weighted by characteristic R2 values.
These linear equations combined with a suite of patented logical elements are used to project
the growth of a CA in comparison to that of Bitcoin (BTC).
A separate model will take into account trends in the underlying cryptocurrency ecosystem by
analyzing Bitcoin social signals and trends and comparing these metrics to historical Bitcoin
price fluctuations in order to model the underlying trend in the BTC/USD ratio. The BTC/USD
trend model will employ artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and machine learning simulations
to make predictions about future trends and then estimate a BTC/USD ratio at a specified date.
The two models will be calculated independently of one another, and then multiplied to predict
the CA/CC pricing in USD at a specified future date.
Figure 1

PAGE 8 OF 44




Both models will pull data automatically from public sources to instantly update the underlying
algorithms and linear equations in order to make judgments in real time regarding increases
or decreases in CA/CC projected growth and/or risk. The model is fully automated and is
designed to alert analysts when an asset held in a portfolio experiences a significant change
in volatility, when a new asset appears online, or when an asset not currently held in a portfolio
rises above a predetermined expected growth threshold. This real time data collection and
mining, working dynamically with an AI predictive scheme based on machine learning, allows
for stronger predictive power and more effective asset allocation.
REAL ESTATE LENDING ACTIVITIES
A portion of Caviar’s assets will be used
for lending to real estate entrepreneurs
for   the   purposes   of   purchasing,
improving  and  selling  real  estate
assets. Past loans have been extended
mostly in the Northeastern region of the
United States, specifically in the state
of Connecticut (CT), which is located
between two major metropolitan areas -
New York City and Boston. CT is a fairly
small state, and is ranked  #1 in the
United States for per capita income of
$69,311 (from BEA6). The state of CT is

considered one of the biggest insurance hubs in the world, and is home to corporations such
as Aetna, Cigna, The Hartford, as well as Xerox, Sikorski, and many others. Caviar already has
a strong presence, business network and connections spanning the states of CT, MA and NY,
and will continue to build and expand this network regionally if necessary.
The real estate market in the state of CT is very robust. There are many opportunities for Caviar’s
prospective customers to purchase, improve and resell property. According to RealtyTrac, a
real estate statistics service, foreclosures in CT in June 2017 were approximately 14007, up
slightly from around 1300 the same time last year. This reality points to a robust market for our
partners, who are often involved in purchasing foreclosed or distressed property.
Caviar will continue to focus on lending for single and two-family homes in the Northeastern
United States, with a total loan amount of under $500,000, while also expanding to other areas
in US and Europe by utilizing Caviar Platform.  With this model and focus on properties in the
lower to middle price range, a number of advantages exist:
1.  Properties in this price range sell faster
2.  Higher cash re-lending results, thus increasing IRR
3.  Risk profile is lower with a higher number of loans
REAL ESTATE LENDING PROCESS
Caviar follows a strict lending process when issuing debt to its borrowers. The following criteria
are used to determine each applicant’s ability to receive funding:
Borrower CScore above 800
After Rehab Value under 75%
Loan to Value ratio at purchase under 95% including construction cost
Favorable location
Favorable market conditions

APPLICATION AND CREDIT CHECK
Caviar receives an application for a new project and
performs a credit check on the borrower. Caviar
uses a proprietary scoring system called CScore to
rate each borrower. CScore is assigned based on
a number of factors such as experience, Experian       MARKET
credit score, personal net worth and more, and
                                                       Caviar’s team analyzes the local market, number
ranges from 0 to 1000.
of properties for sale, past sales performance and
other factors.
PROPERTY INSPECTION
Caviar’s team meets with the borrower to inspect
and review the property, understand the scope
of work, and determine if the proposed property
improvement budget can be approved by one of           ARV (AFTER REHAB VALUE)
Caviar’s expert estimators. The project can move       DETERMINATION
ahead if the estimator approves the budget.
                                                       After the property inspection, Caviar team
                                                       determines the ARV based on the projected post-
                                                       rehab value of the property. Caviar loans are always
                                                       below 75% of the ARV.
CLOSING
After all due diligence is completed, and both sides
approve the deal, Caviar’s legal team conducts the
closing and funds for property purchase and initial    IMPROVEMENT
draw are released.
Throughout the rehab process, draws are provided
on a previously agreed upon schedule. Before the
next draw is approved, a member of Caviar’s team
personally drives to the property to examine it.
Based on the inspection and the team’s observation
of progress made, the draw is either approved or
denied.

COLLATERAL
All real estate debt provided by Caviar is secured by a personal guarantee from the borrower(s)
as well as a first lien position against the real estate asset. In case of foreclosure, Caviar will
repossess the real estate property, complete the construction needed to bring the project to
market, list and sell the property. Unlike other lenders that only focus on the lending side of the
business, Caviar has the in-house construction infrastructure to help both in underwriting the
asset, and if needed, improving the asset. While some lenders end up foreclosing on bad debt
and then selling the assets for pennies on the dollar, Caviar can use its in-house infrastructure
to complete the deal and sell the asset for a profit. This further de-risks Caviar’s loan portfolio.

CAVIAR PLATFORM
With well over 150,000 real estate assets8 being purchased for purposes of improvement
and resale in the United States every year, and the ability for investors to earn hundreds of
thousands, or even millions of dollars per year, this is an opportunity many are interested in
embracing as a business venture of their own. So there exists a need for a community of peers,
mentors and service providers to educate, disseminate information on deals, and provide peer
to peer communications. This community also gives real estate developers a platform from
which to raise funds for their projects. By building a community of real estate developers and
entrepreneurs, Caviar will further its goals, improve its deal-flow and provide token holders with
additional opportunity to earn profits.

Caviar will use part of the proceeds from the token sale to build an advanced platform that will
include:
•   Community boards for education and mentorship
•   A crowdfunding platform for Caviar token holders and real estate developers
V1.02202018
PAGE 16 OF 44




Caviar Platform will be open to anyone in the world for viewing. Participants in project funding
activities will be required to:
•   Register and complete KYC/AML verification
•   Have a minimum required balance of CAV tokens in their wallets
Caviar has a strong network and footprint in USA and will start accepting US-based real estate
projects only. This will be followed by EU countries that have the highest demand for short term
real estate financing.
To list projects on Caviar platform developers will be required to:
•   Register and complete KYC/AML verification
•   Submit detailed information about the project, including:
»   Project details (location, estimated before and after value)
»   Requested loan amount
»   Loan term length (up to 12 months)
»   Annual/Monthly interest
»   Detailed description of improvements, including number of stages for work
completion and draw amounts requested for each stage of the project (if applicable)
»   Accepted payment (BTC, ETH, CAV, USD)
•   Pay a one-time listing & pre-screening fee
Caviar will conduct full due diligence of every property, including but not limited to:
•   Review of documentation
•   Title search
•   Price verification
•   Budget review
•   On-site property inspection by a Caviar partner
V1.02202018
PAGE 17 OF 44




Caviar will take first lien position against every project funded through the network. In case of
a default, Caviar will execute a foreclosure or a lien-in-lieu process to repossess the property,
sell it and return the proceeds to investors.
Active Caviar community members and service providers may also participate in all projects
by offering services such as property inspections, appraisals or other contractor work in return
for CAV tokens.
Caviar reserves the right to make selective investments into projects listed on the Caviar
platform, at the same terms as other investors. This is an additional benefit to both Caviar and
real estate developers looking to quickly raise funds for their projects.
Caviar will charge 5% fee of the funds collected.  If the project does not reach its funding goal,
the funds will be returned to the participants and the fee will not be charged.

AUDIT AND SECURITY
Caviar will utilize CAView, a proprietary set of monitoring tools that allows investors to verify
funds’ activities including loan payments, trading histories, balance, etc. It guarantees full
transparency and honest and anonymous profit sharing and distribution.
Caviar will use the highest security standards, including multi-signature hardware, cold storage
and secure wallets.
Caviar will also undergo an accounting audit post token sale by a reputable firm.
COMPLIANCE
Caviar intends to comply with all applicable regulations before, during and after the token sale.
All applicable laws as well as KYC/AML will be applied.

To facilitate a better understanding of the Caviar Tokens being offered for purchase by
the Caviar, and the businesses and operations of the Caviar, certain technical terms and
abbreviations, as well as, in certain instances, their descriptions, have been used in this White
Paper. These descriptions and assigned meanings should not be treated as being definitive of
their meanings and may not correspond to standard industry meanings or usage.
Words importing the singular shall, where applicable, include the plural and vice versa and
words importing the masculine gender shall, where applicable, include the feminine and neuter
genders and vice versa. References to persons shall include corporations.
3.3                                                                                                       FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
All statements, estimates and financial information contained in this White Paper, made in any

and profitability, prospects, future plans, other expected industry trends and other matters
discussed in this White Paper regarding Caviar are matters that are not historic facts, but only
predictions.
Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
factors which may cause actual events or results, performance or achievements to differ
materially from the estimates or the results implied or expressed in such forward-looking
statements. These factors include, amongst others:
a.  changes in political, social, economic and stock or cryptocurrency market conditions, and
the regulatory environment in the countries in which the Caviar conducts its respective
businesses and operations;
b.  the risk that the Caviar may be unable or execute or implement their respective business
strategies and future plans;
c.  changes in interest rates and exchange rates of fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies;

undertaking as to the future performance or policies of the Caviar.

material change in the affairs, conditions and prospects of Caviar or in any statement of fact
or information contained in this White Paper since the date hereof.

PAPER

4.                                                                                                      DISCLOSURES REGARDING CAVIAR TOKENS
4.1                                                                                                     NATURE OF CAVIAR TOKENS
Except as explicitly set out in the White Paper, Caviar Tokens do not have any rights, uses,
purpose, attributes, functionalities or features, express or implied, including, without limitation,
any uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features on the Caviar Platform. Caviar does
not guarantee and is not representing in any way to Purchaser that the Caviar Tokens have any
rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features. The purchase of Caviar Tokens
does not provide Purchaser with rights of any form with respect to the Caviar or its revenues or
assets, including, but not limited to, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary
(including all forms of intellectual property), or other financial or legal rights; is not a loan to
Caviar; and does not provide Purchaser with any ownership or other interest in Caviar.

4.2                                                                                                   CAVIAR TOKENS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE
Other than instances described in the White Paper related to the non-completion of the Token
Launch, Caviar is not obliged to provide Caviar Token holders with a refund for any reason,
and Caviar Token holders will not receive money or other compensation in lieu of a refund.
Statements set out in the White Paper are merely expressions of the Caviar’s objectives and
desired work plan to achieve those objectives. and no promises of future performance or price
are or will be made in respect to Caviar Tokens, including no promise of inherent value, and no
guarantee that Caviar Tokens will hold any particular value.
4.3                                                                                                   CAVIAR TOKENS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS
The Caviar Tokens are provided on “as is” basis. The Caviar Parties and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, shareholders, affiliates and licensors make no representations
or warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise regarding the Caviar
Tokens, including any warranty that the Caviar Tokens and Caviar Platform will be uninterrupted,
error-free or free of harmful components, secure or not otherwise lost or damaged. Except to
the extent prohibited by applicable law, the Caviar Parties and each of their respective directors,
officers, employees, shareholders, affiliates and licensors disclaim all warranties, including any
implied warranties of merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, non-
infringement, or quiet enjoyment, and any warranties arising out of any course of dealings,
usage or trade.
4.4                                                                                                   NON-INVESTMENT PURPOSES
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser is not purchasing Caviar Tokens for
purposes of investment, speculation, as some type of arbitrage strategy, for immediate resale
or other financial purposes.
4.5                                                                                                   CAVIAR TOKENS MAY HAVE NO VALUE
The Caviar Tokens may have no value and there is no guarantee or representation of liquidity
for Caviar Tokens. The Caviar is not and shall not be responsible for or liable for the market
value of the Caviar Tokens, the transferability and/or liquidity of the Caviar Tokens and/or the
availability of any market for Caviar Tokens through third parties or otherwise.
4.6                                                                                                   LACK OF DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET FOR CAVIAR TOKENS
There are no warranties that Caviar Tokens will be listed or made available for exchange for
other cryptocurrency and/or fiat money. It shall be explicitly cautioned that if Caviar Tokens
V1.02202018
PAGE 31 OF 44




are made available on an exchange, such exchange, if any, may not be subject to regulatory
oversight, and the Caviar does not give any warranties in relation to any exchange services
providers. Because there has been no prior public trading market for Caviar Tokens, the Token
Launch may not result in an active or liquid market for Caviar Tokens, and the price of Caviar
Tokens may be volatile. Caviar Token holders may not be able to dispose of Caviar Tokens
easily and where no secondary market develops, a Caviar Token holder may not be able to
liquidate at all.
4.7                                                                                                   RISKS RELATING TO HIGHLY SPECULATIVE PRICES
The valuation of cryptocurrency in a secondary market is usually not transparent, and highly
speculative. The Caviar Tokens do not hold any ownership rights to the Caviar’s assets and,
therefore, are not backed by any tangible asset. The value Caviar Tokens in the secondary
market, any, may fluctuate greatly within a short period of time. There is a high risk that a
Purchaser could lose its entire contribution amount. In the worst-case scenario, Caviar Tokens
could be rendered worthless.
4.8                                                                                                   FORCE MAJEURE
The Token Launch and the performance of the Caviar’s activities set out in White Paper
development roadmap may be interrupted, suspended or delayed due to force majeure
circumstances. For the purposes of this White Paper, force majeure shall mean extraordinary
events and circumstances which could not be prevented by Caviar and shall include: changes
in market forces or the technology, acts of nature, wars, armed conflicts, mass civil disorders,
industrial actions, epidemics, lockouts, slowdowns, prolonged shortage or other failures of
energy supplies or communication service, acts of municipal, state or federal governmental
agencies, other circumstances beyond Caviar’s control, which were not in existence at the time
of Token Launch.
4.9                                                                                                   INSURANCE
Unlike bank accounts or accounts at financial institutions, Caviar Tokens are uninsured unless
you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of
utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by Caviar to offer recourse
to Purchaser.

5.                                                                                                     GOVERNMENTAL DISCLOSURES
5.1                                                                                                    CAVIAR IS NOT A REGULATED MUTUAL FUND
Caviar is not regulated as a mutual fund for the purpose of the Mutual Funds Law (Revised)
of the Cayman Islands on the basis that Caviar Tokens are not shares and Caviar is not a
mutual fund, and neither a copy of this White Paper or details about Caviar have been filed with
Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA). Because Caviar is not a regulated mutual fund,
Caviar is not subject to the supervision of CIMA and Caviar is not required to have its accounts
audited nor submit such accounts to CIMA.
If Caviar were regulated as a mutual fund under the Mutual Funds Law (Revised), it would
need to comply with regulatory requirements designed to protect investors, including the
requirement to limit the minimum aggregate token purchase amount to USD $100,000 or its
equivalent in any other currency in order for it not to be licensed or administered by a licensed
mutual fund administrator. Caviar would also need to pay a prescribed initial registration fee.
These are matters which would be required in connection with an initial registration under the
Mutual Funds Law. Caviar would also then have ongoing obligations under the Mutual Funds
Law following its initial registration, including the obligation to
n.  to file with CIMA prescribed details of any changes to this White Paper;
o.  to file annually with CIMA accounts audited by an approved auditor and a fund annual
return; and
p.  to pay a prescribed annual fee.
If Caviar were a regulated mutual fund, it would also be subject to the supervision of CIMA, and
CIMA would have wide powers to take certain actions if certain events occur.
5.2                                                                                                    RISK OF UNFAVORABLE REGULATORY ACTION IN ONE OR MORE
JURISDICTIONS
The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets, and blockchain technology is
undeveloped, varies significantly among jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty.
It is possible that certain jurisdictions may adopt laws, regulations, policies or rules directly or
indirectly affecting the Bitcoin and Ethereum network, or restricting the right to acquire, own,
hold, sell, convert, trade, or use Caviar Tokens. Developments in laws, regulations, policies or
rules may alter the nature of the operation of the blockchain network upon which the Caviar
Tokens are dependent.
V1.02202018
PAGE 33 OF 44




There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not examine the operations
of Caviar Parties and/or pursue enforcement actions against Caviar Parties. All of this may
subject Caviar Parties to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Caviar Parties
to restructure their operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services,
all of which could harm Caviar Parties’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which
may, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Caviar Tokens and/or the development of
the Caviar Platform.
5.3                                                                                                 PURCHASER BEARS RESPONSIBILITY OF LEGAL CATEGORISATION
There is a risk that Caviar Tokens might be considered a security in certain jurisdictions, or
that they might be considered to be a security in the future. The Caviar does not provide any
warranty or guarantee as to whether the Caviar Tokens will be a security in the jurisdiction of
the Purchaser. Each Purchaser will bear all consequences of Caviar Tokens being considered
a security in their respective jurisdiction. Every Purchaser is responsible to confirm if the
acquisition and/or disposal of Caviar Tokens is legal in its relevant jurisdiction, and each
Purchaser undertakes not to use Caviar Tokens in any jurisdiction where doing so would be
unlawful. If a Purchaser establishes that the purchase or use of Caviar Tokens is not legal in
its jurisdiction, it should not acquire Caviar Tokens and immediately stop using or possessing
Caviar Tokens.
Acquiring Caviar Tokens in exchange for cryptocurrency will most likely continue to be
scrutinized by various regulatory bodies around the world, which may impact the usage of
Caviar Tokens. The legal ability of the Caviar to provide or support Caviar Tokens in some
jurisdictions may be eliminated by future regulation or legal actions. In the event the Caviar
determines that the purchase or usage of Caviar Tokens is illegal in a certain jurisdiction, the
Caviar may cease operations in that jurisdiction, or adjust Caviar Tokens in a way to comply
with applicable law.
5.4                                                                                                 PURCHASER BEARS RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPLYING WITH
TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS
Caviar Tokens may be placed on third-party exchanges, giving future purchasers and users an
opportunity to openly buy Caviar Tokens. A user seeking to enter the Caviar Platform following
the Token Launch will have to buy Caviar Tokens on such exchanges. Conversely, Caviar Tokens
may be sold on such exchanges if the holder of Caviar Tokens would like to exit the Caviar
Platform ecosystem. Existing laws on the circulation of securities in certain countries, such as
the United States of America and Singapore, may prohibit the sale of the Caviar Tokens to the
residents of those countries. When buying Caviar Tokens, Purchaser should be aware of the
restrictions on their subsequent sale.

6.                                                                                                    GENERAL SECURITY RISKS
6.1                                                                                                   RISK OF THEFT AND HACKING
Token generation events and initial coin offerings are often targeted by hackers and bad actors.
Hackers may attempt to interfere with the Purchaser’s digital wallet, whether located on the
Caviar Platform or otherwise, (Purchaser’s Wallet), the Caviar Smart Contract or the availability
of Caviar Tokens in any number of ways, including without limitation denial of service attacks,
Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks. Any such
attack may result in theft of Purchaser’s Caviar Tokens.
6.2                                                                                                   PRIVATE KEYS
Caviar Tokens purchased by Purchaser may be held by Purchaser in Purchaser’s digital wallet
or vault, which requires a private key, or a combination of private keys, for access. Accordingly,
loss of requisite private key(s) associated with Purchaser’s digital wallet or vault storing Caviar
Tokens will result in loss of such Caviar Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to
such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet or vault
service Purchaser uses, may be able to misappropriate Purchaser’s Caviar Tokens. Caviar is
not responsible for any such losses.
6.3                                                                                                   FAILURE TO MAP A PUBLIC KEY TO PURCHASER’S WALLET
Failure of the Purchaser to map a public key to such Purchaser’s Wallet may result in third-
parties being unable to recognize buyer’s Caviar Token balance on the Ethereum blockchain
when and if they configure the initial balances of a new blockchain based upon the Caviar

                                                                                                      The wallet or wallet service provider used for the acquisition and storage of the Caviar Tokens
                                                                                                      has to be technically compatible with the Caviar Tokens. The failure to assure this may result
                                                                                                      in the Purchaser not being able to gain access to its Caviar Tokens.
6.5                                                                                                   RISK OF WEAKNESSES OR EXPLOITABLE BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE
FIELD OF CRYPTOGRAPHY
Advances in cryptography, or other technical advances such as the development of quantum
computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Caviar Tokens, which could
result in the theft or loss of Caviar Tokens.

There are risks associated with using Caviar Tokens including, but not limited to, the failure
of hardware, software, and internet connections. The Caviar shall not be responsible for any
communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when
using the Caviar Platform and Caviar Tokens, howsoever caused. Transactions in cryptocurrency
may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may
not be recoverable. Cryptocurrency transactions are deemed to be made when recorded on a
public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time when the transaction is initiated.
7.                                                                                                   CAVIAR PLATFORM DISCLOSURES
7.1                                                                                                  NO GUARANTEE THAT CAVIAR SMART CONTRACT WILL BE
DEVELOPED
Purchaser acknowledges, understands and agrees that Purchaser should not expect and there
is no guarantee or representation or warranty by Caviar that: (a) the Caviar Platform will ever be
adopted; (b) the Caviar Platform will be adopted as developed by Caviar and not in a different
or modified form; (c) a blockchain utilizing or adopting the Caviar will ever be launched; and
(d) a blockchain will ever be launched with or without changes to the Caviar Platform and
with or without a distribution matching the fixed balance of Initial Tokens (as defined below).
Furthermore, the Tokens initially generated upon the Token Launch (Initial Tokens) will not have
any functionality or rights on the Caviar Platform and holding Initial Tokens is not a guarantee,
representation or warranty that the holder will be able to use the Caviar Platform, or receive any
tokens utilized on the Caviar Platform, even if the Caviar Platform is launched and the Caviar
Smart Contract is adopted, of which there is no guarantee, representation or warranty made by
Caviar.
7.2                                                                                                  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CAVIAR SMART CONTRACT AND
ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE AND/OR INFRASTRUCTURE.
The Caviar Smart Contract is based on the Ethereum blockchain. As such, any malfunction,
unintended function or unexpected functioning of the Ethereum protocol may cause Caviar
Tokens and/or the Caviar Platform to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended
manner.
The Ethereum blockchain rests on open source software, and accordingly there is the risk that
the Caviar Smart Contract may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which
V1.02202018
PAGE 36 OF 44




may negatively affect Caviar Tokens or result in the loss or theft of Caviar Tokens or the loss
of ability to access or control Caviar Tokens. In the event of such a software bug or weakness,
there may be no remedy and Caviar Token holders are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or
compensation.
On the Ethereum blockchain timing of block production is determined by proof of work so block
production can occur at random times. For example, Ether transferred to Caviar’s recipient digital
wallet address in the final seconds of a distribution period may not get included for that period.
Purchaser acknowledges and understands that the Ethereum blockchain may not include the
Purchaser’s transaction at the time Purchaser expects and Purchaser may not receive Caviar
Tokens the same day Purchaser sends Ether. The Ethereum blockchain is prone to periodic
congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Individuals may also intentionally
spam the Ethereum network in an attempt to gain an advantage in purchasing cryptographic
tokens. Purchaser acknowledges and understands that Ethereum block producers may not
include Purchaser’s transaction when Purchaser wants or Purchaser’s transaction may not be
included at all.
Ether, the native unit of account of the Ethereum may itself lose value in ways similar to Caviar
Tokens, and also other ways. More information about Ethereum is available at http://www.
ethereum.org
7.3                                                                                                    IRREVERSIBLE NATURE OF BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTIONS
Transactions involving Caviar Tokens that have been verified, and thus recorded as a block on
the blockchain, generally cannot be undone. Even if the transaction turns out to have been in
error, or due to theft of a user’s Caviar Token, the transaction is not reversible. Further, at this
time, there is no governmental, regulatory, investigative, or prosecutorial authority or mechanism
through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen cryptocurrencies and
digital tokens. Consequently, the Caviar may be unable to replace missing Caviar Tokens or
seek reimbursement for any erroneous transfer or theft of Caviar Tokens.
7.4                                                                                                    AMENDMENTS TO PROTOCOL
The development team and administrators of the source code for Ethereum blockchain or the
Caviar Smart Contract could propose amendments to such network’s protocols and software
that, if accepted and authorized, or not accepted, by the network community, could adversely
affect the supply, security, value, or market share of Caviar Tokens.

7.5                                                                                                     RISK OF MINING ATTACKS
As with other decentralized cryptocurrencies, Ethereum blockchain, which is used for the
Caviar Tokens, is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend
attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks.
Any successful attacks present a risk to the Caviar Tokens, expected proper execution and
sequencing of Caviar Tokens, and expected proper execution and sequencing of Ethereum
contract computations in general. Despite the efforts of the Caviar and Ethereum Foundation,
the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists. Mining attacks, as described above, may also
target other blockchain networks, with which the Caviar Tokens interact with and consequently
the Caviar Tokens may be impacted also in that way to the extent described above.
8.                                                                                                      CAVIAR DISCLOSURES
8.1                                                                                                     LEGAL STRUCTURE OF TOKEN GENERATOR
The Issuer is an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands pursuant to the
Companies Law (Revised). An exempted company is a body corporate which has separate legal
personality capable of exercising all the functions of a natural person of full capacity irrespective
of any question of corporate benefit, and having perpetual succession. The constitution of an
exempted company is contained in two documents, the memorandum of association and the
articles of association (Articles). The Articles typically provide that there must be at least one
director of a Cayman company. Generally, the Articles will specify that the management of a
Cayman company is the responsibility of, and is carried out by, its board of directors. If the
Articles permit it, a Cayman company may indemnify officers and directors of the company
from all liabilities and expenses incurred by search persons in the performance of their duties.
The memorandum of association of a Cayman company must specify the authorised share
capital of such company. The memorandum of association will state the aggregate amount
of the authorised share capital, together with details of the number of shares into which it is
divided and the par value of those shares. As a Caviar Token holder, you are not entitled to any
right or interest in or to shares of Caviar and have no rights to appoint or remove the board of
directors of Caviar.
Because Caviar Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Caviar
platform or Caviar, all decisions involving the Company’s products or services within the
platform or Caviar itself will be made by Caviar at its sole discretion. These decisions could
adversely affect the platform and the utility of any Caviar Token you own.

8.2                                                                                                DEPENDENCE ON MANAGEMENT TEAM
The ability of the Caviar Platform project team which is responsible for maintaining competitive
position of the Caviar Platform is dependent to a large degree on the services of a senior
management team. The loss or diminution in the services of members of such senior
management team or an inability to attract, retain and maintain additional senior management
personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Caviar Platform. Competition for
personnel with relevant expertise is intense due to the small number of qualified individuals,
and this competition may seriously affect the Caviar’s ability to retain its existing senior
management and attract additional qualified senior management personnel, which could have
a significant adverse impact on the Caviar Platform.
8.3                                                                                                RISKS RELATED TO RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES
Even if completed, the Caviar Platform will rely, in whole or partly, on third-parties to adopt
and implement it and to continue to develop, supply, and otherwise support it. There is no
assurance or guarantee that those third-parties will complete their work, properly carry out
their obligations, or otherwise meet anyone’s needs, any of which might have a material adverse
effect on the Caviar Platform.
8.4                                                                                                INSUFFICIENT INTEREST IN THE CAVIAR PLATFORM AND CAVIAR
TOKENS
It is possible that the Caviar Platform or Caviar Tokens will not be used by a large number
of individuals, businesses and organizations and that there will be limited public interest in
the creation and development of its functionalities. Such a lack of interest could impact the
development of the Caviar Platform.
8.5                                                                                                CAVIAR PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT RISKS
The development of the Caviar Platform and/or Caviar Smart Contract may be abandoned
for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of
commercial success or prospects, or departure of key personnel.
8.6                                                                                                CHANGES TO CAVIAR PLATFORM
The Caviar Platform is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time.
Although Caviar Parties intend for the Caviar Platform to have the features and specifications
set forth in this White Paper, changes to such features and specifications may be made for any
V1.02202018
PAGE 39 OF 44




number of reasons, any of which may mean that the Caviar Platform does not meet expectations
of the Purchaser.
8.7                                                                                                  OTHER PROJECTS
The Platform may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by parties that are affiliated
or unaffiliated with the Caviar Parties, and such projects may provide no benefit to the Caviar
Platform.
8.8                                                                                                  DISCLOSURES RELATING TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Any of the Caviar Parties may be engaged in transactions with related parties and conflicts
of interest may arise, potentially resulting in the conclusion of transactions on terms not
determined by market forces.
9.                                                                                                   EXCLUDED PERSONS
CAV will not be sold to anyone where the acquisition by such a person would cause a breach
of the law or requirements of any country or governmental authority, including anti-money
laundering regulations or conventions. In addition to the foregoing, the following persons
(Purchaser) are explicitly restricted from purchasing CAV:
9.1                                                                                                  a Purchaser who is a member of the public in the Cayman Islands;
9.2                                                                                                  a Purchaser on behalf of terrorists or terrorist organisations, including those persons
or entities that are included on the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked
Persons maintained by the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control1
(OFAC);

member of a senior foreign political figure’s immediate family or any close associate
of a senior foreign political figure2 unless Caviar, after being specifically notified by
the Purchaser in writing that it is such a person, conducts further due diligence, and
determines that the investment is permitted;
9.4                                                                                                                    a Purchaser or an entity acting as trustee, agent, representative or nominee for a
Purchaser that is a foreign shell bank3;
9.5                                                                                                                    a Purchaser who makes representations or warranties in the Terms and Conditions
that are not true when given or have ceased to be true;
9.6                                                                                                                    a Purchaser whose circumstances are such that, in the opinion of Caviar’s directors,
its continued ownership of CAV would cause an undue risk of adverse tax or other
consequences to Caviar. Those circumstances include those that affect that
Purchaser directly or indirectly, whether taken alone or in conjunction with another
person or persons, connected or not, or any other circumstance that appears to the
directors to be relevant; and
2                                                                                                                      Senior foreign political figure means a senior official in the executive, legislative, administrative, military or
judicial branches of a foreign government (whether elected or not), a senior official of a major foreign political
party or a senior executive of a foreign government-owned corporation. In addition a senior foreign political
figure includes any corporation, business or other entity that has been formed by, or for the benefit of, a senior
foreign political figure. The immediate family of a senior foreign political figure typically includes the political
figure’s parents, siblings, spouse, children and in-laws. A close associate of a senior foreign political figure is
a person who is widely and publicly known internationally to maintain an unusually close relationship with the
senior foreign political figure, and includes a person who is in a position to conduct substantial domestic and
international financial transactions on behalf of the senior foreign political figure.

9.7                                                                                             a Purchaser, or a Purchaser that is an entity acting as trustee, agent, representative or
nominee for a person, who is a United States person (within the meaning of Rule 902
of Regulation S of the United States Securities Act, as amended).4 The Purchaser
must notify Caviar immediately if the Purchaser becomes a United States person or
becomes aware that any person for whom the Purchaser holds shares as trustee,
agent, representative or nominee has become a United States person. Despite this,
if Caviar chooses to comply fully with applicable U.S. laws and regulations, Caviar
may arrange for the private placement of CAV to Purchasers who are in the United
States or who are U.S. Persons if, among other things, each such Purchaser delivers
to Caviar a completed form of these Terms and Conditions that contains certain
representations, warranties and agreements in accordance with applicable U.S. laws
and regulations before acquiring any CAV.
10.                                                                                             REGULATION S ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
As stated in Caviar’s whitepaper and related terms and conditions, our offering of CAV tokens
is being conducted outside of the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation
S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and as a result, U.S.
persons within the meaning of such regulation are prohibited from purchasing CAV tokens
in the offering. Prior to the release of the CAV token to you, you must confirm, and provide
