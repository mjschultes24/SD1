SUMMARY
Creating a zero emission world may be both the greatest environmental challenge & the greatest financial
opportunity of our generation.
Buildings cause 33% of global climate changing greenhouse gases through the energy they consume. When
buildings use less energy, they can lower their operating costs and become significantly more valuable. In fact,
reducing their emissions by reducing their energy consumption may unlock more than $6.5 trillion in global
asset value. So why hasn’t this happened yet?
The Problem. Getting the right data to make the best decisions about energy efficiency in buildings is difficult.
A building’s energy use, operational and asset value data is rarely available. If it is, it is typically siloed in
vendor hardware and software products, walled off from one another in expensive proprietary solutions.
Without easy access to data, building owners and investors have had difficulty proving how specific
investments in building technology impact energy use and the bottom line.
The Solution. Bluenote will pull these data streams out of buildings and standardize it through a distributed
blockchain solution called the Bluenote Protocol. The Bluenote Protocol is an open-access, confidential
network that enables simple data sharing, data services, and building analysis in order to unlock new energy
efficiency strategies in buildings. The software-based Bluenote Protocol can be used both with new
applications and with energy technologies already installed in buildings throughout the world.
The Token. The Bluenote token is ERC20-compliant, utilizing smart contracts, which will be tradable under the
ticker BNOW. Buildings and devices that integrate the Bluenote Protocol and share data are rewarded in
Bluenote tokens. Buildings can then buy and use Bluenote tokens to purchase energy efficiency analytics on
the Bluenote Protocol.
The Marketplace. The Bluenote Protocol simplifies and speeds up the energy efficiency service market. Rather
than developing dedicated hardware and software integration for each vendor, a building connected to the
protocol can buy a service with Bluenote tokens, and simply point the application to the location of their data
already on the Bluenote Protocol. Further, as more data becomes linked through the Bluenote Protocol,
applications will be able to mine the large data network for insights into building efficiency strategies that
work, while preserving the confidentiality of the buildings sharing the data.
Who will use Bluenote?
● Building Owners and Managers can make retrofit decisions they can trust.
● Energy Tech Companies can have instantaneous access to building customers.
● Utilities gain a new way to manage the demand and costs of energy in real time.
● Financial Institutions can trace a change in asset value to verified energy reductions.
The Bluenote Protocol is a potentially revolutionary technology with a unique approach to the market. Where
other blockchain solutions in the energy industry simply attempt to tokenize energy trading, Bluenote instead
opens up an entirely new market for decentralized energy efficiency data services in buildings.

hy are we
doing this?
Since the climate conference COP21 in Paris in 2015, an international group of like-minded entrepreneurs, experts and investors have
worked together as the Bluenote Foundation to solve the biggest
problem on earth, climate change, without being bound to the constraints ofinvestors or politicians. They focused on globally accessible CO2 emission limiting solutions, with a healthy financial return.
Through the Bluenote Protocol, we can set the data free, allowing
innovators to create new products, and even entirely new markets,
based on analyzing a new universe of high-quality and high-frequency
data from buildings around the world. With the Bluenote token as an
incentive method, buildings can enter these new markets outside of
their traditional annual budgeting cycle, creating a virtuous cycle of
reinvestment in efficiency strategies.

The Bluenote Foundation has as its core mission to lead the transition to zero emission cities, but to do so in
a way that is environmentally, economically and socially sustainable.
Bluenote tackles the largest polluter first
According to the United Nations, more than two thirds of the world’s population will live in cities by 2050. At
present, office buildings in cities are the largest source of CO2 emissions, with all the consequences.
Worldwide, buildings are estimated to be responsible for 33% of all CO2 emissions.
By way of example, according to the New York Green Bank, commercial real estate accounts for 67% of all CO2
emissions in New York City1
.
Commercial real estate is the low-hanging fruit of the energy world
The real estate world is driven by traditional financial models, and technological advancements must conform
to key industry drivers to for solutions to gain traction. Bluenote will accelerate the adoption of building
energy technology upgrades by providing the transparency, trusted data and data analysis capabilities that
support investment decisions in energy efficiency measures.
You cannot improve what you cannot measure
As governments, companies and individuals around the world launch ambitious initiatives to reduce emissions
from the power sector, real-time measurement and verification of those efforts has lagged behind. When
measurement does occur, it often is part of an upfront estimate of costs and benefits, or after the fact through
a lengthy, consultant-driven analysis. Now that we are seeing more granular and timely data on energy usage,
we can use that data to: a) prove that an action or initiative has resulted in less energy used and less emissions
than would have occurred otherwise while it is happening, and b) create confidence in measurements for
emission reductions or societal values that can be trusted.
More efficient buildings are more valuable buildings
The long-term goal is to prove that the highest-performing energy buildings are also the most profitable form
of real estate investment, leading to a shift in the market that drives emissions downward. A study done in
collaboration between Deutsche Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation calculates that reducing just 30% of the
electricity expenses borne by commercial buildings in the United States is worth $100 billion annually. The
Bluenote Protocol will help unlock building asset value globally by creating the link between verified energy
performance and financial returns.
Blockchain offers the best way to make the Bluenote Protocol successful
The Bluenote Protocol recognizes the simple fact that there is value in energy efficiency data. With a
decentralized platform and independent governance, anyone is able to verify and value data and results,
allowing for a new, global trust in energy efficiency.

The Bluenote Protocol is designed to collect, process and analyze data in a decentralized manner. It is designed
to share all value it creates through Bluenote tokens. There is no dividend, there are no shareholders, there
are only bluenotes and all possible value that the ecosystem contains, will translate into the value of those
bluenotes.
Only a neutral, decentralized protocol can make this happen
Governmental entities cannot initiate such a project on their own, because it falls outside of regular policy
instruments. Further, as the protocol stretches across borders and across industry sectors, there is no common
government agency to oversee it.
Large companies in the energy and buildings industry have proven they can only hoard this data, not exchange
it or value it for those who produce it. The large industry players today have developed a reputation for
working poorly with competitors and being biased towards their own solutions and ecosystems.

WHY COMMERCIAL OFFICE BUILDINGS?
According to the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) 33% all of global emissions are caused by
buildings and the electricity they consume.2
While residential and industrial buildings also play a substantial role, commercial real estate is governed by
more rational and quantitative decision-making. Buildings are durable assets that have decades of useful
lifespan3
. That means when they are constructed, developers choose materials and energy controls; and those
choices can lock in the building’s greenhouse gas emissions footprint.
Building owners and the banks that finance the purchase and development of these assets haven’t
traditionally looked at energy usage as a key metric. They focus more on asset appreciation and cash flow than
energy use, which is viewed largely as an expense over which they have little influence. However, giving
buildings the tools to uncover the financial impacts and opportunities of changing their energy systems can
more clearly illustrate the ROI of each potential upgrade and, more importantly, the opportunity to improve
the underlying asset valuation.
If we can reduce the friction in the energy efficiency market, prove that efficiency strategies
work, and demonstrate the impact of improved energy performance on asset value, we will
be able to drive a market-based solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
The market is beginning to draw the connections between building energy use and asset performance. For
example, buildings that use more energy than necessary have been shown to be at greater risk to default on
their debt obligations4
. This is an important factor for both building developers and the institutional investors
that provide traditional financing, because it shines a light on potential underlying investment risk.
The question becomes, then, if it is possible to not only mitigate energy-related investment risk by taking
preventative measures, but also to identify which specific activities can help buildings cross the threshold into
creating greater cash flow and return potential.
While every building is unique and demands a customized approach to reducing energy expenditures, financial
models for commercial real estate are relatively uniform throughout the global market. Understanding and
helping buildings identify the specific elements that can help them reach their energy goals drives investment
decisions. Accelerating energy efficiency retrofit activity can then also accelerate the reduction of greenhouse
gas emissions that result from building energy use.

OPENING UP THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY MARKET
Building efficiency is the cheapest form of energy
While buildings are responsible for 33% of global emissions, building energy efficiency represents 40% of the
greenhouse gas reduction potential that can be achieved cost-effectively.5 On a cents/kilowatt-hour basis,
comparing the levelized cost of energy over the life of the investments among all energy investments in the
power sector, energy efficiency comes in significantly below its fossil-fuel, uranium, and even carbon-free
competitors.6
Energy consumption in buildings can be reduced by 30% to 80% using proven and commercially
available technologies.7

Energy efficiency services market exceeds $118 billion/yr.
Global energy efficiency investment in buildings has been increasing, and in 2015 reached USD 118 billion,
according to the IEA.8 Globally, energy services companies (ESCOs) generated USD 24 billion in revenue in
2016.9 In the United States, ESCO revenues reached USD 6.3 billion, in the European Union they were USD 2.7
billion, in China, USD 13.3 billion.10
Energy efficiency investment by region and sector
There remain significant barriers at the building level and the system level that have impeded the potential of
this market:
Data in buildings is imprisoned in vendor and hardware silos
Today, valuable data on a building’s energy, operations, and finances, when it exists, is trapped in a menagerie
of silos: with hardware vendors, software as a service, the manager’s own spreadsheets. Even the most
advanced building energy intelligence platforms are limited to models, proprietary datasets, and assumptions.
Risk and uncertainty
Buildings typically finance energy efficiency investments through an operating budget with an expected
payback in reduced utility bills. That often means buildings usually pursue projects with a payback of less than
two years. When a specific energy efficiency strategy is unproven or has an uncertain impact within the
shorter-term lifecycle of a commercial office property, buildings do not take the risk. Their willingness to take a
risk on an efficiency strategy decreases as the payback term increases, and they simply don’t trust the
numbers enough from the vendor selling them the product or solution to overcome that hurdle.

PROVING MEASUREMENT AND VERIFICATION
Shining a light on efficiency performance creates confidence in investments
Bluenote will establish a new foundation for long-term trustable quantification of energy efficiency impacts to
enable policies and policy-directed markets to work.
The opportunity to measure energy efficiency impacts at a granular level has begun to emerge in the building
sector with digital metering and operations equipment. An increased understanding of and trust in energy
efficiency performance would unlock the opportunity to have investments be funded not from cash
flow/operations, but through third party financial instruments.
Markets work on trust
Historically, there has been a lack of quality real time information on the results and impacts of energy
efficiency strategies. There is a reason that most blockchain solutions in the energy industry have focused on
buying electricity generation (from renewable or from wholesale markets), and that is simply because that
energy can be recorded on a trusted electricity meter that is good enough to be billed on by a utility. If you can
bring that same level of trust to the reduction of energy use in real time, you could find ways to credit and
value that energy reduction at the same, or greater, level as energy production.
This is not a trend we will start on our own. With more confidence in the impacts of energy efficiency, its value
to electricity system operations is starting to be recognize in more markets. In the United States, energy
efficiency has begun to be allowed to compete as a resource in competitive wholesale electricity markets such
as capacity markets, competing directly against power generators for contracts to meet peak power needs.
These contracts face a constant criticism from regulators, however, that energy efficiency reductions can’t be
quantified in the same way power generation can. In some European countries, such as France, Italy, and
Poland, “white certificate” markets have operated, allowing utilities to trade the achievement of energy
efficiency policies. However, as program rules tighten to ensure savings are actually being achieved, programs
lacking data structures have difficulty maintaining a market position.
What can you do with real-time Measurement and Verification of efficiency?
● Enabling new markets: If you could create a trustworthy verification of efficiency, you could stimulate
new transactions and create entirely new markets for the electric grid, such as new demand response,
peak reduction, or grid balancing markets.
● Transparent Policy and Performance Measurement: Governments or utilities that invest in emissionreducing initiatives can enable the public to see, track, and analyze for themselves the efficacy of
different civic strategies.
● A Protocol of Protocols: By leveraging the data validation and attribute verification modules on the
Bluenote Protocol, other markets can create their own transactions on top of the Bluenote Protocol,
now with trust in the impact they are transacting.

UNLOCKING BUILDING ASSET VALUE
Reducing energy use can improve the IRR of building investments
Investors and lenders are bound by a fiduciary duty to make decisions which lead to greater profitability. When
they have the tools to demand buildings make energy efficiency upgrades because they make the assets more
profitable, we can change the fundamental business practice for an entire global industry.
In the US alone, the Rockefeller Foundation has estimated that $100B saved in electricity in buildings each year
would translate to roughly $600B - $800B in increased asset value, plus an additional estimated $279B spent
on actual efficiency upgrades11 12.
The new efficiency potential that can be unlocked by the Bluenote Protocol creates a new value proposition
for building asset owners. This value can be determined by using the traditional methodology called the
“Income Capitalization Method,” a standard technique used by commercial real estate investors around the
world to determine the value of a building asset. These are the important variables used in the “capitalization
rate” (or “cap rate”) formula:
1. Net Operating Income (NOI) where NOI = Operating Income - Operating Expenses
2. “Capitalization Rate”: is the ratio of net operating income (NOI) to a property’s value (NOI ÷ Value =
Cap Rate). A building with an annual NOI of $1,000,000 which was purchased $10,000,000 would have
a cap rate of 10%.
3. Valuation: the formula expressed to determine the value of an asset is (NOI ÷ Cap Rate = Value). A
building with an NOI $1,000,000 and a cap rate of 10% (as determined by local market averages for
similar buildings) would have a value of $10,000,000.
Assuming that all other market conditions are equal, we see that increasing NOI is how investors drive an
increase in building value, and this can be done through either by growing revenue or reducing expenses.
Why is energy important to building valuation?
According to the Building Owners and Managers Association’s 2016 Experience Exchange Report, a survey of
5,200 commercial buildings in the United States and Canada, Utility expenses account for an average of 26.7%
of total operating expenses. Using the income capitalization method, building managers able to reduce
operating expenses associated with utility or energy expenses can also increase the value of the whole asset.
 11https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/report/united-states-building-energy-efficiency-retrofits/
12 Uses the income capitalization method, assuming that $100B in lower aggregate market expenditures will results in $100B in equivalent
increased aggregate NOI, and uses a CAP rate of 6%-8% for the calculation.

INTRODUCING THE BLUENOTE PROTOCOL
Background
We set out to create a protocol that leverages the benefits of the blockchain ecosystem to provide an open
access, decentralized, transparent, confidential, and value-focused data ecosystem that will open up a new
energy efficiency data market, prove the measurement and verification of solutions, and ultimately unlock
new building asset value.
There is a fundamental shift emerging in how buildings are generating, collecting, analyzing and acting on their
data. As the Internet of Things revolution expands, bringing with it amounts of new data orders of magnitude
larger than exist today, buildings should be able to:
● use that data to understand how they are and should be managing their building minute by minute
● identify outlier events and conditions
● understand what measures would make their building more efficient
● respond to grid needs and participate in grid markets
● track their performance against themselves or their peers, and
● prove how these investments not only lower operating costs but increase a building’s value.
Yet, the energy services industry has pushed buildings to adopt proprietary analytics hardware and software,
tying their customers to their own ecosystem and trapping data. This happens because building technology
companies readily admit that their primary focus is to sell hardware, and often see software services simply as
a means to sell even more hardware to a building. The result of this siloed approach means, today, even the
“smartest” buildings are limited to a data universe of their own building, and whatever model their vendor
offers. They can’t compare and contrast energy savings investments because they don’t have the time or skills
to conduct advanced modeling on their own, and they can’t track the performance of similar efforts in similar
buildings. They are stuck at the mercy of their vendor, a relationship that has become fraught with distrust.
The Bluenote Protocol changes that. It provides an alternative to keeping data locked in vendor silos, and
allows for the easy sharing the intelligence exposed by data across a decentralized network, opening up new
opportunities for energy efficiency that are not otherwise possible.

Protocol Overview
The Bluenote Protocol is a decentralized network of building data, paired with a token-based
system for data processing and decision making software services. The Bluenote Protocol does
not act as a data gatekeeper or central hub, but rather as a collaboration enabler.
The protocol is developed as a series of Nodes, packaged data services connected through the network and
recorded on the common ledger. Each node allows data to be pulled in standard formats from buildings into
separate data streams, each one accessible with permission by the broader network without jeopardizing
confidentiality of the building.
By pulling its data out of its silos, uploading it to a node, and connecting it to the network, a building will be
able to easily contract for energy efficiency services, data services, analytics services, or verification services
through a marketplace of software modules. These software modules could provide building-specific products,
as simple as a benchmarking analysis to as complicated as a continuous-commissioning analytics engine, just
by being directed to the location of a building’s data stream.
The software modules can also leverage the wisdom of the enormous dataset connected to the network,
scouring confidential and anonymous building data to identify trends, characteristics, or performance of
similar buildings and desired technologies. Buildings will use Bluenote tokens, and associated smart contracts,
to procure those modules, and receive the output data stream for use in their dashboard or building energy
management systems.
The more data that is connected to the Bluenote Protocol, the greater the insights that can be gained from the
entire network of data by third-party application developers. As third-party modules search for and use
anonymous building data, any buildings whose data was used gets a small commission, generating additional
token revenue over time for participants.
Utilities, Regulatory Bodies, and Lenders that are requiring certain energy efficiency performance of a building
can easily access data streams from participants, reducing or eliminating the need for separate engineering
studies, audits, or evaluation regimes that can take months to complete. With the Bluenote Protocol, these
interested parties could simply execute software applications, called Attribute Modules, that calculate the
energy, environmental, or financial impact of a building, producing an output data stream that is recorded on
the blockchain common ledger and auditable back to its source data.

Core Principles
The Bluenote Protocol will be a trusted decentralized foundation for the recording, calculation, exchanging and
verification of the impact of energy efficiency in buildings. The Bluenote Protocol is built on five core
principles:
● Open Access: Any project can upload data and gain access to the Bluenote Protocol and its ecosystem.
● Decentralized: The Bluenote Protocol is a method of categorizing and trading data among a
decentralized network of nodes, not a single relational database or centralized server.
● Transparent: All shared data streams connected to the protocol are accessible to all apps to be used,
along with any transactions or uses of that data.
● Confidential: To maintain confidentiality, all data streams are identified by a unique key that is known
only to the owner and anyone they share it with.
● Data has value: Participants can be rewarded with bluenotes simply for uploading useful data to the
protocol, with the amount of rewards dependent on the type, quality, frequency, and demand for
that data.
Open up the Data
Open Access. With the Bluenote Protocol, a building establishes its own data streams of static, historical, or
real-time data on a node it has control over. The building can choose, on its own or in coordination with an
energy services company, what data is uploaded, what quality of data is shared, and how to map the data
streams to its three-dimensional structure.
Decentralized. The building’s data is not trapped in a single vendor’s own database. Instead, it is part of a
network that is connected to all the other nodes. This decentralized organization allows for a building to easily
pick and choose how it wants to use the data. Even when it allows for the sharing of that data, or to purchase
analytics based on that data, the building can keep the data on their own node. For example, if it wishes to use
analytics services from a third-party module provider, it simply shares its data stream reference ID with the
service provider.. The data stays on the building’s own node but authorizes access to its data streams to the
module provider. Similarly, if a building wishes to use a module to calculate a particular attribute, such as
verified energy savings, in order to participate in a utility energy efficiency program or a certificate trading
program, it simply uses the Bluenote protocol for that verification from the attribute module provider, while
keeping its data on its own node.

Transparent. All data stream locations, as well as transactions, are recorded in the blockchain ledger, but no
data is transferred away from any node and stored elsewhere. Further, data stream records on the chain
would be recorded with a unique hash code in order to maintain data integrity over time. As the Bluenote
Protocol is used to prove measurement and verification of the impact of energy efficiency investments on
performance and finances in buildings, it is important for the community to know that data has not been
tampered with. As buildings use attribute modules to prove the verified impacts of their efforts, this
transparency also allows for a permanent accounting of verified attributes. Being able to forever track data
back to its source ensures an auditable record of energy efficiency performance that does not exist in any
other form today.
Confidential. A building can choose to disclose how much or how little of its data is exposed to the community
as a whole, and even to the module provider. By establishing separate data streams, a building can distinguish,
for example, the raw real-time electricity data it uploads in one stream, while including any personally
identifiable information in a separate stream with its own unique key. When purchasing analytics services, the
building would provide the unique IDs of all necessary data streams to the module provider in order to gain
necessary insights and results, but otherwise the protocol as a whole would have no way to relate the two
distinct data streams.
Data has value. While a building may choose to make all of its data confidential, the Bluenote Protocol will
strive to create a herd effect, incentivizing buildings to share identifiable and non-identifiable data streams
with the broader community in order to enable recommendations module providers to have a strong data set
from which to use. In order to incentivize data sharing, buildings will be provided with Bluenote token rewards
as they seed a market segment, with greater rewards depending on data quality, frequency, rarity, and
value/demand.

BLUENOTE PROTOCOL: GETTING THE DATA
The success of the Bluenote Protocol is dependent on the quantity and quality of data it can pull out of
buildings and into distributed nodes to be part of the network. A few opportunities exist to get data out of
vendor siloes today and into a distributed platform, and new opportunities are beginning to emerge with the
growth of IoT technology in buildings. The number of buildings and the volume of data that is connected to the
Protocol will depend on the ease through which the everyday building operator, or their designee, can
connect.
How do you get data out of buildings?
Existing hardware. Most medium to large commercial buildings have some form of digital hardware device in
their buildings, even if it is not the same piece. Most buildings built in the last 20 years have come with DDC
(Direct Digital Controls), and many commercial buildings have converted from pneumatic or other analog
controls in the past 10 years. Over the past 8 years, the deployment of “smart meters” (utility meters that
record interval usage digitally as opposed to gross usage on a dial) has reached significant scale, with a recent
Navigant report projecting that smart meter deployment will grow from 30% at the end of 2016 to 53% by
2025.14 A smaller percentage of large buildings have installed their own sub-metering, either as an efficiency
strategy, billing strategy, or to participate in demand response.
● Utility Smart Metering. The major revolution in the deployment of smart meters is the granularity of
data moving from monthly, to sub-hourly. The Bluenote team has worked with utility metering
vendors, ZigBee technology partners, and pulse-reader data servers to pull that data from the utility
meters as frequently as every 6 seconds. Some solutions will require an additional piece of
inexpensive hardware as an intermediary (for example, a ZigBee communication device that transmits
meter data to a node), while new partnership may allow for direct connections.
● Sub-metering. Many buildings that have installed sub-metering to measure energy usage on multiple
electricity loads in a building are already well-equipped to configure that hardware to upload data
directly to a node. Sub-metering systems typically store data in a database of choice, and can be local
or off-site already today, depending on a building’s needs. The Bluenote team will work to integrate
standard data export formats so that the top systems on the market can send directly to a Bluenote
node.
Existing Software. In some cases, a building has already installed a software platform on a local server, or in a
vendor’s cloud to aggregate and store the data collected from its systems. These could be the software
systems and associated controls that work with the digital controls to automate the buildings heating and
cooling needs, lighting, pumps, or air flow.

BLUENOTE.WORLD
DRAFT version 0.99.c. Content subject to change
The Bluenote team has already started working with software vendors to find solutions to pull this data onto a
distributed node. Many vendors that have a primary interest in selling the digital control hardware are
motivated to find ways to make their hardware and software more useful to buildings, so they can sell more.
● Building Automation Systems servers. Getting data out of a Building Automation System is more
difficult than accessing utility metering data. Building Automation Systems typically involve servers
with proprietary interfaces, and a back-end database (or databases) that store records of events in a
chronological fashion. This is because Automation systems typically are used for command and
control (output), not input. The Bluenote team will be working with the leading Building Automation
System vendors to integrate APIs into the servers that allow for the one-way flow of data to a
Bluenote node.
● Building Energy Management Systems. In contrast to Building Automation Systems, Building Energy
Management Systems are actually designed to give input and feedback to a building operator. These
systems are typically built on a more accessible database structure, making API development to a
Bluenote node easier.
● Financial Management Software. The Bluenote Protocol seeks to break down the barriers between
building operating data and financial data in order to draw a straight line from energy efficiency
improvements to increases in a building’s profit. Yet, there are no consistent software mechanisms
for financial data, with some larger ownership groups adopting software packages for multiple-owned
buildings, while some buildings still operate on spreadsheets. The Bluenote team will work to find the
simplest and most accessible financial information that can draw the needed insights.
Building Inputs. Not all data will come in the form of an existing real-time data stream. There are many
variables and data sources that have value to a building that are more static, descriptive, or infrequent. The
Bluenote team will gather this data by developing an easy-to-use front-end for data input as a prototype.
While other third-parties can develop their own, the Bluenote version will be seen as a model for what and
how data should be collected. The front-end will allow for easy and regular collecting of the following data,
and the connection of that data to individual data streams on a Bluenote node:
● One-time data/annual data. Basic building data such as geographic location, building envelope,
height, control systems, major mechanicals, contact information.
● Quarterly Data. Non-routine changes to basic info, such as tenant occupancy levels or major
investments.
● Monthly Data. Month-specific data, such as utility expenses, operating expenses, income, and other
variables.
New hardware. As the IoT market evolves, there will be an even greater penetration of hardware and data
service solutions that can serve the needs of the buildings and Bluenote. Bluenote will work with IoT hardware
developers to make their new sensors and data acquisition servers to be ready to be integrated into the
Bluenote Protocol at the option of the building. For hardware companies (such as those who want to sell
thermostats, occupancy sensors, air quality sensors, or distributed lighting control), making their devices ready
to participate in the Bluenote Protocol will allow them to focus on selling their core business - hardware -
rather than having to develop their own software services as well.

THE BLUENOTE TOKEN
The token used to implement the Bluenote Protocol is the Bluenote token. All transactions on the Protocol are
made through the Bluenote token. The token itself has value - a price reflective of market demand for services,
velocity of money in the market, market cap constraints, and the volume of transactions.
How do you get bluenotes?
You can receive bluenotes through one or all of the following methods:
● Uploading Data. By uploading and connecting data to the Bluenote Protocol, you will be rewarded
with Bluenote tokens based on the quality, frequency, and demand for the data you upload.
● Buying on an Exchange. You can exchange fiat currency for Bluenote tokens on a public exchange.
● Use of Your Data. Some types of modules scour raw data on the network to produce analytics for
similar building types.
What can you do with the Bluenote token?
The Bluenote token can be used in the Bluenote Protocol’s marketplace to purchase services and products
from Bluenote. You can also exchange the Bluenote token back into fiat currency on a public exchange.
BLUENOTE PROTOCOL: THE MARKET
1. Connects through existing systems like smart meters and building management systems, as well as
building financial systems
2. Verifies performance as to which specific technologies create the most value.
3. Data is linked to a distributed ledger, so it can be audited to its source and trusted by everyone. It
doesn’t go through the filter of existing proprietary systems which are designed to limit data access
and insight.
4. Participants are rewarded in Bluenote tokens for connecting their data to the protocol. Multiple
industries in the energy value-chain can benefit from using the data on Bluenote Protocol to prove
the value of business opportunities in real-time

RECOMMENDATIONS MODULES
Recommendations modules will be software analytics micro services that are developed by Bluenote using the
protocol to identify inefficient operations in buildings, provide recommendations to buildings on energy
efficiency strategies, calculate potential impact from different efficiency decisions, and conduct other insights
using individual building data, as well as the large body of building data in the Bluenote community.
Participants will pay for Recommendations Modules using the Bluenote token.
While it is possible for a third-party provider to develop a module for a building as a stand-alone product, it is
likely that the most impactful modules will be ones that leverage data from other buildings as the community
grows.
Individual buildings will be able to search for and choose third-party-developed recommendations modules to
provide building analytics that fit their needs and avoid the need to establish an exclusive relationship with
one provider or install new equipment for each vendor.
Typically, third-party building analytics service providers today require a dedicated set-up for data to be sent
from a building to their local server or cloud-based software, costing buildings thousands of dollars in up-front
proprietary hardware and on-site server costs, or limiting buildings to a single provider. With the Bluenote
Protocol, that building is already streaming data out of the building in a standardized format, reducing the
transaction costs for a building to look around for data analytics services.
ATTRIBUTE MODULES
Even the first mathematicians needed to learn to count to 1 before they could discover zero. To get to a zero
emission world, everybody needs to be able to understand what emissions we are creating and how, and
whether the actions we are taking to reduce our emissions are having the desired impact. If we are to create
markets and incentives to account for those reductions, we have to have the same confidence and proof with
what is being reduced as the electric meter has with what is being produced.
Typically, calculation of attributes in the energy sector, such as kilowatt-hour reduction or carbon emission
reductions, are done by consulting firms and researchers that conduct Measurement and Verification studies
to determine what was achieved by a building, a cumbersome process that can take months. Instead, an

Attribute Module in the Bluenote economy can run that analysis using the building’s own data in real time,
opening up new opportunities for participants and markets to value energy efficiency performance.
The Bluenote Protocol will be an open and transparent network, allowing participating buildings to upload
their raw performance data and receive a community-verified calculation of certain attributes of their
performance – such as verified reduction of kilowatt-hours in real time, carbon impact, or financial and social
impact – that is a permanent record that is traceable to its data source. The engines that run these analyses
are Attribute Modules and are paid for in Bluenote token.
It is possible for a third-party to develop an Attribute Module for a building as a stand-alone product, or it is
possible for a third-party to develop an Attribute Module that leverages data from other buildings as the
community grows.
In the Bluenote economy, those individual buildings seeking to prove their performance, or government- or
utility-run efficiency initiatives requiring pay-for-performance metrics, will be able to implement and use
Attribute Modules that fit their needs. The Attributes Modules will allow the buildings or third-parties to avoid
the need to establish an exclusive relationship with one evaluation provider or vendor.
These modules process large data sets and combine data from multiple streams on the protocol - such as data
from peer buildings, or weather data - to identify measurable results and document them as verified and
transparent Attributes. With all data living on the open protocol, any Attribute or value can be audited straight
back through to its source data, never under-counted or double-counted.
Variety of Module possibilities
An unlimited number of third-party module developers will be able to implement a range of module types,
from simple modifications to Bluenote-developed reference modules using the datastream programming
platform, all the way to advanced software suites.
The Bluenote community will focus on creating standardized data formats on the protocol for a variety of
inputs, inviting developers to take the lead to create products and modules designed for different stakeholders

and different needs. The Bluenote development team will be developing platform level solutions designed to
both facilitate the use and discovery of data streams, applications and services.
One of the essential features of Bluenote is to open up the possibility for app developers to integrate Energy
Efficiency data with financial data, to create new insights and markets related to the impact of energy
efficiency on asset value where is hasn’t been able to be associated before. The common feature is that all the
applications will be integrated on the network

HOW THE REWARD POOL WORKS
The Reward Pool will be established to seed the Bluenote Protocol with quality building data and to facilitate
data generation, uploads, and application deployment by third-parties, as a kickstart to the Bluenote token
economy. Early on, participants gain tokens based on the uploading and connecting certain types of data to
the protocol, with different token values based on the data type, quality, and frequency.
The number of tokens rewarded for data depends on uniqueness of that data, and its relative value to the
whole community. For example, the first building uploading its data will receive a larger token reward then the
1000th building of a similar type. In this way the participants who help create the foundational data set, for
either the whole economy (all data), or for an important sector of the economy (building financial data) get a
larger reward.
Virtuous cycle of data
Bluenote creates a virtuous cycle for developers and data providers, allowing for buildings to anonymously
share their data with the community as a whole, This distributed system avoids the need for start-up module
developers to procure large building datasets separately. The freedom from having to procure data separately
lets the developer focus on its core analytical expertise, while rewarding data based on its value incentivizes
more sharing of higher quality data.

BLUENOTE PROTOCOL: THE TECHNOLOGY
Traditional data platforms centralize data in the hands of a single firm, controlling the market
and locking-in participants. Bluenote’s platform enables product development but does not act
as a data gatekeeper. Instead, data is managed by a decentralized network of nodes: the
Bluenote Protocol. Openness, trust and a fair market for data are necessary to incentivize the
beneficial sharing of confidential data such as energy usage, occupancy and financials.
The protocol runs on a network of Nodes, packaged services connected through the network and maintaining
a common ledger. Each node participates in a distributed file system, with a defined set of standard data
formats and establishes a unified access architecture, called a slab hierarchy, for data streams from associated
buildings.
On top of the protocol and supported by the platform layer, a number of software modules operate,
developed by both Bluenote and third parties. Buildings use Bluenote tokens, and associated smart contract.
Nodes
A node provides a number of services packaged into an easily installable unit. Each node provides data
acquisition and storage, processing capacity using a dataflow programming language, a building database
including a geometric hierarchy locating data sources, a web front end to access the service, APIs for
uploaders, downloaders and custom modules.
Decentralization goes beyond the nodes into the building blocks themselves. Building geometrical description,
data streams, data stream uploaders, processing instances, processing module classes and smart contracts are
all accessed through a b-link regardless of the actual node it is stored or executed on. 
WHITEPAPER

BLUENOTE.WORLD
DRAFT version 0.99.c. Content subject to change
Data
Building energy, operations and financial data come from a wide variety of sources and in a wide variety of
formats. The protocol aims at four main goals:
● Distributing data to enable both scaling and confidentiality,
● Formatting this information in order to integrate existing sources while being designed to support the
growing flow of new real time sources (IoT),
● Structuring the information in a geographical/geometric way that is logical and unambiguous,
● Associating data with smart contracts to completely decentralize the trading and ensure trust through
the blockchain.
Bluenote’s protocol is defined by four basic elements relating to the structure and content of the community
created repository of building data.
Distributed file system. A single distributed file system tree is structured following a geographical and
geometrical approach.
Slab hierarchy. At every node, a number of subdirectories contain data streams related to this particular 3D
volume (a slab).
Data stream. Each standardized data stream device can be the product of real-world measurement, financial
information or the product of a computation called an attribute.
Smart contract. Along the data stream comes a smart contract describing how to access it using Bluenote
tokens.
Node Container. The technological stack for the establishment of a node on the Bluenote Protocol will be
provided as a container, and will include a variety of widely supported open source solutions (IPFS, InfluxDB,
Docker) to enable the functionality.

Application Layer
On top of this very simple distributed protocol, a number of decentralized applications are deployed to
organize, manage and add value to the data being shared. These fall into 2 categories: platform and product.
Platform
The platform enables product development. It handles
data source identification, access control and discovery
using semantics (metadata), 3D localization and content
search. The platform manages the microservices but does
not aggregate or store data itself.
Products
Products are the Bluenote-developed Recommendation
Modules and Attribute Modules. Bluenote provides a
standardized library and framework to process data
streams into attributes and/or recommendation.

HOW BUILDINGS PARTICIPATE IN THE REAL WORLD
To understand how the Bluenote Protocol and different modules will work in the real-world, we describe the
journey of a building that will participate in the Bluenote Protocol. We will call this building the Johnson
Building, a mid-rise office building of 37,000 sq. meters (400,000 sq. ft) that uses electricity for both cooling
and heating.
Uploading Data and Establishing a Node
The Building first engages with the Bluenote Protocol by establishing its own data streams on its own node to
connect with the network. In this case, it is being helped by an energy services company that specializes in the
Bluenote Protocol. The building first:
1. Creates a node for a distributed software package on its own cloud server or uses the
already-established node of its energy services company.
2. Uses a simple web interface product to upload static building information such as size,
location, floor plate, building envelope, major mechanicals, and other data.
3. Connects Bluenote-compatible hardware devices with its utility electricity meter and
building automation system to provide a direct data upload of its real-time data to a data
stream.
4. Chooses to make a further small investment to install sensors to collect temperature, air
quality, occupancy, and daylight data throughout its building, and maps the data streams
to a 3D building model.
Rewards for Data
Participants gain tokens based on the uploading and connecting certain types of data to the protocol, with
different token values based on the data type, quality, and frequency. In this scenario, the building chooses to
share all of its data streams to be used by the data community. It receives the most tokens for its real-time
data streams.
WHITEPAPER
44
BLUENOTE.WORLD
DRAFT version 0.99.c. Content subject to change
Confidentiality
The four streams of data that the building has established in the node and connected to the Bluenote Protocol
- static data, electric meter data, automation system data, and sensor data - are mapped as separate data
streams with their own unique identifier. The decision to combine those data streams together, creating
personally identifiable information, can only be made by the building by sharing the data stream keys for each
data stream and identifying them as connected.
Marketplace
The building connects to the Module Marketplace developed by Bluenote to search and compare
for building analytics software providers, review ratings and feedback.
Recommendations Module
The building decides to purchase two Recommendations Modules through the Marketplace.
First, it selects a Recommendations Module that provides the building with an hourly baseline based on its
historical electricity usage data, weather patterns, and occupancy patterns. It uses some of its reward tokens
for the purchase of this module. The building shares its historical data stream ID, its base building static data
stream ID for location data, and its occupancy data stream ID from its sensor data through the smart contract.
Once accepted, the third-party module uses those IDs to identify the data locations and run its analysis
module, with the output of the module becoming its own data stream with its own unique ID that is shared
back with the building.
WHITEPAPER
45
BLUENOTE.WORLD
DRAFT version 0.99.c. Content subject to change
The building wants to display the hourly baseline data stream from the module provider on a dashboard app,
so it can track its performance against the baseline in real time. It adds the data stream to its Bluenotepartnered dashboard simply by entering the baseline data stream ID into the dashboard interface. The building
will use this dashboard to display several pieces of relevant data to its building operators on a real time basis,
all pulled from various module outputs.
Now, the building wants to compare its energy intensity against substantially similar buildings. It visits the
Marketplace to search for a second Recommendations Module to do just that.
Attributes Module
The building has partnered with its local utility to enroll in a pay-for-performance energy efficiency program,
allowing the building to get paid on a cents-per-kilowatt hour basis for verified whole building energy
efficiency reductions.
As part of this program, the utility joins the Bluenote community and chooses an Attributes Module to
calculate the verified energy efficiency performance of the building. Because the building has real-time data
flowing in to the protocol, the utility is able to use an open source real-time measurement and verification
Attributes Module that it has reviewed and trusts, that calculates the building’s real time energy performance
vs. its modeled baseline to come up with an hourly kilowatt-hour saved metric.
The utility receives as an output a data stream ID of a verified energy efficiency savings metric that is
permanently traceable back to the source data of the building, avoiding the need to run a separate, offline,
third-party statistical analysis that does not have access to all the building’s data.

Major Upgrade to Reduce Operating Costs and Increase Building Value
The building is thoroughly enjoying its energy efficiency performance but knows it can do much more. It
decides to do a major energy efficiency retrofit with a goal of reducing its energy consumption by 20% and its
energy operating expenditures by 25%.
The building returns to the Marketplace and chooses a Recommendations Module for conducting retrofit RFPs.
In this module, the building provides its data stream IDs as part of a smart contract. Now, interested vendors
that wish to bid on the major retrofit project would access the RFP and the building’s data that is now all
sitting in one place in an easily processable format. They enter into their own smart contract to receive the
data stream IDs. and produce as an output back to the building their bid and estimated energy and costs
savings for each piece of the project, and the project as a whole.

USE CASES
To serve the needs of the building energy efficiency market, the Bluenote team will develop several distinct
Recommendations Modules and Attributes Modules to demonstrate the capabilities of the Bluenote Protocol.
The three use cases included here include some of the reference modules that will be developed with the
proceeds of the Bluenote token sale.
1.1 BUILDING ANALYTICS USE CASE
The Bluenote Protocol will allow participants to gain insights from its large body of building data, running
analytics to help individual building operators to identify best performing solutions and compare across the
universe of building data on the network. By gathering and aggregating building data from a large population
of buildings, Bluenote is creating new ways of looking at building performance and better understanding the
contribution of each subsystem or upgrade.
Recommendations Modules – Recommendations modules will be software microservices that live on the
platform and are paid for with Bluenote tokens. Recommendations modules would use as inputs both
individual and whole-market building-supplied data on building type, envelope, major equipment, lighting,
plug loads, specific energy efficiency measures, and operations.
Load Disaggregation Recommendation Module (R.2) Example
Using sub-metering data and machine-learning to identify individual electrical loads by the second-by-second
energy usage signature, allowing buildings to understand what building equipment is using energy when.

BLUENOTE.WORLD
DRAFT version 0.99.c. Content subject to change
1.2 BUILDING OPERATIONS USE CASE
The Bluenote Protocol will also allow for more transactional modules that can be tied in to government- or
utility-led energy efficiency incentive programs, allowing those programs to track verified energy savings or
carbon emission savings from the buildings completely within the protocol. A Building Operations Module will
demonstrate how a Recommendation Module can be combined with Attributes Modules to fill a gap in the
energy efficiency market today.
Many buildings have implemented real-time monitoring of electricity usage data, but they lack the ability to
interpret their real-time usage to know whether it is higher than it should be in any given moment, and why.
What they are left with is a meaningless number or gauge. A Real-Time Baseline module will be implemented
that will allow buildings to track their energy usage in real time as compared to a trusted and verifiable hourly
energy usage baseline. This baseline would be generated from their historical usage data stored on the
platform and use intelligence from substantially-similar buildings elsewhere on the platform.
The building would be able to then turn their performance against that baseline into attributes of verifiable
energy savings. Blue is working with local utilities and government energy efficiency program administrators in
certain geographies to allow for those attributes to be turned into performance-based incentives. They will be
able to prove the verified energy efficiency savings or carbon reduction attributes through the token-based
protocol, replacing the utility’s traditional measurement and verification (M&V) process.
Real-Time Baseline Recommendation Module (R.1) Example
A calculation of a building’s historical baseline of energy usage as a function of its historical usage on weathernormalized and occupancy-normalized days/hours. This baseline can be provided back to the building in real
time for use in dashboard or monitoring software.

of substantially similar buildings. The attribute would be calculated using operational data and static data to
drive the analysis.

1.3 WHOLE BUILDING RETROFIT USE CASE
One of the first use cases of the Bluenote will be verification of the financial and energy performance of
buildings that focus on energy efficiency strategies as value-enhancing investments. The goal of these building
pilots is to demonstrate that energy efficiency strategies can be capitalized into the building’s asset value
through a reduction in operating costs.
The buildings will upload data to the protocol to provide an open, transparent, and auditable data chain that
can be used to verify its achievement of those values. By sharing the data, the Bluenote retrofit buildings will
demonstrate to building owners, managers, and investors around the world replicable ways to improve the
financial performance of buildings through energy efficiency and emission reduction strategies.
Bluenote retrofit buildings will upload several streams of data to the protocol in different intervals:
● One-Time Data. Some data, like traditional real estate acquisition data, and static physical data
dealing with location, building construction, and height, would likely only need to be uploaded one
time as well as Annual Data,
● Some data would need to be uploaded each year, including major equipment installed,
● Monthly Data. Monthly data related to operating expenses, utility bills and rental income, would be
uploaded monthly,
● Hourly/Sub-Hourly Data. Building electricity data would be uploaded hourly or sub-hourly (by the
minute) to the platform, allowing for real-time monitoring and measurement of performance.
Attributes – To prove that a building is increasing its value by lowering operating costs, it will need to
demonstrate this through a series of verified metrics called Attributes. As a reminder, Attributes are outputs
from data analysis modules that use the data on the platform – supplied by the building and available from
other uploaders – to verify the results of the building’s activity to improve its energy usage. At a minimum, the
Bluenote’s retrofit pilot projects will produce the following Attributes:
● Verified Operating Costs Savings (A.4)
● Verified Change in Asset Value (A.2)

previous asset valuation. This is a traditional financial Commercial Real Estate financial model that uses
Bluenote’s energy modules to validate the source of OPEX cash flow change.

HOW DOES THE ECOSYSTEM SCALE?
The Bluenote economy requires, and will achieve, a large community of building participants. Getting buildings
to adopt the protocol and use the Bluenote token to purchases services will take significant effort through
multiple channels. The most direct channel - the building operators and managers themselves - is likely the
least interested in a token-based market. Building operators are often old-school, navigating the influx of data
in a building the way cautiously and skeptically. They will need help.
The main channels through which the Bluenote team will reach buildings include:
1. Direct to Buildings Operators and Engineers,
2. Leveraging building energy consulting and data service legwork,
3. Through Utilities and Governments pursuing data-centric energy efficiency programs,
4. In partnership with building ownership groups,
5. Embedded in building and IOT technology
The most likely people to help building operators upload data and connect to the Bluenote Protocol are other
actors in their market orbit: utilities, property owners, efficiency services companies, and building technology
hardware and software companies. History has proven that working through these adoption channels does not
provide linear scalability. Adoption is lumpy. For example, a property management group will likely decide to
implement the Bluenote Protocol and engage in the marketplace in one effort, after they have experience with
the Bluenote in a test building. Similarly, utility and government incentives and partnerships to achieve new
energy efficiency savings and to measure energy efficiency performance will be implemented region by region

BUILDING ADOPTION
In order to rapidly scale into the marketplace and drive building adoption, Bluenote will establish channel
partnerships that already play a role in the building life cycle. Because of the flexibility of the Bluenote
Protocol, we can approach the market from multiple complementary industries. The Bluenote team has deep
experience working in these markets and have long-established relationships with decision makers. While each
of these types of partners may have a slightly different incentive for adopting the Bluenote Protocol, in each
case success of the overall Bluenote Economy means individual success for the participating partner as well.
Potential partnership companies fall under two types:
Internal Controllers
Companies that have direct access to building equipment functions and performance. These companies are
responsible for the day-to-day operational success and management of the building.
1. Energy Service Companies
2. Building Management Companies and Engineers
3. Owner/Operators
External Influencers
Companies that do not participate in the day-to-day operations of the building, but have the ability to
influence day-to-day decisions, either through offering market-based and policy-based incentives or through
exerting fiduciary or financial control.
1. Developers
2. Real estate investors
3. Institutional lenders
4. Utilities
5. Government and energy regulators

INTEGRATING THE BLUENOTE PROTOCOL INTO
EXISTING TECHNOLOGY
Ultimately, the Bluenote Protocol will be best able to accelerate market adoption when partners that already
have existing equipment in buildings, and further sales channels in those buildings, agree to integrate the
Bluenote Protocol into their hardware and software. This integration will allow the Bluenote Protocol to reach
buildings with which it does not have a primary or secondary relationship and allow those hardware and
software vendors to provide new value-adding services to their current and prospective customers.
Software vendors
The Bluenote team is in discussion with several software-as-a-service energy and building information system
platforms to integrate the Bluenote Protocol into the software delivery function. The Bluenote team is
proposing not to replace these software companies as a provider of services to buildings, but rather get the
software providers to embed the Bluenote Protocol into their software’s data collection processes, with the
ultimate goal of establishing these software vendors as third-party applications in the Bluenote economy and
enabling easier access to their customer’s data.
Hardware vendors
The Bluenote team will be working with large and small hardware vendors that have a significant presence or
potential in the commercial building industry to integrate the Bluenote Protocol into their devices. Bluenote
will work to establish hardware partnerships in 2018 and, depending on the availability of funds, establish
hardware pilots in buildings to test the implementation of Bluenote Protocol-integrated devices.
● IOT Devices. Distributed Internet of Things devices often contain a data acquisition server on the site
of a building. The team will work with hardware vendors to allow for the data acquisition servers to
upload to their own established Bluenote Protocol nodes through the standardized data format.
When no server exists on-site, Bluenote will work with the IOT companies to make the Bluenote
Protocol node their cloud storage mechanism.
● Building Automation/Energy Systems (BAS/BEMS). Typically, Building Automation Systems and
Building Energy Management Systems are closed hardware servers that sit on the site of a building
and provider direct input and control to the building engineer. The team will work with the BAS/BEMS
companies to develop one-way real time export of their data records to a Bluenote Protocol node,
ensuring cybersecurity best practices that prevent data downloads or control of building control
systems.
● Meters and Submeters. With the recent mass deployment of intelligent metering systems by utilities
throughout the world, there presents new opportunities to collect interval metering data, and stream
in instantaneously, or with a short delay, to Bluenote nodes. The team will work with metering and
submetering companies to integrate firmware and software into metering systems that allow for the
direct transmission of meter data to Bluenote nodes.

GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS
Bluenote will focus on driving adoption in key cities that first and foremost exhibit strong real estate
fundamentals but are also coupled with relatively high energy prices and intense energy usage throughout the
year.
While we envision the Bluenote Protocol as a technology that can be deployed globally, from a practical point
of view, the team will initially focus on driving market adoption in cities that have strong technical
fundamentals where we also have pre-existing relationships. Bluenote will first target cities where we have
existing relationships with one or more “Internal controller” partners plus one or more “external influencer”
partners.
We will use those initial markets as a way to test and validate some of the best performing solutions and
demonstrate the benefit of the Bluenote Protocol. This initial success will not only drive organic market
adoption in the new cities but will also allow the team to leverage those initial successes to establish new
channel partnerships. Because channel partners touch different aspects of the commercial real estate industry,
showing how each channel can be effective will allow for additional and cities to adopt the method that best
fits the local environment.
The following cities have strong potential as initial locations. Bluenote team has strong pre-existing
relationships with potential partners, as well as strong fundamentals potential for building performance in
each of these cities.

LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF THE BLUENOTE
INFRASTRUCTURE
As the economy of the Bluenote ecosystem continues to grow over time, there are costs to maintain the
Bluenote Protocol infrastructure, which represent the significant scaling challenges of a nodal data system and
marketplace. The proceeds from the Bluenote token sale will support the continued initial development of the
Bluenote Protocol infrastructure, but ongoing expansion will need to be funded through a broad and low
transaction fee from the marketplace, plus revenue from Bluenote-produced modules.
Module Revenue
Products developed by the Bluenote team and market tools will not be the exclusive products in the module
marketplace. However, they will be priced nominally to provide ongoing support for the growth of the
Bluenote community and infrastructure.
Community Voting on New Investments
Bluenote token holder will be able to vote on Bluenote infrastructure development investments to direct
where these funds would go, including Node development, module prototype development, front-end
development, marketplace enhancements, and pilot projects.
