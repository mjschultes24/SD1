ARROUND is a decentralized augmented reality
(AR) platform with a mission to give anyone
the ability to experience the world in AR,
and provide a place for developers to realize
the potential of their applications .
ARROUND uses blockchain and augmented reality
to build an ecosystem consisting of four integrated
elements: a disruptive universal advertising network,
an augmented reality marketplace, a social platform,
and the next generation AR map that will create a backbone
for AR projects around the world .
The platform will release its own token, the ARR, to support
all transactions within the platform, with blockchain

Augmented reality (AR) is the integration of digital information with the user’s environment in real
time. Unlike virtual reality (VR), which creates a totally artificial environment, augmented reality uses
the existing environment and overlays new information on top of it.
While the technology to create an AR experience has been around for a long time, with the term first
being coined by Boeing researcher Thomas Caudellin in 1990, there have been many false starts
on the path to commercializing the technology. It is not until now, with the release of ARKit for iOS
and ARCore for Android, that the technology to reproduce an AR experience for consumers, initially via
smartphones, has been made possible.
“So far, we can see only the tip of the iceberg . In the future, augmented
reality will forever change the way we use technology”
— Tim Cook, CEO of Apple
Unlike AR, virtual reality (VR) completely replaces the vision of the real world. In order to enter virtual
reality, the user needs to wear a helmet and stay in a special room, while augmented reality is created
in the real world and complements it. In this sense, augmented reality is a mobile technology that can
be freely used to enhance existing real world activities, wherever they are.

Forecasts put the burgeoning AR market at $120 billion by 2020, growing to $198 billion by 2025,
showing a Combined Annual growth Rate of 65.1%. And while hardware sales are expected to make
up a large proportion of this revenue, AR data, AR commerce and AR advertising represent significant
chunks of this overall spend. The unprecedented growth and burgeoning popularity of augmented
reality make it one of the most exciting technologies in the world.
According to the analysts at Juniper Research and Goldman Sachs, the augmented reality market will
grow by 20-100 times in the next 5 years.

The market capitalization of some newly established companies in the field of AR/VR are already
in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Take Magic Leap, for example, the current market leader with
a capitalization of $6 billion.
Whilst Virtual Reality has garnered most of the headlines in recent years, the mobile nature
of AR means that it stands head and shoulders above VR in terms of forecasted mainstream adoption.

ARROUND fully recognizes the opportunities that this market offers and intends to utilize
the powerful combination of blockchain and augmented reality to:
•  Offer smartphone users (and later on users of smart glasses) a way to quickly create, share
and enjoy augmented reality experiences via a privacy focused social network.
•  Provide offline retailers, brands and organizations with a powerful new way to engage consumers
utilizing a variety of immersive and engaging advertising solutions based on augmented reality
technology .
•  Create a marketplace for AR developers globally and other entities to engage with the public
and monetize their applications, and provide them with a test environment via a robust SDK
and API in order to enable this.
•  Develop a crowd-sourced 3D spatial map of the world to provide an information backbone
to power the next generation of AR applications and services that require pinpoint accuracy
in a real world environment.

Generation Z — The New Breed of AR Users
Augmented reality will impact the majority of the world’s population and become an integral part
of our lives. Scientists at the University of Liverpool claim the whole generation born after 1995 -
Generation Z - will become the first augmented reality generation, for whom AR technology will be
as commonplace as smartphones and the Internet are for us today.
“Our fascination with augmented reality is just beginning . What we see
now is just a tiny part of what it will bring and what it can do”
— Dany Lopez, СOO of Blippar
Introducing Generation Z
This new generation of technology adopters will be the first to grow up with augmented reality
as their standard means of interfacing with the real world.

ARROUND is a unique decentralized economic and technological infrastructure supporting
the augmented reality ecosystem . Throughout each aspect of the platform, blockchain technology
is used in order to facilitate the development and sales of goods, services, information and advertising
using the principles of a decentralized economy. ARROUND will have the ability to address multiple
markets through the application of a single technological platform.
Each element of the ARROUND economy relies on blockchain to ensure frictionless interaction
between each party, allowing the system as a whole to maximize its potential to become
a transparent and trusted resource within the global AR ecosystem.
Blockchain is a digital ledger in which transactions are stored and validated by the participants
on the network, resulting in a unique transparent and verifiable record without the need for a central
authority. Through the use of EC20 smart contracts, ARROUND can solve a number of specific issues
associated with social networks, advertising networks, marketplaces and crowd-sourced data.

The public is hungry to create and share
AR experiences, but has few opportunities
to find quality content
The runaway success of projects such as Pokémon Go underscores the public’s desire to engage with
quality AR content as well as the willingness of business to adopt AR as a new kind of marketing
platform. However, this demand remains pent up, as the public has little opportunity to access quality
AR-focused content, let alone create their own AR experiences for their friends and peers.
To address this, we will launch AR Social, an augmented reality focused social network that puts users
in control of their AR experience. Users will have the ability to access AR applications, view, share
and even create their own AR content using their smartphone. The platform uses GPS and spatial
recognition technologies to provide a first class augmented reality experience, providing a unique way
to view the world around us.
A BRAND NEW SOCIAL EXPERIENCE
IN AUGMENTED REALITY .
Phase I of the platform (an MVP that will be available on both Android and iOS devices) will
provide users with the ability to view, interact with and share objects created by ARROUND and our
commercial partners. Later, we will develop the platform to provide additional functionality that will
give users the opportunity to play games, create and share content (videos, photos and messages) all
anchored to geo-spatial coordinates, allowing our users to fill the world with their own AR content
and content provided by commercial partners and 3rd party developers. The flexible structure
of the network means that it can be used to keep in touch with existing friends as well as build
a new circle of like-minded people. Users can create reviews, advertise their events, check in to places
and send messages, share their thoughts and feelings, sell items, go on virtual tours…in fact
the applications are only limited by the imagination of the users.
ARROUND will provide the infrastructure and offer motivation in the form of bounty programs
to rapidly grow the user base of the network, as well as implement cutting edge viral marketing
techniques to develop the reach of our network, in order to make it attractive, functional and the first
port of call for the public to join the augmented reality revolution.
Privacy on the network is guaranteed by a social contract written to blockchain, which secures
the users control of their identity and warrants that no 3rd party trackers are employed without their
consent. Any socio-demographic targeting is specifically undertaken with the consent of the user,
and even so, they retain the right to their anonymity on the platform. We believe that the use
of blockchain to protect the data of each and every user of our platform is an undeniable right,
and a departure from the free and easy approach to data security displayed by the current generation
of social networks.

Offline retailers have been left behind
in the data boom
Since the advent of the Internet, digital and mobile marketing have been the driving force
of e-commerce, and there is now an abundance of technology available for even the smallest online
retailer to take advantage of. However, in the race to provide ever more effective online advertising
and marketing methods, offline retailers have been largely ignored, forced either into a hybrid
model of offline/online sales or to offer untargeted discounts and offers via 3rd party sites online
in the hope that the customer will remember to visit their shops the next time they are on the high
street or in a shopping mall.
ARROUND’S DISRUPTIVE MOBILE
MARKETING SOLUTION IS THE WORLD’S
FIRST DECENTRALIZED ADVERTISING
NETWORK BASED IN AUGMENTED REALITY .
ARROUND is fully adopting the emerging technology of augmented reality to provide a decentralized
advertising solution for offline retailers that allows them to engage potential customers
in the process of shopping, through geo- and socio-targeted push notifications and in-store
augmented reality shopping assistance which can even generate discounts for clients while they are
selecting products to buy .
Through the activation of the AR Camera within the ARROUND application, consumers will be able
to point at specific products or objects in order to activate an AR experience. The AR Camera can be
trained to learn visual data in the form of packaging and logos so that when the camera recognizes
an item, it can provide additional information about it.
ARROUND can also recognize markers in the form of AR Codes (an analogue of QR codes)
to trigger an AR experience for the user. While QR codes provide a uniform experience for all users,
AR codes on ARROUND can offer a targeted experience for each individual user, based on their
socio-demographic data and the amount of personal information that they have chosen to share
on the platform. In this way, ARROUND gives offline retailers access to the same powerful tools that
online retailers have enjoyed for years. ARROUND will be an aggregator of AR experiences, so that
retailers no longer have to invest in their own application in order to provide an enhanced experience
for their customers and supporters.
In addition to tapping this vast reserve of unrealized advertising, ARROUND also provides a unique
platform for its users to communicate with each, create content and experience the world around
them through the lens of augmented reality. Both the advertisers and users are supported by 3rd
party developers who can leverage the powerful SDK and API to create new features, designs
and experiences for everyone on the platform via a marketplace.

The mobile advertising channel is saturated
Mobile advertising has rapidly become the most popular channel for digital advertising budgets.
Digital mobile spending has now surpassed TV ad spending, making it the single largest destination
for adverting dollars in the world, and the trend is expected to continue.
But with the high level of competition and huge supply of commercial offerings, users have become
weary of traditional advertising leading to the general consensus that new ideas are needed
to engage the public effectively.
AR provides a new and authentic way of engaging with people and spreading campaign messages,
be they commercial or social. Campaign images, animations and information are now free to leave
the confined surroundings of an Internet page, and literally take form in the real world. Through
the freely available technology now embedded in the vast majority of the world’s smartphones,
augmented reality represents the next huge opportunity for marketing and campaign managers.

ARROUND offers a combination of spatial recognition, AR codes and object recognition through
the AR Camera, coupled with the plug-and-play functionality that will be offered in the AR Store,
which will allow brands to quickly and easily bring packaging and marketing material to life, as well
as publish their campaigns (both static and animated) anywhere in the world. Because of ARROUND’s
social networking features, interesting and engaging messages will quickly travel throughout
the network, and across other large social media platforms as users begin to share them.
Integrating our AR AdNet onto the ARROUND platform means that all spending can be tracked,
overcoming a major hurdle for large advertisers.

Developers are searching for a ready-made
market for their AR creations
The advent of PC and platform gaming has created an industry dedicated to producing 3D animated
objects, and a legion of talented developers who are ready to produce and adapt existing content
for AR. Apart from market fragmentation, one of the leading reasons preventing this industry from
accelerating is the lack of a secure marketplace for these developers to securely sell or lease their
content .
Through the introduction of AR Store, ARROUND will provide a trusted market place, governed
by blockchain, where developers can register and publish their content, and where the platform’s
users can find an array of interesting and engaging content to enhance their AR experience.
AR STORE IS THE KEY LINK
BETWEEN THE USERS OF AR SOCIAL
AND THE CLIENTS OF AR ADNET .
Through the store, users will be able to access unique content to place in the real world, purchase
rights for advertising real estate on the ARROUND platform that they can use (and even sub-let
to other users or commercial parties), purchase or access additional AR applications such as virtual
guides and games.
Developers will be able to use the ARROUND test environment to ensure functionality
and compatibility, therefore minimizing costs and maximizing their profitability.
As well as creating experiences for users of the social network, the developers will be in demand from
the clients of AR AdNet, helping to bring the great ideas of our clients to life through building best
in class AR experiences for them.
Developing the next generation
AR Backbone
Since the introduction of motion tracking technology, AR devices are already able to understand
a user’s location and orientation when moving in a 3D plane. Area Learning algorithms use visual cues,
allowing the device to recognize the location and correct its movement. Depth perception sensors
can inform the user about the forms of the surrounding world and build virtual interaction processes
based on a cloud of points .
However, the creation of an immersive and captivating augmented reality experience depends
upon the quality of data available for its exposition. Most consumer grade augmented reality
apps rely on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) Technology, which generates
a map of the environment in real time, allowing augmented reality objects to be placed around
the environment. However, crucial to providing a uniform experience for other users within the same
15




environment is the ability to have an accurate map of the location with all the data points already
stored in a database. Sometimes called the AR Cloud, this dataset is at the core of the augmented
reality experience .
Objects can be placed in augmented reality via a number of methods, typically GPS data is used
initially to determine a geographic location, with SLAM providing an additional dater layer to more
accurately place the augmented reality object. Development tools such as Google’s ARCore and Apple’s
ARKit provide a level of sophistication that works well for single user AR experiences, but falls short
for multi-user experiences.
Using crowd-sourcing, motivated by bounties for mapping popular locations, ARROUND will develop
the next generation spatial map through integrating SLAM data into a 3D spatial map that allows
for the accurate placement of AR objects and data not only outdoors, but, importantly, indoors too.
This will allow for a beacon-free augmented reality experience in any location, be it a restaurant, club,
shopping mall, retail outlet, cinema, museum, university lecture hall, hotel or even around the home -
in fact anywhere where we have a set of points in order to anchor the augmented reality experience.

3D spatial maps represent an important new type of digital asset that have an array
of uses within the realm of augmented reality, as well as applications in industries such
as robotics, drone delivery and autonomous vehicles .
The ability to overlay any existing SLAM data, or equivalent, provided by the current set of SDKs
provided by Apple and Google, will result in our ability to provide pinpoint accuracy in presenting
an augmented reality experience exactly where our users require. This will support our AR Advertising
network, through being able to offer in-store navigation to a specific product within a shop. Once
the product is located via AR Camera recognition, then a new series of augmented reality functions
can be triggered, such as a display of additional information about the product depending upon
the nature of the object and the person viewing it. For example, if the product is a health food,
advertisers can present information about its origin (where it was produced, the ecology and so on),
the production process, the health benefits, and, of course, offer a discount to users in the form of ARR
tokens or a straight percentage from the listed price upon checkout.
In addition to enabling the advanced AR experience on ARROUND, the AR Map data that we collect
will also be analyzed to determine prime advertising locations, in order to develop optimum
marketing and advertising strategies by time and location correlated to user activity. An important
feature of this concept is that it integrates into our AR AdNet, therefore allowing ARROUND
to integrate our advertising network onto any digital platform able to offer an AR experience, adding
even more value to the platform and increasing demand for the ARR token.

A further feature of AR Map will be its portability. ARROUND will have the option to lease map
data to 3rd parties, for example other AR applications that require the same high level of accuracy
and access to spatial marketing data in order to monetize their property. In this way, ARROUND
can provide not only the map data itself, but also provide a commercial backbone for the booming
augmented reality market.
Through the development and commercial exploitation of AR Map, we believe that this data can
become a significant source of demand for the ARR token.

Users who opt-in to take part in mapping the world will receive a bounty in the form of tokens
for participation, and also own a part of the map to which they helped contribute, warranted
by blockchain. In return, a portion of the ARR received from usage of the map will be paid
to the owner in accordance with their rights, as secured by blockchain. Since ARROUND is primarily
concerned with interior maps in highly frequented locations, we will continually sample data in order
to keep the AR Map fresh and accurate.
Overall System Architecture
The ARROUND platform comprises four key elements that are all connected via blockchain, which
combine to create a complete AR ecosystem that will allow the project to thrive.

19




AR Social
This is ARROUND’s social network, which will be available for both Android and iOS and available
for free in Google Play and Apple’s App Store. The core concept of the network is to bring augmented
reality into a social setting, allowing every user to create and share AR content with their friends,
while making new friends in the process.
Users will be able to create Rounds, AR objects that can contain a variety of media types, and place
them in physical locations. Other users can interact with these Rounds using typical social actions,
such a liking, sharing and responding to them. AR Social integrates into the rest of the social
networking space via open APIs, meaning that content on ARROUND can be shared to YouTube,
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp as well as by email.
A selection of AR objects will be offered to users on the ARROUND platform by default. Customization
and additional AR objects will be provided by developers and by commercial partners. These
additional AR experiences will be accessible through the AR Store, which will be a key feature
of the AR Social application.
20




Users will be provided with an instant messenger in order to contact each other, and importantly, all
users will have a crypto wallet built into their profile to store their ARR and convert fiat and other
crypto currency into ARR. It is envisaged at this stage that ARROUND will adopt an existing solution
provided by a wallet provider rather than develop our own solution.
User Rounds will follow the example set by Snap Chat, in that they vanish after a certain time
in order to keep the content on the network fresh and relevant. Algorithms built into the system will
determine the time that each round stays alive based on the volume of activity in a specific location.
The more activity in a specific location, the faster the rounds will vanish. Users will have the ability
to promote their Rounds to others in order to gain views, and to extend the time their Rounds are
displayed. These basic features will be paid for in ARR tokens.
As the network grows, we will introduce further features such as a dating along with quests, treasure
hunts and games. Moderation of the network will be undertaken in the first instance via automated
computer processing, with post-moderation undertaken reactively to user requests.
As augmented reality is inherently a geo-location based technology, our focus will be on connecting
communities of interest by location, beginning in the world’s capitals.
AR AdNet
AR AdNet is another of the four key elements of the universal augmented reality ecosystem being
created by ARROUND. The idea behind the service is to provide an outlet for brands, organizations
and offline retail stores to engage in advertising, marketing and information campaigns in augmented
reality .
Each time we click a link on our mobile browser, our data is sent half way round the world, virtually
at the speed of light so that by the time the page loads, there is a relevant, contextual, targeted
advertisement waiting to greet us. Whether we like this or not, it is one of the most efficient
and profitable business models in history.
But ironically, the closer we actually are to the physical point of sale in the real world, the less mobile
advertising is employed, with retail outlets forced to rely on ideas and methods that they have used
for centuries-shop window displays and static billboards. Even more concerning, offline retail still
makes up the majority of all our purchases by a considerable margin, with almost 80% of all sales still
made via traditional offline shopping channels.
ARROUND fixes this broken and asymmetric model of user engagement, by offering a disruptive
advertising solution that unleashes the power of contextual advertising to high street retailers using
augmented reality (AR) accessible through smartphones or AR glasses, based on a platform powered
by blockchain.
Through the application of augmented reality and blockchain, ARROUND’s powerful advertising
solution brings offline retailers firmly into the 21st century, enabling them to actively target
new clients based on their geo-location, offer unique discounts and offers based on the client’s
socio-demographic characteristics and offer in store shopping assistance - all in a single app.
21




ARROUND’s augmented reality Ad Net provides a new avenue for offline retailers to define their
customer’s in-store experience, and allows them to make data-driven decisions during the shopping
process .
All commercial parties can access the ARROUND ecosystem via a dedicated Ad Portal. This
portal serves an important function in terms of allowing anyone to build and rollout advertising
or marketing campaigns from a single location.
The portal will provide the following functionality:
•  Registration as an advertiser. Advertiser can be either an individual or a legal entity
•  Advertiser’s account
•  Advertising round creation
•  Advertising campaign management
•  Reports and analytics
• Tariff plan selection and purchase
•  Advertising round creator toolkit
•  Client account
• Tools to top-up the user’s balance
•  Advertising campaign analytics
ARROUND can offer in-store navigation and targeted discounts for consumers
2




Reports from the web portal will be generated based on user events written to the blockchain,
to provide a unique and transparent record of all advertising spend and subsequent ROI.
The portal will be available for clients and agencies to manage individual as well as complex
multi-site advertising campaigns.
AR Ad Net also links directly to the AR Map, as complex product navigation campaigns will rely
on a detailed map of the environment in which they will take place. The map data will be provided
users from the social network, incentivized by crypto-rewards.
Advertising inventory is stored on the blockchain, to avoid double booking, to ensure transparency
in results and therefore provide actionable recommendations that can be trusted.
Third party developers are able to offer advertisers and users a host of services, enhanced features
and designs on the ARROUND platform. All purchases or leases of intellectual property created
by developers are governed by smart contracts, thus extending the level of trust that all parties have
in the platform.
PRINCIPLES OF INTERACTION
•  Pointing mobile device camera at a round for 1 second is equal to 1 view
•  When the user opens a round it will be equal to one click
•  Following a link contained in a round is equal to an Action (CPA)
The ARROUND platform will also hold promotions to encourage users to make purchases.
AR Map
The AR Map links directly to the social network and to the advertising solution. Users of AR Social
can take part in a project to map their location simply by scanning the area around them with their
smartphone camera. The requirement is only that they have a front facing camera in order to capture
a set of data points that will be generated. The technology is similar in nature to 3D scanning, a field
which already has a well-developed and widespread set of algorithms that can provide the accuracy
required to delivery an immersive AR experience. The resulting data set is a 3D point cloud, tagged
to a physical location determined by the GPS, and by additional information such as check-in status
and locations known to us.

Advertising Use cases
SOLUTION #1: PHARMACIES
Problem description
Typically retail stores try to arrange their window displays in order to attract customers and sell
more products. This is a method that dates back to the 18th Century. However, there is an inherent
disconnect in the fact that the user may be unable to easily locate the product once they are actually
in the store and additionally the product being promoted may be of no interest to the individual
consumer passing by the shop window. A further problem is that the user has to actually be physically
looking into the shop window to view the promotion. Subsequently, the conversion rate of such
merchandizing is usually quite low.
Proposed solution
ARROUND will allow retail business owners to integrate interactive advertising by means of AR codes
and via actual product recognition an in-store location.
AR codes
An AR code is equivalent to a QR code. The retailer places a special branded AR code in their window
display. The appearance of the AR code is a clue for the user to read it via the AR Camera on their
ARROUND app. When the AR Camera recognizes the AR Code.
The application will display unique content for each user depending on their socio-demographic data
or search queries.
For example, a young mother may see an ad for children’s vitamins or diapers (depending on the age
of her kids), while a middle-aged man who recently searched online for how to get rid of a cold will
see information about medicine to treat his cold products.
The concept of permission-based targeting means the consumer will often be presented with more
relevant options, helping to reduce the amount of time they spend shopping and therefore increase
their available leisure time.
Retailers will be able to use a virtual AR promoter and interact with customers inside the store
by offering them products that match their user profile, as well as communicate with customers
through AR to help them make a choice or ask them to leave feedback on social media.
Through further integration of ARROUND, AR technologies such as the AR Map and object recognition
features, with the combination of socio-demographic targeting and geo-location, the platform can
even provide push notifications to users who are near a pharmacy, notifying them about special
promotions that they may be interested in.
If the user is interested in the promotion, they will be able to receive step-by-step navigation
to the store and even navigation to the aisle and shelf where their desired product is located.
The AR Camera within the ARROUND application can recognize the item on promotion and provide
additional information in order to enhance the sales process, this includes the option of offering
personalized discounts on related products in order to increase the overall transaction amount.
24




SOLUTION # 2: NAVIGATION INSIDE SHOPPING MALLS
Problem description
Most shopping malls set high prices for navigation, advertising and promotional work. To solve
the problem of the lack of advertising space while maintaining the design of a shopping mall,
navigation and advertising can be organized in augmented reality.
Proposed solution
To activate the ARROUND space of a shopping mall in the form of navigation and information signs
or in the form of advertising and promo offers of tenants and brands according to each user profile
and utilizing Big Data.
A shopping mall interested in attracting potential customers can place ads in ARROUND over the mall
and send push-notifications to everyone in the shopping mall or in the accessibility radius. It is also
possible to organize/simulate advertising placement from tenants and major brands (for example,
Coca-Cola, P&G, Unilever, L’Oreal). When approaching a shopping mall, the user will see ads
and special offers which matches his or her own wants and needs.
Inside a shopping mall, through the use of ARROUND’s 3D crowd-sourced map, it’s possible
to organize navigation layers for product categories and for individual stores. Relevant offers
and virtual promoters and assistants offering coupons and bonuses can be placed on the customer’s
way around a shopping mall.
A shopping mall can also organize quests for shopaholics on the ARROUND platform. For example,
“chasing final discounts”, or “assign your own discount”, or “make 20 posts - get 20% off”.
The 3D point data generated by an individual user is processed, where it is compared to data that
ARROUND already has about the location. Area learning algorithms are applied to extract surface
details, so that anchor points can be generated within the location without the need for special
markers, and that these anchor points will be identical for all users, regardless of their position within
the location and without having to set up a unique shared session with other users at the location.
In order to motivate users to scan a location, ARROUND will set standard bounties at locations where
map data is required. Users can collect these bounties by scanning the location. Bounties will be
in the form of ARR tokens that will be paid into the system wallets of the ARROUND users. The size
of the bounty will be determined algorithmically depending upon the importance of the location
to the ARROUND platform. It is currently proposed to write the ownership of the AR Map into
blockchain in order to further incentivize our userbase to build out the map at an accelerated pace.
Such ownership would entail the ARROUND userbase owning a maximum of 40% of the overall map,
with ARROUND owning the remaining 60%. Revenue from easing and commercial activities associated
with the map would therefore be split with all owners of the map. IN this way, users who provide work
more to create the map receive a larger share of any future profits from their efforts.
While the standard tools provided by the Android and iOS AR development kits (ARCore and ARKit
respectively) provide for real time area localization, the accuracy that they can deliver in terms
of offering a shared AR experience can be improve upon. Through the creation of our own AR Map,
ARROUND can add an additional layer of accuracy onto our AR experience to provide the accuracy
to develop advanced social and commercial solutions that allow multiple users to be able to engage
with AR objects that appear in the same fixed spatial position relative to each user.
25




In the first stage, we propose applying this technology to our AR AdNet system in shopping malls
in order to enable step-by-step navigation to individual products located in retail stores that match
our users’ preferences. We consider this a breakthrough advertising technology of considerable
commercial interest to our existing partners, and also in high demand for future partners.
We will also apply this technology to AR Social, so that users in public spaces, be it bars, clubs, schools
or universities, can create AR objects (Rounds - messages, videos, images) tied to a fixed physical
location that appear the same to all users who view them through ARROUND’s AR Camera. This will
greatly improve the functionality of the existing AR experience, and will allow users to interact in new
and exciting ways, creating the first truly interactive multi-user consumer AR environment.
Through the development of our AR Map service, ARROUND will be well positioned to offer AR AdNet
as a monetization source to other mobile applications, with a goal of becoming the leading
augmented reality advertising network.
AR Store
The AR Store will allow users to conduct the sale and lease transactions of content and services
offered on the platform. Content authors will set the prices for their products themselves. It can
be free distribution, a freemium model or a one-time/regular payment. Also, there are options
for auctions, crowdfunding campaigns and donations.
Third party developers access the store via a development suite, allowing them to test not only
software but also test how their hardware interfaces onto the network. Through a powerful SDK
and API, ARROUND will be open to all parties who wish to develop the network.
All transactions within the AR Store are priced in fiat, but are undertaken in ARR. When a developer
creates an account in the AR Store, they will also be provided with a wallet in which to receive their
tokens. Tokens can be freely transferable at an exchange after the Main Token Sale.
The AR Store provides developers access to:
•  SDK - a ready-made software solution that will accelerate the development of AR content.
•  API - a set of ready-made parameters provided by the application to be implemented in external
software products, which will allow third-party developers to integrate their applications into our
system and monetize them.
• The distributed storage where the platform’s content will be stored.
•  Emulator - a section where developers can test their content for compatibility with various types
of devices.

ARROUND’s unique augmented reality ecosystem has already attracted the attention of a diverse
range of commercial partners, including a number of global brands. In the first case, these partners
will allow ARROUND to commercialize its offering, allowing the company to fine tune its strategy
while at the same time generating revenue.
Prominent among our initial partner base is the pharmaceutical chain 36.6 (partly owned
by Walgreens Boots Alliance), which operates over 2,000 physical locations and offers ARROUND
the opportunity to implement its unique in-store location marketing solution.
In addition to an established partner base, ARROUND has been engaged by companies including
Coca-Cola, Scania and Unilever to deliver augmented reality campaigns.

Developing the ARROUND Ecosystem
It is a priority for the project to grow as quickly as feasibly possible, engaging new users
and commercial partners in the major capitals around the world in order to drive demand for our
products and the ARR token.
Using our unique competitive advantages, we aim to get a substantial share of the consumer
and commercial augmented reality market within 2-3 years of the project launch.
Our initial launch will take place in Russia, where our technology base is located. By 2021, we plan
to expand the network and attract partners from Europe, Southeast Asia, and the countries of North
America, as well as to increase the user base to 30-50 million people.
To achieve this goal, we plan to fill the AR layer with quality content for users. We also have contacts
with hardware manufacturers (AR glasses) and creative contractors.
Token Model
The fundamental principle of ARROUND is to provide anyone, whether a platform user
or a commercial entity, with the ability to create, publish and distribute an AR experience, safe
in the knowledge that all property and privacy rights as well as commercial interests of all parties are
secured by smart contracts, and that friction free payments and the transparency of each exchange
is also governed by these same contracts.
To this end, ARROUND uses the ARR token as a unit of exchange within the platform.
ARR tokens are used by the platform’s users to purchase or lease digital items or services from
connected developers and by commercial parties in order to run advertising and marketing campaigns.
Additionally, tokens can be used to motivate users to view advertising and marketing campaigns,
plus provide an incentive for users to map their environment, therefore contributing to the creation
of an augmented reality backbone network. Usage of the backbone can be provided to third parties
through payment in ARR tokens. The ARR is the fundamental unit of exchange within the ARROUND
platform, and all commercial activities, although they may be priced in fiat currency, will be conducted
in ARR tokens.
There will be a fixed amount of tokens released during the ICO phase of the project, dependent upon
the amount of tokens purchased by contributors during the Pre-Sale, Private Sale and Main Token Sale.
All unsold tokens will be burned, and no further tokens will be created.
All transactions on the platform, whether concerning users, developers, advertisers or 3rd parties
in any format are executed based on smart contracts and securely stored within the blockchain
immutably. Each action is securely captured and transacted via a smart contract, stored anonymously
in the decentralized blockchain, retrievable via a permissions based architecture that fully supports
privacy management.

ARROUND Business Model
The platform and ecosystem created by ARROUND will be based on the following business model:
• The ARROUND platform will earn money by showing advertisements as well as through the lease
of map data.
•  All prices inside the system will be set in fiat currencies.
•  Payments for ads and purchases inside the system will be made using ARR tokens. Tokens can be
bought using both cryptocurrencies and fiat money.
•  Benefits for users: discounts, bonuses and rewards for performing tasks from advertisers; token
transfers between users .
•  Income sources for service providers: payment for premium content by advertisers and users.
•  Income of blockchain node holders and the owners of servers with content: a share of transaction
fees paid automatically and automatic payments from the Network Development Fund (NDF). All
these payments are expected to be made using smart contracts.
ARR token circulation
on the ARROUND platform
Fiat money and cryptocurrency circulation on the ARROUND platform:
•  Users and advertisers can buy ARR tokens for fiat money or cryptocurrency on exchanges and use
them in the ARROUND platform
•  All payments within the system will be made using ARR tokens which can be exchanged
automatically
The first users of the ARR platform will be token buyers at the ICO, after which any interested person
can buy ARR tokens on an exchange to use the platform.
The ARR token will be released on the basis of ERC20 smart contract on Ethereum blockchain and will
also be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. After a private ARROUND blockchain network is created,
ARR tokens will be exchanged for tokens at 1/1 rate through payment channels on the private
blockchain where the rights of authors and owners of digital assets will be registered and where
an automatic system for making payments for the use of intellectual property will be implemented.

We simplify the processes of supporting and developing of our solution by decompressing
the architecture of the final solution into two subsystems: the first one - for clearing token balances
of system beneficiaries (public) and the second one - to store and process the system’s internal
information (private). We are also able to apply several platforms to perform our tasks instead
of having to use a single platform and trying to make such a platform universal for the entire solution.
The first task can be solved by the implementation of side chain or virtual payment channels
(Ethereum), the second - by using a private platform that corresponds to the network’s future needs. It
can be either peer-to-peer development of a single platform regulated by the market (Ethereum fork)
or development controlled by a dedicated group of internal regulators (Corda, Exonum).
Blockchain and smart contracts:
•  Will be the foundation of the payment system used on the platform and will protect the funds
in users’ token wallets.
•  Will ensure the intellectual rights of authors to content purchased and distributed on the platform.
• The rights to the long-term lease of AR space will give tenants an opportunity to make money
on advertising displays on their AR space.

The AR landscape is growing rapidly. Although ARROUND is focused on the consumer end
of the market, augmented reality has already been heavily adopted within the military, industrial
and medical sectors, where heads up displays are already a reality.
Within the US, the growth in AR usage is incredibly strong, which in turn is driving investment
and development of the technology.

Within the consumer sector, the main players are the hardware and software developers, existing
applications that incorporate augmented reality and companies currently raising money to enter
the augmented reality space.
The most significant events in the AR industry over the last year are related to the introduction
of ARKit and ARCore (by Apple and Google respectively), which promises to finally bring AR technology
to the masses.
There have been some notable deals recently, which provide an insight into the value of AR companies.

Our main competitors in the ICO space are projects planning to sell virtual land such as Arcona,
Spheroid and Mark.Space. One common denominator across all projects is the desire to commercialize
augmented reality through the introduction of advertising space and the subsequent lease and sale
of AR inventory. However, rather than creating geographically fixed AR zones, or encourage an AR land
grab, ARROUND is first and foremost building a platform for people, where it will be able to use
the dynamics of viral marketing in order to attract a worldwide userbase and keep them engaged via
the ability to create their own AR experiences, make new friends and keep in touch with their existing
network. ARROUND will integrate with the world’s most popular social networks in order to drive user
acquisition as well as through special promotions, features and urban quests.
ARRROUND is focused on providing an augmented reality application that provides real world
functionality, and rewards the user not only in tokens but also through enhancing their lives
in measurable ways.

For each token sold at the Pre-sale and Token Sale, another 0.77 tokens will be automatically created
and distributed in the above-mentioned token funds. As a result, the maximum number of tokens will
equal 3,000,000,000 units.
The Community Development Fund (CDF) tokens will be used to encourage partners, develop
the community and attract new users. These tokens will be used as a reward for content creators
and developers involved in developing the ecosystem, as well as for users involved in the pilot testing
of the system.
From the first days after the ICO the token buyers will be able to use tokens in the MVP1
of the ARROUND platform to extend the lifetime of their “rounds” (posts). With time, new features will
appear to on which to spend tokens.

Risks Associated with the ARR Token
and Pre-Sale
Last updated February 18, 2018
The ARR Token is a new and innovative product. This memorandum is intended to apprise you of some
of the risks involved with purchasing, buying, owning, and using the ARR Token. It does not purport
to advise you of all of the risks and other significant aspects of the sale (the “ARR Sale”) by ARROUND
INC. (“ARROUND” or the “Company”) of ARR Network Tokens (the “Tokens”or “ARR Tokens”). You should
also consider any additional risks and considerations relating to the Token Sale and consult your own
legal, tax, financial, and other advisers before entering into any transaction.
There are a number of risks involved in this Token Sale, as well as the future development,
maintenance, and running of the ARROUND Network and Tokens. Some of these risks are beyond
the control of the Company. Each person participating in the Token Sale (“Purchaser”) should
comprehend, consider, and evaluate carefully the risks described below in addition to any
other available information before participating in the Token Sale. Each purchaser should pay
particular attention to the fact that, although the Company is established in Belize, neither
the Company nor the ARROUND Network has any specific physical presence. In addition, the legal
and regulatory position of the Company and the ARROUND Network may vary depending on the facts
and circumstances. They, therefore, fall within the purview of one or more jurisdictions, at least
to some extent, and the legal and regulatory implications may, therefore, be unexpected. Participation
in the Token Sale shall be taken as an action based upon careful and prudent analysis and evaluation,
and will be deemed as the relevant Purchaser having been fully informed, advised, and willing to bear
all of the risks associated with it, including as set out in this memorandum.
A purchase of the ARR Token is not an investment. Rather, the ARR is a utility token that serves
a specific function within the ARROUND Network, which is the only means to access the ARROUND
Network and utilize its functions. Without ARR Token, the general public may not access the ARROUND
Network. There is no guarantee — indeed there is no reason to believe — that the ARR tokens you
purchase will increase in value. They may — and probably will, at some point — decrease in value.
For these and other reasons, we believe the sale of ARR Tokens does not constitute a public offering
of securities subject to prospectus registration requirements. However, public policy towards token
sales is changing, and it is conceivable that regulators may in the future seek to broaden the scope
of regulation of token sales. This could make token sales subject to registration requirements
in the United States and similar jurisdictions. If the ARR Token Sale becomes subject to registration
requirements, this would delay or potentially postpone the proposed ARR Token Sale indefinitely.
1 .   Risks Associated with Purchaser Credentials
Any third party that gains access to the Purchaser’s login credentials or private keys may be able
to dispose of the Purchaser’s Tokens. To minimize this risk, the Purchaser should guard against
unauthorized access to their electronic devices.
2 .   Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions
Crypto-currencies as a form of settlement in trade have been the subject of scrutiny by various
regulatory authorities and may be overseen by the legal and regulatory authorities of a number
of jurisdictions globally. Governments that are adverse to the proliferation of the use
50




of crypto -currencies in local commerce could issue laws and regulations deeming the use
of crypto-currencies a regulated activity. In recent months, some countries, such as China
and Korea, have issued regulations or statements prohibiting token sales, while other countries,
such as Gibraltar, have sought to bring the sale of tokens within the regulator control of securities
offerings .
The functioning of the ARROUND Network and the Tokens could be impacted by one or more
regulatory inquiries or actions, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the use or possession
of digital tokens like the Tokens, which could impede or limit the development of the ARROUND
Network. The Company may receive notices, queries, warnings, requests, or rulings from one
or more authorities upon short notice, or may even be ordered to suspend or terminate any action
in connection with the Token Sale or the ARROUND Network as a whole without prior notice.
Furthermore, many aspects of ARR also involve untested areas of law and regulation, and could
be subject to new laws or regulation, so their legal and regulatory outcome in all relevant
jurisdictions is not possible to predict. The planning, development, marketing, promotion,
execution or otherwise of the Company or the Token Sale may be seriously affected, hindered,
postponed, or terminated as a result. Since regulatory policies can change with or without prior
notice, any existing regulatory permissions for or tolerance of the Company, the ARROUND
Network, and the Token Sale in any jurisdiction may be withdrawn without warning. The Tokens
could be deemed from time to time as a virtual commodity, a digital asset, or even as money,
securities, or currency in various jurisdictions and therefore could be prohibited from being
sold, purchased, traded, distributed, or held in certain jurisdictions pursuant to local regulations .
In turn, the ARROUND Network could be deemed to be a regulated or restricted product. There
is no guarantee that the Company can maintain any particular legal or regulatory status in any
particular jurisdiction at any time.
3 .                                                                                                      CTF and Anti-Money Laundering Regulations
The United States has issued a series of regulations to combat terrorist financing (Counter Terrorist
Financing) and money-laundering activities. Many other countries have enacted similar legislation
to control the flow of capital for such illicit activities. The use of cryptocurrencies by bad actors
would breach such regulations. Any illicit use of the ARR Tokens could seriously impact the global
reputation of the ARROUND Network. In such event, it is not inconceivable that this could trigger
scrutiny by CTF and anti-money laundering regulators and potentially cause significant disruption
to the distribution and circulation of ARR Tokens in the ARROUND ecosystem.
4 .                                                                                                      Blockchain Risks
On the Ethereum blockchain, timing of block production is determined by proof of work so
block production can occur at random times. For example, ETH contributed to the ARR Token
Distribution Contract in the final seconds of a distribution period may not get included for that
period. Purchaser acknowledges and understands that the Ethereum blockchain may not include
the Purchaser’s transaction at the time Purchaser expects and Purchaser may not receive
ARR Tokens the same day Purchaser sends ETH. The Ethereum blockchain is prone to periodic
congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Individuals may also intentionally
spam the Ethereum network in an attempt to gain an advantage in purchasing cryptographic
tokens. Purchaser acknowledges and understands that Ethereum block producers may not include
Purchaser’s transaction when Purchaser wants or Purchaser’s transaction may not be included
at all .
51




5 .                                                                                                   Risk of Insufficient Interest in the ARROUND Network
It is possible that the ARROUND Network will not be used by a large number of businesses,
individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in ARROUND
services.
Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the ARROUND Network and, therefore,
the potential uses or value of the Tokens.
6 .                                                                                                   Risk that the ARROUND Network, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of Purchaser
The ARROUND Network is presently under development and its governance structure, fees,
purpose, consensus mechanism, algorithm, code, infrastructure design, and other technical
specifications and parameters may undergo significant changes without notice. Any expectations
regarding the form and functionality of Tokens or the ARROUND Network held by the Purchaser
may not be met, for any number of reasons, including a change in the design and implementation
plans and execution of the ARROUND Network.
7 .                                                                                                   Risk of Theft and Hacking
Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the ARROUND Network
or the availability of the Tokens in any number of ways, including, without limitation, denial
of service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks.
Additionally, there may be attempts to steal the Token Sale proceeds. Such theft or attempted theft
may impact the ability of the Company to fund the development or maintenance of the ARROUND
Network. While the Company will endeavor to adopt industry best practices to keep the ARROUND
Network and Token Sale proceeds safe (including, but not limited to, the use of cold storage
and multi-signature authentications), successful cyber thefts may still occur.
8 .                                                                                                   Risk of Unpermissioned, Decentralized, and Autonomous Ledger
The ARROUND Network is being developed in connection with various distributed ledger
systems including, but not limited to, Ethereum, which are unpermissioned protocols that could
be accessed and used by anyone. The utility and integrity of the ARROUND Network relies
on the stability, security and popularity of these decentralized ledgers. The ARROUND Network
is envisaged to be an open, decentralized community and its composition can include users,
supporters, developers, Token holders and other participants worldwide who may or may not be
connected with the Company in any manner. Given the diversity of the underlying technologies,
the ARROUND Network is intended to be decentralized and autonomous in nature as far as its
maintenance, governance and evolution are concerned.
9 .                                                                                                   Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography
Cryptography is evolving and there can be no guarantee of security at all times. Advancement
in cryptography technologies and techniques, including, but not limited to, code cracking,
the development of artificial intelligence and/or quantum computers, could be identified as risks
to all cryptography-based systems, including ARROUND Network. When such technologies
and/or techniques are applied to ARROUND Network, adverse outcomes such as theft, loss,
disappearance, destruction, devaluation, or other compromises result. The security of the Company
and the ARROUND Network cannot be guaranteed as the future of cryptography or security
innovations is unpredictable.
52




10 . Risk of Abandonment or Failure
Due to the technically complex nature of the ARROUND Network, the Company or those
contributing to the ARROUND software development effort could face difficulties from
time to time that may be unforeseeable and/or unresolvable. Accordingly, the development
of the ARROUND Network could fail, terminate or be delayed at any time for any reason, including
due to lack of funds. Development failure or termination may render the Tokens untransferable,
of reduced or no utility, and/or obsolete.
11 . Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the ARROUND Network
The utility of the ARR Tokens is dependent on the popularity of the ARROUND Network. While
the ARR Tokens should not be viewed as an investment, they may have value over time.
An absence of active users or low level of utilization may negatively affect the long-term
development and future of the ARROUND Network, and reduce or obviate the utility of the ARR
Tokens.
12 . Risk of an Illiquid Market
After the ARR Token Launch, the Company is not responsible for and has limited control over
the subsequent circulation and trading of the ARR Tokens. The ARR Token is not money, legal
tender or currency, fiat or otherwise, issued by any individual, entity, central bank or national,
supra-national or quasi-national organization, nor is it backed by any type or quantity of assets,
property, or credits, nor does it represent any entitlement to any distributions of profits, dividends,
or any other returns or payments of any kind. There is no obligation of the Company, nor anyone
else, to redeem, repurchase, or acquire any ARR Tokens from any ARR Token holder. There is no
guarantee or assurance that there will be a market or marketplace where holders may readily
trade Tokens.
13 . Risk of Price Volatility
Many cryptographic tokens have volatile prices. Large fluctuations in price over short timeframes
occur frequently. Such fluctuations could result from market dynamics (including, but not limited
to, speculation), regulatory changes, technical advancements, exchange availabilities, and other
factors that impact the equilibrium between token supply and demand.
14 . Risk of Potential Concentrated Ownership of Tokens
Immediately after the completion of the ARR Token Sale, a number of individuals may directly
or indirectly hold significant portions of the total available ARR Tokens. These ARR Token holders
may have significant influence over the Company, including its operational decisions. These
significant ARR Token holders may, acting alone or in concert, not necessarily make decisions that
are in the best interests of the other Token holders or of the ARROUND community as a whole.
15 . Risk of Uninsured Losses
Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, funds held using
a blockchain network are generally uninsured. In the event of loss or loss of value, there is no
public insurer, such as the FDIC or private insurer, to offer recourse to the Purchaser.
16 . Risk of Privacy and Data Retention Issues
As part of the ARR Token Sale and the subsequent verification processes, the Company may collect
personal information from Purchasers. The collection of such information is subject to applicable
laws and regulations. All information collected will be used for purposes of ARR Token Sale
53




and ARROUND community management for the ARROUND Network and may be transferred
to contractors, service providers and consultants worldwide as appointed by the Company.
Apart from external compromises, the Company and its appointed entities may also suffer from
internal security breach whereby their employees may misappropriate, misplace, or lose personal
information of Purchasers. The Company may be required to expend significant financial resources
to alleviate problems caused by any breaches or losses, settle fines, and resolve inquiries from
regulatory or government authorities. Any information breaches or losses will also damage
the Company reputation and thereby may harm its long term prospects.
17 . Risk of Malfunction in the ARROUND Network
It is possible that the ARROUND Network malfunctions in an unfavorable way, including, but not
limited to, one that results in the loss of ARR Tokens.
18 . Risk Relating to Use of the Internet or Other Electronic Medium
Without limiting the foregoing risks, any communication or transaction via or information
(including document) transmitted via the internet or other electronic medium involves risks and,
by participating in the ARR Token Sale or utilizing the ARROUND Network, you acknowledge that
you understand and accept the following risks:
•                                                                                                  We and/or third parties may use such authentication technologies as we deem appropriate.
No authentication, verification, or computer security technology is completely secure or safe.
You agree to bear all risks of unauthorized access/use, hacking, or identity theft.
•                                                                                                  The internet or other electronic media (including, without limitation, electronic devices,
services of third party telecom service providers, such as mobile phones or other handheld
trading devices or interactive voice response systems) are an inherently unreliable form
of communication.
•                                                                                                  Any information (including any document) transmitted, or communication, or transactions
made, over the internet or through other electronic media (including electronic devices,
services of third party telecom service providers, such as mobile phones or other handheld
trading devices or interactive voice response systems) may be subject to interruption,
transmission blackout, delayed transmission due to data volume, internet traffic, market
volatility, or incorrect data transmission (including incorrect price quotation) or stoppage
of price data feed due to the public nature of the internet or other electronic media.
•                                                                                                  As a result of such unreliability:
a . there may be time-lags, delays, failures, or loss of data, or loss of confidentiality

19 . Tax Risk Relating to Participation in the Token Sale
The use of ARR Tokens as a form of settlement currency may or may not be subject to local
income tax, capital gain taxes, VAT, or other forms of taxes. The taxability of cryptographic
tokens is an evolving area of law, is subject to change, and may vary amongst jurisdictions. This
uncertainty in tax legislation may expose merchants and customers alike to unforeseen future
tax consequences associated with the use of ARR Tokens. In some instances, there may be little
or no formal regulatory guidance. Participation in the ARR Token Sale may have tax reporting
implications and liabilities for Purchasers and such liabilities and obligations shall be borne
by the Purchasers alone. Purchasers are advised to consult their tax advisors prior to participating
in the ARR Token Sale.
20 . Unanticipated Risks
Applied cryptography and blockchain technology are new and untested. In addition to the risks set
forth here, there are risks that the ARROUND team cannot anticipate. Risks may further materialize
as unanticipated combinations or variations of the risks set forth here.
