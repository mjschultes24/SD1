1. Online gaming - An Introduction
Online gaming, or gambling, is the wagering of something valuable, usually asset or
money, on the outcome of an event or game, using the Internet. It usually includes
various activities such as casino gaming, sports betting, bingo and other lotteries. Of
these, casino games and sports betting account for the largest market share[1]. In 2015,
the online gaming market had a volume of 37.91 billion U.S. dollars[2]. And according to
market analysts, this figure is forecasted to increase to 59.79 billion U.S. dollars in 2020[2].
Despite the booming market, the online gaming industry is plagued by three significant
issues.
Lack of Trust - Trust is an important factor, especially in online games, where a certain
central  gaming  authority  is  accountable  for  keeping  the  players'  bets  as  well  as
winnings safe. Building trust is difficult, especially for smaller, newer casinos or gaming
centers. People usually aren’t confident enough to place bets on a platform which
doesn't have the necessary resources required for the safekeeping of players' assets.
There is also the additional factor of fraud; the gaming authority might tend to cheat
players into depositing assets of significant value, and then disappear without paying
back the players with their rightful winnings. Alternatively, players might tend to fool the
gaming authorities into winning a significant value in assets through illegal or dishonest
means.
Lack of Anonymity - In the online gaming landscape, multiple players are competing
against each other and a significant value in assets is almost always at stake. As such,
some players might want to keep their identities hidden for personal security. This is not
always the case with conventional online games.
High Commission fees - Keeping transactional commission fees low has always been a
challenge in the online gaming industry. Low fees encourage maximum participation
from players, as well as enabling them to place micro bets, such that the participation
fees are fairly insignificant compared to the total value of the bets placed. But, usually
the operational costs for running a casino, even an online one, is significant , and it
becomes mandatory to keep commission fees in order to keep the platform running over
the long term.
2. Our Solution
SmartPlay.tech has developed a unique, decentralized gaming platform, based on
Ethereum Smart Contracts, aiming to take advantage of the Blockchain technology in
online games to counter these aforementioned issues.
First, the platform eliminates the trust factor and brings complete transparency into the
system with the help of Blockchain. The honesty of the game is confirmed by an open
algorithm locked via a smart contract. It is impossible for anyone to alter the game
conditions or predict the result of the game in the Blockchain. Moreover, there is no
deposit required. Funds are controlled by the player and their winnings are directly
transferred to their wallets. All the in-game transactions, including the processing of
3




bets  and  payout  of  winnings,  are  visible  to  the  players  and  investors,  enabling
transparency within the platform.
Second, the use of cryptocurrency in gaming addresses the question of anonymity for
the  players.  People  can  participate  in  online  games  without  any  requirement  of
registration, documentation or verification. Further, the players’ wallet addresses, which
are primarily used for in-game transactions, cannot be associated with any personally
identifiable  information.  Hence,  players  can  participate  in  the  online  games
anonymously without worrying about their safety. It is to be noted, however, that we do
not encourage the use of anonymity as an advantage for illegal participation of players
from locations where gambling is banned. Access to our platform and its games are
blocked from such locations.
Third,  we  are  continuously  working  on  the  implementation  of  new  and  under
development Blockchain forks that tend to minimize and even eliminate transaction
fees. We have already been able to reduce the operating costs, particularly related to
commissions during in-game transactions. As a result, one of the games implemented
on our platform, was able to reach a certain level of operating profitability.
We  have  developed  and
launched the prototype of the
European  Roulette  game,
called  SmartRoulette,  based
o n  a n  E t h e r e u m  S m a r t
Contract.  We  have  tried  to
make the gaming experience
productive, fully functional and
complete,  by  offering  the
following features:
• Various types of bets, such as Corner, Split, Sixline, etc.;
• The possibility of placing up to 64 bets on different fields per turn;
• Provably fair random number generation, as well as fully automated payouts, being
governed by the smart contract;
• Open source smart contract code available on GitHub, its transparency may be
verified by any Blockchain developer;
• All results of the smart contract are permanently stored in the Ethereum Blockchain.
The game uses the Ethereum DApp browser to interact among the client browser, the
Ethereum Blockchain and our smart contract via the SmartRoulette.io interface. For
Google Chrome users, one has to install the MetaMask extension to enable these
features. The game is available on both the Ethereum Main network (MainNet) as well as
on the Test network (TestNet). After signing up, a user may select the TestNet mode, and
get several free ETH test coins to try the game.
We have also announced the launch of SmartBox[3] - a Blockchain based gambling
machine working on Ethereum smart-contracts. It is a first-of-its-kind solution in the
gambling industry, in which smart contract algorithms are used to implement traditional
slot machine games.
The SmartBox software is based on the SmartRoulette gaming mechanics, and includes
all the advantages of our platform. Transparency and honesty are guaranteed by a
4




smart  contract,  which  cannot  be  altered,  even  by  the  SmartBox  owner,  since  the
Blockchain ensures the permanence of data and game code.
3. Smart Contract Token - RLT
RLT (RouletteToken) is an ERC20 token, created for the primary purpose of its use in
various blockchain-based gaming solutions developed by SmartPlay.tech. RLT tokens
can easily be transferred among participants via Ethereum network addresses. They
can also be transferred from and to supported cryptocurrency exchange accounts.
3.1 Token details
Name: Roulette token (RLT)
Initial amount: 10,000,000 (10 million)
Initial price: 1.00 RLT = USD 0.07 (0.0015 ETH)
Token standard: ERC20
3.2 Initial distribution of tokens
• 2,500,000 RLT (25%) - Funded for token distribution during ICO (Crowdsale);
• 2,500,000 RLT (25%) - Rewards for developers and initial investors of the project;
• 5,000,000 RLT (50%) - Reserved for system maintenance — costs associated with
servers,  domains,  refilling  bankroll  of  existing  and  new  game  versions,  bounty
payouts and other overhead costs.
3.3 How to get tokens
There are several ways to get tokens. As of now, users can acquire RLT tokens by:
• Purchasing tokens during ICO;
• Placing bets in SmartRoulette (p. 8);
• Assisting in the testing, development and promotion of the project;
• Attracting players via the affiliate program;
• Purchasing tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges.
4. Issue of RLT tokens
RLT token liquidity is primarily backed up by our products, which are games running on
Ethereum  smart  contracts.  Therefore,  to  maintain  the  economic  sense  and
attractiveness of the tokens, we bind the volume of tokens issued, to the quantity and
the volume of games played.
5




4.1 Emission formula
RLT tokens are generated after a bet is placed using ETH, in any version of Roulette.
Generation of tokens is governed by the following formula:
Emission = Bet * coef / RLT rate, where:
Emission  (in RLT)  - Number of new tokens generated and received by players after
placing a bet.
Bet (in ETH) - A player's bet size.
coef - The coefficient of return received by a player after placing a bet. This number is
defined by the administrator as follows:
Test period 03.14.2017 - 03.21.2017                                                           3%
Test period 03.22.2017 - 03.29.2017                                                           2.5%
Test period 03.30.2017 - 04.06.2017                                                           2%
Test period 04.07.2017 - 04.14.2017                                                           1.5%
After 04.15.2017                                                                              0.5%
RLT rate - The current rate of RLT token to ETH on cryptocurrency exchanges.
4.2 Economic Justification
Roulette token holders have no reason to worry about the value of RLT being impacted
by emission of new tokens, as:
• A significant volume of token emission is only possible in case of high player activity,
increase in demand and increase in popularity of RLT. The more the players' activity,
the higher the popularity of RLT token and its value, leading to decrease in the
issue volume equivalent to bets, as the emission volume is inversely proportional to
a token rate;
• At the same time players receive instant guaranteed bonuses in RLT tokens backed
up by ETH cryptocurrency at the current rate and automatically become members
of the loyalty reward system. All this eventually leads to increase in players' interest
as well as the popularity of the project.
Here we present several examples to help understand how the algorithm works*:
Date: 03.17.2017
coef: 3%
Rate: 1 RLT = 0.0015 ETH
A player places a bet 0.5 ETH. According to the formula, the smart contract issues 0.5 *
0.03 / 0.0015 = 10 RLT and send them to player's balance.
*
Definite numbers are shown to simplify calculations as per the algorithm, and may differ in
reality.
6




Date: 05.04.2017
coef: 2%
Rate: 1 RLT = 0.004 ETH
A player places a bet 0.5 ETH. According to the formula, the smart contract issues 0.5 *
0.02 / 0.004 = 2.5 RLT and send them to player's balance.
Date: 17.04.2017
coef: 0.5%
Rate: 1 RLT = 0.011 ETH
A player places a bet 0.5 ETH. According to the formula, the smart contract issues 0.5 *
0.005 / 0.011 = 0.227 RLT and send them to players' balance.
5. Loyalty Rewards System
All loyal users have the privilege of receiving loyalty rewards for their contribution to the
project. Loyalty reward points are built up from gaming activity, thus appraising users for
their quality work and encouraging them to create additional value.
Initial amount of tokens necessary for participation in the loyalty reward system is 1,000
RLT,  which  can  be  acquired  by  using  SmartPlay.tech  products,  participating  in  its
promotion or playing in its games. In the course of the project development, this number
will vary.
This  new  loyalty  program  is  currently  under  development.  Further  details  will  be
available on the Smartplay.tech website.
5.1 RLT Token as a multi-functional utility token
RLT  is  mainly  used  as  an  in-game  token  for  playing  various  games  on  the
SmartPlay.Tech platform. For example, it is now utilized for playing “European roulette”
on Smartroulette.io. It could also be utilized for accessing several existing apps and
services on the platform, as well as the ones developed in future. Hence, RLT serves as a
utility token. Users can also exchange RLT in supported exchanges, such as Livecoin,
YoBit, etc., so the tokens aren’t just locked in within the platform.
In the current loyalty rewards system, reward payouts are directly dependent on the
user activities, rather than being a regular dividend payout. Hence, this system is now a
reward-based loyalty program, which is not subject to any regulation by the authorities.

6. Bonuses and Bounty
6.1 Bonuses for Players
When a bet is placed using ETH, new RLT tokens are generated according to the
Emission formula (p. 6), and as a bonus for the player, the new tokens thus generated
are sent to the same Ethereum address, which was used to place the bet.
Tokens are paid regardless of the game result. After receiving tokens, the player can use
them for different purposes:
• Utilize  the  tokens  to  access  games  and  services  across  the  Smartplay.tech
platform;
• Send them to any other Ethereum network user;
• Trade them on any of the supported cryptocurrency exchanges.
6.2 Bug Bounty and Contribution Rewards
Developers can also contribute to our project by testing our games/software, and
reporting new bugs found in the system. Users who are able to find major bugs are
rewarded in RLT. Additionally, any person contributing to the project in any way, if
recognized by the team, shall also be eligible for bounty rewards. Bug bounty and other
bounty rewards are distributed from the funds reserved for system maintenance. Please
send your requests via email to info@smartplay.tech.
7. Affiliate Program
As per our affiliate program, any player who refers another player via their affiliate link
gets rewarded whenever the referred player places a bet using RLT.
7.1 Terms
Every participant of the project can take part in the affiliate program by procuring an
affiliate link and sharing the same to other people via:
• Personal websites;
• Public forums;
• Instant messages / Chats;
• Social Networks;
• Media Reviews;
• Direct referrals.
What is strongly prohibited:
• To send spam;
• To post information relating to the project on non-thematic sections of forums,
blogs, etc.;
• To publish misleading information about the project.

7.2 Rewards
Players who join the platform via affiliate links become permanently associated to the
respective players who referred them, after placing the first bet. The affiliate is rewarded
in RLT by the smart contract for each bet the referred player places using RLT. Currently,
affiliate rewards are valid for lifetime as long as the referred player continues placing
bets using RLT, although this could change in future. This reward is currently equal to
0.5% of each bet (not depending on the game result), and may be modified later for
better effectiveness.
Here we present several examples to help understand how the affiliate program works:
You post your affiliate link on your Facebook page and 7 users follow it. Only one of
them installs the MetaMask extension and places the first bet amount of 100 RLT. At that
moment, the particular user is permanently associated with you and you get your first
reward calculated according to the following:
Reward = (coef %) of Bet = 0.5% of 100 RLT = 100 RLT * 0.005 = 0.5 RLT
During the following months the referred user places bets with total amount of 18000
RLT in 100 games providing you with a total reward of 18000 RLT * 0.005 = 90 RLT.
8. Development roadmap
Our development plans for the near future, funded by our primary investments as well as
the teams’ personal expenses, are as follows†:
Q3 2018
• Implementing a solution to further optimize transaction fees.
• Adaptation  of  smart  contract  in  our  game  under  the  Casper  update  for  the
Ethereum Blockchain.
• Creating and implementing a new design for existing games.
• Researching  to  find  possible  solutions  to  decentralize  the  winning  payouts.
Currently these payouts are handled by our team; the idea is to the finance the
winners’ payments from a special fund powered by private investors, who would
receive benefits from the profits of the game.
Q4 2018
• Adding support for specialized browsers with built-in access into the Ethereum
network.
• Completion of the development and testing of the new game - Bingo - followed by
game launch.
• Creating an interface with easy access to an open Roulette transactions database.
†
This roadmap may be modified later for better effectiveness, as per the market conditions.
9




• Researching the possibilities of EOS smart contracts with the goal to create a
gaming solution based on it.
Q1 2019
• Researching  on  the  possibility  of  creating  a  multiplayer  mode  for  the  existing
games, so several players could play at a single roulette table.
• Integrate player chat.
• Exploring possible concepts for creating a multiplayer Poker game.
9. Development team
Our team of developers is experienced in the field of Blockchain technology for more
than 4 years. The concept of smart contracts represents the minimization of human
involvement, and that is the very ideology, which inspired us when we started the
project                                                                                       —  trust  the  code  and  numbers,  rather  than  the  creators’  authority  or
advertisement.
There were several reasons for us to consider keeping the identities of the project
founders, developers and testers a secret; a significant one among them being the fact
that the legal status of cryptocurrencies is still questionable in the developers’ home
country, and casinos are not allowed to operate outside permitted zones.
But,  due  to  high  demand  from  the  community,  the  team  is  now  considering  the
possibility of revealing their identities to the public in near future.
10. ICO (Crowdsale) - Ended
10.1 Summary
We  have  successfully  completed  the  ICO  for  RLT  token.  The  three-day  crowdsale
started on 7th of April, 2017 at 12:00 GMT, with the initial price of RLT being 0.0015 ETH,
and ended on 10th of April, 2017. In total, the Smartplay.tech platform was able to raise
2873.592 ETH, which was roughly equivalent to  $126,150 as of  04/10/2017. The total
number of tokens sold at the time of ICO was 1,874,170.
10.2 Goals
We put realistic goals ahead of us to ensure that the collected funds are used for
definite purposes aimed at delivering results. The following were some of the immediate
goals we had in mind at the time of ICO:
• To launch the affiliate program in order to boost the popularity of the platform and
the game among new players;
• To provide RLT token holders with sustainable loyalty rewards;
• Introduce RLT token within popular cryptocurrency exchange markets;
10




• To  develop  and  launch  a  voting  system  for  RLT  token  holders  allowing  its
participants  to  make  decisions  concerning  the  game  development  and  its
promotion;
• To present SmartRoulette game with animated 3D design, along with visual and
sound effects;
• To develop and launch a set of additional Roulette versions with various types of
bets and options (for e.g., American Roulette, Russian Roulette, etc.).
Since the ICO held last year, we have completed most of the ICO goals, a few others
are in progress, while some new ones have also been added. We plan to develop the
following games in the future:
• Bingo;
• Poker;
• Blackjack;
• Slots.
For more information on our updated near-term goals, refer to p. 9.
10.3 Distribution of ICO funds
• 60% of the collected funds was used for carrying out an advertising campaign to
promote our game;
• 20% of the funds are being used for development of SmartRoulette game, as well
as launching additional versions of the game;
• 20% of the funds are reserved as rewards for developers and initial investors of the
project.
10.4 Mechanism of ICO implementation
RLT tokens were initially priced at 0.0015 ETH during the ICO. The smart contract only
allowed a total purchase of RLT tokens worth between 0.15 ETH and 500 ETH. In case of
a valid purchase, the equivalent amount of RLT tokens was immediately sent to the
Ethereum address used for the purchase. Moreover, no deposits were accepted from
countries like the U.S. and Canada, where there are strict security regulations in place.
Collection of deposits was discontinued after three days from the start of the ICO.
