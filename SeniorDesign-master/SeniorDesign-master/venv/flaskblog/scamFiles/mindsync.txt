Abstract
The age of AI technologies is well and truly upon us. While movies like
The  Matrix  have  shown  us  the  cataclysmic  effects  of  intelligent
machines,  we  cannot  ignore  the  vast  benefits  that  AI  technologies
bring to businesses today. The use of AI technologies can help reduce
operational   costs,  increase  efficiency,   grow   revenue   and   vastly
improve  the  customer  experience.  And  unbeknownst  to  us,  we  are
surrounded by intelligent devices that are making our lives easy.
Businesses around the world are realizing the awesome powers and
capabilities AI technologies can bring to their processes. And it has
been estimated that global spending on cognitive and AI systems will
surpass  $19 billion in  2018, an increase of more than  50% over the
amount spent last year. This shows the tremendous interest of global
businesses   to   secure   a   competitive   advantage   by   using   AI
technologies. However, like any growing market, the AI market also
suffers from certain pain points, which, if not addressed, may prove to
hinder the effective utilization of this truly transformative technology.
MindSync is a platform and a global community of AI/ML experts so
that businesses  of all kinds and  sizes may  benefit from  world  class
talent  on  a  single  platform.  Customers  can  order  customized  AI
solutions through ML/DS challenges or choose from a wide collection
of ready solutions.
Apart from these, the MindSync platform will also look to strategically
partner with decentralized supercomputer projects and crypto mining
farms  and  make  this  computing  power  available  to  community
members  and  customers.  This  will  help  reduce  the  high  costs  for
availing    computing    capabilities    and    allow    everyone,    from
schoolchildren   to   scientists,   to   use   the   previously   inaccessible
computational  power  in  their  projects  and  open  new  horizons  for
researchers in AI domain.

Vision
1.1 Problem
The major pain points in the path to utilization of AI tech include:
Lack of enough experts
The demand for applied AI experts, data scientists, machine learning
and  deep  learning  developers  is  growing  every  day.  Today  these
specialists  are  rare  and  expensive.  But  in  spite  of  it  all,  highly
competitive  nature  of  business  requires  highly  skilled  personnel  to
find efficient solutions in the shortest time. The scarcity and costs of
these resources are a big problem for organizations using, or wanting
to use, AI technologies.
Complexity in integration and adaptation
Despite  the  AI  industry  development,  in  pursuit  of  ready-made  AI
solutions applicable for solving real business problems, and in other
areas, their integration and adaptation are still a complex question.
High demand of computing power, and eventually, costs
Data  science  and  machine  learning  tasks  are  usually  resource
intensive ones and can be efficiently solved using a large number of
CPU and/or GPUs. Using cloud services such as Google Cloud, Amazon
AWS,  Microsoft  Azure  can  solve  that  problem,  though  with  an
unreasonably high price.
Security issues
AI  tech  is  increasingly  being  integrated  into  high-tech  consumer
products.  This  can potentially  affect our life  and  safety  in ways  we
cannot even begin to imagine. Without independent automated data
integrity  check  and  version  control,  it  is  not  possible  to  guarantee
replicability  that  is  crucial  in  applied  machine  learning  algorithms
with high security requirements.
5




1.2 Proposed solution
To address these issues, MindSync is creating a unified platform to:
Establish  an  active  community  of  experts  in  the  field  of  AI
technologies like machine learning  (ML), computer vision  (CV), deep
learning  (DL),  natural  language  processing  (NLP)  and  data  science
(DS). This community will be a source of contact for customers of all
sizes to access state-of-the-art AI-based solutions for their businesses
and   will   develop   AI   solutions,   share   experience,   and   improve
competence on the MindSync platform.
Creating  the  marketplace  for  ready  AI  solutions  (ML-models  and
datasets).  Placing  production-ready  solutions  on  the  marketplace  in
enterprise-ready containers. Solutions may be paid or free. This will
allow  developers  of  high-quality  and  popular  solutions  to  use  the
MindSync platform as a source of steady income or to contribute to
the community and help other participants build new solutions based
on them as well as improve their own skills.
Exploitation  of  crypto  mining  farms  and  exchange of computing
power among some participants of the community. This significantly
reduces  computation  cost  by  threefold  in  comparison  with  cloud
computing.   MindSync   will   use   its   own   computing   resources,
supercomputer projects such as SONM, and cloud services to diversify
denial-of-service risks and provide maximum quality of their services.
Deployment  of  a  blockchain  assures  security  and  data  integrity.
Persistence of ML-models hashes, data, solution quality assessments,
solution ratings, and the platform participant metadata are all saved in
the  embedded  blockchain.  It  allows  to  verify  objects  and  their
dependencies that is crucially important in development of replicable
and safe solutions.

1.3 Our vision and mission
MindSync  is  an  AIaaS                                                         (AI-as-a-Service)  and  ExaaS   (Expert-as-a-
Service)  platform.  We  seek  to  help  solve  business  problems  of
customers  through  AI-based  solutions  that  are  created  through
rewarding  competitions  within  the  community  or  through  choosing
from a wide range of production-ready solutions in our repository.
We are on a mission to provide better and cheaper AI solutions for a
wide  range  of  businesses  through  a  readily  available  community  of
experts.  While  customers  will  be  spoilt  for  choice  at  the  available
talent on the platform, the community members also get a platform to
earn  rewards,  exchange  experience  and  interact  with  like-minded
individuals for personal and professional growth.

How it works
3.1 The product
On the MindSync platform, customers can ask for the creation of a
customized AI-based solution to their business problems, by creating a
challenge.  This  challenge  will  be  visible  to  all  the  community
members.  Interested  experts  on  the  platform  will  register  their
participation in the challenge after accepting the terms and conditions
governing   it.   The   expert                                                  (individual   or   team)   participates   in
competition by send code and/or predictions. Winner that successfully
creates  the  solution  will  submit  their  entry  for  the  review  of  the
customer as well as other experts in the community. Once the review
is successful, the customer buys the solution that can be integrated
into their business processes. MindSync will also be a repository for
readymade AI-based solutions and training datasets that a customer
can look for.
MindSync  will  allow  to  host  solutions  on  the  platform  and  make  it
accessible via API without any deploying. This is dramatically simplify
integration of the solution.
3.2 Platform interactions
MindSync entities:
Member - MindSync provides free registration for any person via web
or mobile app by creating MindSync account. The benefits that the
platform  provides  are  only  accessible  via  MindSync  account.  The
member can be either Expert/Developer or Customer or both. Experts
define problems supplied by customers. They help to formulate and
adapt   the   problem.   They   accumulate   ratings   and   values   by
10




participating  in  competitions  and  projects.  Every  member  of  the
platform has track-record and verified rating that allows to evaluate
the contribution to the platform. There is also available an option to
pass KYC verification. The provided personal information is hashed.
Hashes  are  stored  by  platform's  blockchain.  The  private  data  also
helps in making the interaction between experts and customers more
trusted  and  transparent,  e.g. signing  NDA  before  starting  a project
make greater sense.
The platform allows customers to place tasks mostly in the form of a
competition, since competition format provides the most efficient way
of problem solving. Other forms of interactions are possible too and
are subject to research.
Organization/Group  - Members can create an organization. It unites
members  into  a  group  and  provides  more  comfortable  way  for
collaboration. Organization can also be a customer which initiates a
competition. Organization provides privacy and restricts access to the
datasets.
Community  -  Basically,  all  the  members  and  organizations  are  the
platform's community. The accumulated knowledge is shared among
the community. Community is the pool of experts that can participate
in solving and defining tasks. One of MindSync project's main goals is
the creation of a global community of DS/ML experts and using this
huge talent pool to help solve business problems by creating cutting-
edge AI-based solutions.
Platform  - The platform's role is to provide technical support for the
project's ecosystem. It attracts members and expands the community.
The platform is engaged in maintaining the project's economy, models
market and in developing resources for the community.    The role of
the  platform  will  be  assumed  by  the  MindSync  team  prior  to  the
development of the DAO.
11




Dataset - A set of datasets in the MindSync system will be available.
Datasets can be private and public, accessible to the whole community
or   within   individual(s)   organization(s)/group(s).   In   the   case   of
publication, it's necessary to specify the conditions (license) on which
the  other  participants  of  the  platform  can  use  the  information
contained  in dataset. Datasets can be provided by participants  in a
packaged (archived) form and can contain any kind of information, but
basically  it  can  be  imaged  as  CSV  file  or  set  of  images.  The
information contained in datasets is hashed. Hashes are stored in the
platform's   blockchain.   This   functionality   provides   guarantees   of
integrity and immutability of the information contained in datasets.
Solution                                                                         -  Basically,  this  is  the  final  executable  and  source  code
representing  learning  procedure  and  final  inference.  The  MindSync
platform   also   provides   tools   for   versioning   and   hashing   code
developed  by  the  participants.  The  release  mechanism  creates  a
snapshot, computes the hash and stores it in the blockchain.
Project/Competition  - A set of terms and conditions in the context of
which the task and the goal are defined. Requirements pertaining to
the   development   of   solutions   is   iterated   in   the   process   of
communication between customers and experts through the MindSync
platform.
The mechanism of interaction of participants depends on their role. In
the  process  of  interaction,  knowledge  is  generated  in  form  of
experience, models or source code. These artifacts are made available
to  other  participants,  serve  to  accelerate  the  dissemination  of
information and strengthen the Community.
12




Incentives  for  Members  includes  knowledge,  contribution  to  the
community,  personal  rating  as  verified  skill  score  and  money  as  a
reward for their work.
For  Customers,  the  benefit  are  in  the  form  of  solving  a  specific
problem by attracting a lot of specialists and providing a quick test of
a large number of hypotheses, or consulting in the case of absence of
its in-house experts.
It  is  also  important  to  notice  that  interaction  with  the  Community
includes   healthy   communication   and   consultations   with   several
experts, which negates the likelihood of making a wrong decision.
3.3 Competitions
Competitions  are  a  way  to  get  a  strong  solution  to  a  problem  in  a
relatively short time. The advantage of the competition is that a large
number of competent people work on the task, who manage to test a
large  number  of  hypotheses.  As  a  result,  the  customer  receives  a
working algorithm and, what is often more important, the knowledge
that the result obtained cannot be improved at low cost.
In other words, the decisions obtained as a result of contests are an
approximation  to  the  upper  possible  limit  of  the  quality  of  the  ML
model.
This   circumstance   makes   competitions   extremely   effective   in
applications where even a relatively small improvement in the quality
of the forecast is in demand by the business.
As example, to get a result similar to the competition, and to check a
comparable   number   of   hypotheses,   you   need   several                    (tens)
personyears of work.
13




Task  requirements  come  from  the  customer,  but  at  this  stage  it's
possible to involve community experts for consultation and assistance.
The competition mechanics are tailored to a specific task, but the
general mechanism is as follows:
1.  The terms and metric are determined and the data for training is
given to the participants.
2.  Participants optimize the metric in the framework of the contest
rules.
3.  The final assessment of the ML-models takes place on the test
dataset.
4.  Winners and top participants are awarded in proportion to their
contribution.
5.  Solutions,  approaches  and  experiences  are  documented  and
become knowledge of the community.
6.  All participants receive ratings.
7.  The ML-model is published on the platform market.
The mechanics of the competition, additional restrictions, the method
of  choosing  the  winner  and  other  nuances  may,  if  necessary,  be
redefined by the Customer to match the original task.
The benefits of using the MindSync platform:
•   For  participants                                                        -  experience,  knowledge,  contribution  to  the
community, reward, rating.
                                                                             •   For  customers  -  the  solution  of  their  problem,  insights  about
their specific data.
•   For   the   platform                                                     -                                                                            community   development,   increasing
engagement, developing market models.

3.4 Reputation system
The  rating  system  (also  reputational)  is  an  important  part  of  the
MindSync  platform.  This  is  one  of  the  key  components  of  the
gamification  process.  In  addition,  the  rating  system  is  a  tool  for
measuring the progress and achievements of a particular participant,
and can be used to confirm his competence.
The rating consists of three main components:
I.  The  first  component  is  competitive;  it  reflects  success  in  solving
problems by the Participant. Its value is determined by:
•   a range of tasks in which the Participant participated
•   position (s)he occupied in the standings
•   level of competition in these tasks
II. The second component reflects the contribution to the Community
and includes:
•   disclosure of Participant’s solutions and their description
•   participation in discussions
•   preparation of training materials
•   interaction with customers and preparation of competitions
III. The third component is self-regulatory, which allows participants to
redistribute  some  share  of  their  own  reputation  points  at  their
discretion. It is intended to give the Community a tool for expressing
the recognition of individual participants where the rating formula is
not flexible enough.
All three components are of interest both separately and in aggregate.
On their basis, it will be possible to build a system of certification and
15




grading  of  specialists  for  targeted  attraction  of  people  with  the
required level to projects.
The reputation system claims the right to be called an instrument for
objective  measurement  of  a  person’s  success  on  the  platform;
therefore, it is important that it is transparent and reliable. This will
be ensured by the use of blockchain technology that will eliminate the
possibility of a fake or overstatement.
16




3.5 Platform use cases
Competitions can be viewed as an instrument for obtaining a solution,
for  accelerating  research,  and  as  a  way  to  strengthen  a  brand.  In
addition to competitions, it’s possible to organize any other format of
interaction with the community on the Platform.
Market solutions is a convenient tool for typical tasks. An example is
the model for determining adult content in a photo.
Such a task is not tied to the specifics of a particular application and
may be framed as a reusable component.
Examples of such tasks are include:
• gender prediction by text
• comment toxicity determination
• sentiment analysis of the text
• objects recognition
• face recognition
Using a turnkey solution allows to get a high enough quality in a short
time.  And  if  there  is  a  need  to  improve  the  quality  of  a  specific
application - it's possible to attract members of the Community.
Large  companies  have  long  been  holding  competitions  to  solve
machine  learning  problems.  One  of  the  most  famous  examples  is
Netflix which, in 2006, held a competition to develop an algorithm of
the recommender system with a prize of $ 1M.

System architecture
MindSync at its core is a decentralized software/data marketplace and
contest host for data science companies, data scientist and software
engineers.
We  will  implement  MindSync  using  Ethereum*  on  smart  contracts.
Ethereum  smart  contracts  will  be  able  to  provide  security,  fault
tolerance, real decentralization and host a community of developers
which will develop tasks, contests and features on the platform. There
will be off-chain services: IPFS and computation power providers for
storing data/solutions/models and testing it. Providers and IPFS nodes
will  communicate  with  users  on  the  platform  and  will  also  have
reputations and MAI tokens at stake.
So basically our system will use two-layer consensus (also third layer
for results of each competition) with miners on first blockchain layer
and  proof  of  reputation  on  smart  contracts.  It  will  suffice  platform
goals of integrity, security, fairness, transparency and availability.
* We understand current Ethereum scalability issues and in the future either
Ethereum will be able to solve its scalability problems or we will develop our
own  x100  faster  blockchain  with  Proof-of-Stake-like  consensus  with  smart
contracts,  sidechains  and  sharding  to  scale  our  platform  for               >1000
transactions per second
18




4.1 Solution
A solution consists of four basic parts:
1. Source code  (in any programming language or its combination, if
not specified by requirements)
2. ML model
3. Docker container
4. Documentation
The code must be readable and reproducible; in other words if you
have source data and code then you can get the same ML model.
The solution is placed in a docker container. This makes it possible to
reuse the solution without having to repeat the data preparation and
model training procedures.
4.2 Data storage
Data storage will be organized as a distributed data warehouse using
MindSync  base  network  data  servers  and  data  storage  suppliers’
resources.
All data on the platform is divided into two parts:
1.  Tiny  data,  such  as  links  to  datasets  and  ML  models,  ratings,
transactions, members info, etc. are stored in the blockchain.
2. Datasets and ML-models are stored in IPFS.
MindSync intellectual data storage coordinator will be developed to
ensure high data availability and security.
19




4.3 Distributed computing
MindSync  will  use  its  own  computing  network  along  with  cloud
services and computing power of supercomputer projects like SONM,
Iagon supercomputer and Golem as computing resources for platform
members and services. This will allow to build high scalable services.
4.4 Blockchain
MindSync  will  implement  the  platform  using  Ethereum  on  smart
contracts. There will be several smart contracts types to implement all
features of MindSync:
1. For machine learning contests. Each platform user will be able
to create smart contract using our templates with problem description
and  links  for  training  data/other  resources  (here  the  user  accepts
public risks that the data which he provides is secure). He also creates
competition rules and duration of contest. He pays fees depending on
how long this contest will take and pledges prizes. Prizes will be given
to the top score experts/developers after contest is concluded. User
can   provide   his   list   of   experts/IPFS   nodes/computation   power
providers or create a pool so that platform users can choose them for
best fairness and services. Client then pays providers a small fee in
MAI   tokens   after   competition   starts.   During   the   competition,
participants   send   their   solutions   to   IPFS   nodes,   experts   and
computation power providers using MindSync API services. Providers
then commit results as links for each user solution, calculate score
and hash of solution data so that it meets platform security needs and
protects  participants  from  fraud.  API  services  will  provide  current
leaderboard  with  access  of  smart  contracts  based  on  current  user
scores. At the end of the competition, experts will test participants’
solutions with full competition data and publish final results.
20




2. MindSync platform contract. It will have users’ reputation data,
which can be upvoted or downvoted using upvote, downvote methods.
It  is  needed  for  integrity,  preventing  and  punishing  fraud,  and  to
create  a  fair  system  that  will  choose  best  experts  that  will  test
solutions, reach a consensus and arrive at fair results. Everyone’s vote
is scaled by their reputation. There will be list of experts, computation
power providers, IPFS nodes that can be used during contests. Each
user can become expert, provider, node, if his reputation rating is high
enough (e.g. one of ~100 first best ratings).
3. MAI token contract which will store platform users balances and
where   MAI   tokens   will   go   as   competition   prizes   or   fees   for
experts/providers services.
4.5 Validation
MindSync provides a system for guaranteeing the reliability of data,
decisions, rating information and other platform data by calculating
and storing their hash sums in the blockchain. At any time, anyone can
check  this  data  and  prove  the  integrity  and  timestamp  of  platform
entity without depending on a trusted third-party. Hence, there is no
need to trust any authority or middlemen.
4.6 Privacy protection
Paid  datasets  and  ML-models  in  the  market  are  protected  by
encryption with an asymmetric key. The public key and hash value is
stored in the blockchain for verification.
A unique private key for each object in the market is transferred to the
buyer after the payment is made.
21




4.7 Private services
MindSync AI solutions can run on either the MindSync platform or be
deployed  on  the  customer’s  servers  or  private  cloud.  MindSync
platform will contain components for rapid deployment of ready-made
solutions on the customer side.
