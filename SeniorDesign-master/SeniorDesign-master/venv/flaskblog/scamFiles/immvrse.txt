ImmVRse is a decentralised website, iOS and android application which utilises a standard Ethereum based ERC20
token to create its own eco-system. Therefore it is neither considered nor classified as a crypto-asset. Although
tokens are designed to be traded in multiple exchanges across the globe, this does not necessarily provide a
guarantee or an immediate increase of price. The sale of the tokens constitutes the distribution of a fully legal
web and mobile application under the laws of the United Kingdom. ImmVRse will be treated and utilised as a DAPP
TOKEN and will respectively be integrated as a form of payment. This whitepaper should be used for general
understanding of the concept and does not constitute nor intend to provide any form of professional investment
advice to the contributors either new or experienced in the world of cryptocurrency. Anyone willing to participate
in ImmVRse ICO will therefore independently be required to understand the risks and implications. Details of terms

EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY
ImmVRse will be the firﬆ decentralized and diﬆributed digital
video  platform  that  will  allow  content  creators,  brands  and
advertisers around the world to collaborate and produce the beﬆ
of what Virtual Reality has to offer. The platform will employ its
own unique digital currency aptly known as ImmVRse token,
which will be form of payment between all parties within the
ecosyﬆem. Using cryptographic signatures, the application will
be able to mirror file locations and record transactions across
multiple nodes to ensure data and transactional records within
the blockchain cannot be altered retroactively.
ImmVRse will focus primarily on VR/AR/Mixed reality and is
easily scalable to embrace other forms of media production such
as, 3D animation. Currently, there is no other platform providing
the  ability  to  showcase  VR  content  and  allowing  direct
employment as a result.




VISION
We ﬆrongly believe that Virtual Reality will play a significant part in our lives during the next decade. This
will come in many different forms and affect a wide range of business segments. Already, we are seeing
huge transformations in the medical, gaming, manufacturing and educational sectors where subﬆantial
inveﬆments have been made in both hardware and software. The demand for specific and quality
content  unlocks  opportunities  for  creative,  collaborative  and  contribution  of  VR  production,  thus
gradually revolutionising the virtual reality induﬆry as a whole.
We are confident that blockchain will provide the chance to create a more secure and transparent
platform for a new generation of VR content creators, permitting them to showcase their work to a global
reach of businesses, from ﬆart-ups all the way up to big corporations. Smart contracts in conjunction
with cryptocurrency will inevitably improve upon the current payment methods by adding the missing
layer of truﬆ and drive real values for all members of the Eco-syﬆem.
Our long-term vision is to become one of the largeﬆ decentralised creative platforms; a self-suﬆaining
and autonomous network that utilises a personalised cryptocurrency as a tradable commodity.
WHAT IS VIRTUAL REALITY?
Virtual Reality (VR) is the umbrella term for all immersive experiences created using real-world content,
purely artificial content or a hybrid of both. Within this, there are 4 core types:
- 360° Video
- Computer Generated VR (CGVR)
- Augmented Reality (AR)
- Mixed Reality (AR)
360° VIDEO
360-degree videos are video recordings where a view in every direction is
recorded at the same time. Real world content is filmed using an
omni-directional camera or a collection of cameras, to allow viewing from
every angle.
COMPUTER GENERATED VIRTUAL REALITY (CGVR)
Computer Generated Virtual Reality (CGVR) is essentially the
synthetic version of a 360-degree video. Immersive content
is created using computer rendered images.
AUGMENTED REALITY (AR)
Augmented reality (AR) is an overlay of content on
the real world, but that content is not anchored to
or part of it. The real-world content and the CG
content are not able to respond to each other.
MIXED REALITY (MR)
Mixed reality (MR) is an overlay of synthetic
content on the real world that is anchored to
and interacts with the real world. The key
characteriﬆic of MR is that the synthetic content and the real-world
content are able to react to each other in real time.




BUSINESS  APPLICATIONS
OF VR
VR technology is rapidly transforming how business is conducted and is due to become the next biggeﬆ
marketplace in consumer technology. The momentous leap towards the future will revolutionise the art
of interacting with the world around us.
Facebook, Google, Microsoft, HTC, Samsung are juﬆ a few of the companies that have manufactured
VR headsets and are ﬆriving for continuously improving quality, which can be seen by the huge
inveﬆments in research and development by major global corporations.
Forecaﬆs by Goldman Sachs indicates that the VR technology has the capability to grow into a $90
billion induﬆry by 20251.
When Mark Zuckerberg inveﬆed $2 billion into a VR ﬆart up in 2014, only a handful of people believed
in the potential of virtual reality2. Since then, we have experienced the achievements of multiple
mileﬆones in the development of VR, as technology giants swiftly move into this disruptive induﬆry.
Oculus Rift, Samsung VR and HTC Vive were some of more notable headsets that have been released
in the recent years.
Experts believe that the induﬆry will outgrow expectations in the next five years. It is also predicted that
almoﬆ every household will own a pair of virtual reality headsets as the concept will gradually infiltrate
a number of induﬆries.
The increasing popularity of virtual reality has now created a high demand for more 360-degree videos.
Here are some of the induﬆries that are utilising VR in some capacity:
HEALTHCARE
Virtual reality has multiple applications for healthcare. One use, which is not entirely new, is the use of
VR in therapy. For example, psychiatriﬆs at the University of Louisville use VR in cognitive behaviour
therapy to treat patients with social anxieties or phobias such as flying, public speaking and heights.
The controlled environment allows doctors to expose their patients to simulations and direct them on
how to cope with how they are feeling.
EDUCATION
Producing training videos to assiﬆ in learning in schools as well as in the job training for professionals,
VR has seen huge growth in this sector. The military has also inveﬆed in VR material as part of their
recruitment campaigns.

TOURISM
Many hotels have begun offering tours around their resorts using VR. Marriott Hotel unveiled an
advertising campaign named “The Teleporter” in 2015, where gueﬆs were given the opportunity to
explore the beaches of Hawaii and London’s Tower 42 in a cuﬆom-made special effects booth3. Gueﬆs
were provided with a virtual headset that took them to their desired deﬆination for 100 seconds. The 4D
technology meant that users were not only able to see but also feel the environment around them,
allowing holiday-goers to explore different locations before making a booking.
ADVERTISING
As more companies are shifting towards virtual reality, big brands are ﬆarting to produce their own VR
advertisements. The ﬆrong attraction that VR holds towards advertising is its ability when presented
effectively to completely immerse its audience into an experience thus allowing brands to emphasize
their intended individual message. VR also results in a much deeper emotional impact than regular
advertisement could be capable of, lending itself to a much higher level of engagement.
YouTube has already launched a dedicated VR channel, which can be viewed using any commercial
VR  headset  including  Google  cardboard.  In  turn,  this  will  require  companies  to  produce  VR
advertisements to complement the contents being produced.
FILMS AND CONTENTS
One of the moﬆ attractive features of VR is being able to completely revolutionise the way a ﬆory is
told. VR has the potential to dramatically enrich the cinematic experience for audiences everywhere,
thruﬆing them directly into the midﬆ of the action and allowing them to exiﬆ outside of their personal
realities for inﬆance changing their persona or even their gender. VR enables users to “live” the ﬆory
from the perspective of a character within the film, inﬆead of simply feeling like an observer in a dark
theatre or room.
The Cannes film feﬆival this year showcased a VR film created by Oscar-winning director Alejandro
G.Iñárritu “Carne y Arena”, a six-minute piece about a group of Latin immigrants crossing the border
through  the Arizona  desert,  where  they  are  then  caught  by  the  U.S.  authorities.  The  audience
experienced the film in a sand-ﬆrewn space the size of a few basketball courts, in order to simulate a
desert, accompanied by an Oculus headset4.

MARKET SCALE
FORECASTS
Virtual reality is currently eﬆimated to be a  $1.6 billion market, of which moﬆ of the HMD  (head
mounted displays) are smartphone-based devices such as Google cardboard, due to lowers coﬆs and
availability. Although it compromises quality, price point is a very important factor for VR end users. VR
headsets such as Oculus, Vive and PlayStation VR, three of the biggeﬆ current players on the market,
will account for an eﬆimated 3 million units in 2017 and will increase to 5 million in 20185.
Research conducted by business Insider shows positive forecaﬆs for virtual reality. BI Intelligence
(2016) ﬆates that the adoption of VR and AR headsets will grow slowly after the launch of mobile and
PC VR, followed by mainﬆream adoption of ﬆand-alone headsets6.   While research conducted by
Goldman Sachs shows exponential growth, as the total revenue for VR software induﬆry will grow from
$28 billion in 2020 to $79 billion in 2025, as the combined hardware and software revenue will grow to
$90 billion7.
While early adopters will drive the initial wave of purchasing, sustainable growth will likely come from VR
and AR app developers building a robust and engaging ecosystem of content that entices slower
adopters. Lastly, as the underlying technology powering these devices increases, so too will the
capabilities, creating new use cases in entertainment, workplaces, and education.

In the research paper, Boland (2016) purports that beyond gaming, the VR entertainment induﬆry will
ﬆart developing once demand for VR headsets increases. Advertisements featured in virtual reality will
have better view through rates. That is why many other induﬆries are ﬆarting to adopt virtual reality,
including travel agencies, e-commerce merchants and blue chip brands8.
According to research data by Tractica (2016), hardware and content companies will be banking on the
ﬆrong consumer intereﬆ in Virtual Reality. Consequently, experts predict that over 150 million headsets
will be sold between 2019 and 2020. With the ever-increasing use of Virtual Reality technology, it’s only
a matter of time before it becomes a common household item9.
Virtual reality content research organisation Superdata Research (2017) concludes that worldwide VR
revenue will reach $28.3 billion, with an indication that the growth will ﬆart picking up by 2019. VR
consumer software and services sales will further fuel this growth by $16.2 billion10.

As the demand for virtual reality and head mounted display surges,
the subsequent demand for content will also increase. This is where
ImmVRse ﬆeps in as the marketplace will help suﬆain the growth
of VR content development in marketing, entertainment and media
induﬆries. The content creators in ImmVRse will offer an array of
VR  content  types,  such  as  entertainment  contents,  VR  vlogs,
corporate introductions, VR music contents etc.




CURRENT PROBLEMS
COMPLEXITIES WITH CONTENT DISTRIBUTION
Multiple platforms have VR support including YouTube and Facebook, however, there are not enough
content creators on any one platform. Current media sharing platforms are dominated by  180/2D
content with only a few top tier influencers being compensated well. Unfortunately expensive cameras
are discouraging the new generation of content producers, thereby reducing the volume available for
users. In addition, the lack of copyright protection againﬆ the reproduction of content does little to
encourage and ﬆimulate growth in VR production. The end result favours only a handful of VR content
and animation creators who are able to dominate the field.
Given the fact that the marketplace for traditional content producers are wholly saturated, it is very
difficult to feed the growth of VR without more dedicated platforms. The current offerings are however
flawed in many respects with moﬆ being centralised and with limitation of approval. That is, not all the
content creators will be approved on the platform, a decision which is retained by the platforms
themselves.
PAYMENT MODEL
There are currently many countries in the world where users are bound by legislative reﬆrictions in
regards  to  payments.  The  decentralised  model  overcomes  these  hurdles  by  implementing  a
ﬆandardised approach to digital payment transactions. By providing a blockchain payment integration,
ImmVRse will allow anyone in the world to create a wallet within seconds and use it to make and
receive payments.
REVENUE GENERATION
Due to massive influx of content producers on platforms such as YouTube and Vimeo, a subﬆantial
amount of effort or an extraordinary idea is necessary for a producer to ﬆand out and subsequently
generate revenue from their respective production.
SLOW GROWTH
It is inevitable that the growth of VR and AR requires the involvement of media and entertainment
content producers. Due to Head Mounted Display units being forecaﬆed to increase, the demand for
content production will rise exponentially.
IMM                                                                                                        S E




SOLUTION
TO THE PROBLEM
Blockchain is at the forefront of a new digital revolution that has caught the world by ﬆorm. In essence,
blockchain is a decentralised network and digital ledger for transactions, which can be programmed to
ﬆore all types of valuable data and also has no single point of failure.
ImmVRse  will  be  powered  by  a  web  infraﬆructure  built  on  the  foundation  of  blockchain  called
Ethereum. This is a marketplace that allows smart contracts to be diﬆributed as well as decentralised
applications to be developed and run without the influence of a central arbitrator, downtime, fraud or
any external interference.
CREATIVITY - ImmVRse will not only provide a common marketplace for general users, advertisers
and businesses, but also a community where members can interact, help and inspire each other. By
using the power of a decentralised network, we will create an efficient and self-suﬆaining ecosyﬆem for
our members.
CONTROL  - Control and the power of sharing will be shifted towards the community to remove
centralised decision making and removing third party or middlemen from the workflow. ImmVRse will
not  act  as  a  mediator  or  intermediary.  Every  job  will  use  the  functions  of  smart  contracts,  the
parameters of which will be set by the users on both sides, e.g. brands and the content creators. The
contract will be deployed on the blockchain and payments will be processed based on set deadlines
agreed between parties. The syﬆem of contracting will therefore function similar to a peer-to-peer hiring
syﬆem.
PAYMENT - Payment is one of the biggeﬆ problems that blockchain will solve via this application.
Firﬆly, there are no high transaction fees, requirement for bank accounts or any other reﬆrictions for
users. Using ImmVRse tokens, it will take seconds to send and receive payments anywhere around the
world without paying a high processing fee to a bank or a third party money transfer. This will open
opportunities  to  millions  of  content  creators  in  many  countries  where  the  citizens  prefer  using
cryptocurrencies  due  to  geographical  and  adminiﬆrative  reﬆrictions  imposed  by  their  country’s
legislative authority. Additionally, the users will be moderated using a sophiﬆicated autonomous ID
verification syﬆem. Once the users are verified, the payments will be made using ImmVRse tokens.
REVENUE - ImmVRse will allow creators to attract lucrative contracts from employers, as well as
creating cuﬆomised content for companies and high profile global brands. Besides, the syﬆem has
been designed to not only reward creators, but also the jobseekers who will be incentivised using
tokens for interacting with the application. Additionally, high-value freelancers will pay a monthly fee to
the  marketplace  for  maintaining  their  premium  ﬆatus.  By  creating  a  balanced  ecosyﬆem,  the
marketplace will aim to become one of the largeﬆ marketplace for VR/AR professionals, thus attracting
hundreds of companies around the world. The combination of all the above will contribute to ensuring
the rapid growth of users and content. This in turn will attract advertisers to inveﬆ into the marketplace
to the benefit of all within the ecosyﬆem.




BUSINESS
MODEL
TYPE OF BUSINESS
ImmVRse is a mix of B2C and B2B, connected & decentralised
blockchain based markeplace, where VR content producers are
able to showcase their talents to a broad audience. Brands can
hire content producers and also directly advertise to users on the

-Adrian Chan, Head of Marketing




ImmVRse
IN DETAIL




ImmVRse Network is a network architecture that consiﬆs of:
ImmVRse Token
ImmVRse Wallet
ImmVRse Protocol
ImmVRse (ĐApp)
ImmVRse Decentralised Engine
User Retention Engine
The core component of the network will be based on Ethereum Metropolis. This enables the syﬆem to
initiate smart contracts. Every transaction and contracts will be channelled through this platform.
IMVR TOKEN
The bespoke token for the network has been created as a centralised currency to be used within the
ImmVRse Network. Users are currently able to purchase and sell ImmVRse tokens in exchanges. The
token follows the ﬆandards of Ethereum ERC-20.
PROTOCOL
The protocol is a fundamental feature to the business. ImmVRse formed partnership with Origin Protocol
to build the syﬆem on an open, transparent protocol and move to the market faﬆer.
ImmVRse (ĐApp)
This is the decentralised VR application where brands can directly hire content creators. This platform
also  allows  companies  to  advertise  and  users  to  interact  and  subsequently  receive  rewards  for
interacting with the application.
ImmVRse DECENTRALISED ENGINE
This is a solidity based algorithm on blockchain that is at the very core of powering ImmVRse ĐApp. The
syﬆem is being developed to connect ImmVRse Token, ImmVRse ĐApp and all of its users within the
platform.
ImmVRse USER RETENTION ENGINE
This is an algorithm for blockchain, designed specifically to retain users within the ecosyﬆem. The
blockchain  algorithm  enables  users  to  directly  engage  with  content  creaotrs  and  users  of  the
marketplace by earning reward badges. Furthermore, the syﬆem will be designed to reward the users
for simply interacting with the application. A portion of advertiser’s payment will be diﬆributed to the
users for interacting, sharing and voting on the app.




IMM                                                                                                            S E
DISTRIBUTED APPLICATION FUNCTION
The ImmVRse application will have the following characteriﬆics in order to be decentralised:
The  application  will  built  entirely  on  open-sourced  blockchain  protocol                                (Origin)  and  function
autonomously without any mediation from a financial controller
The DApp will allow users to create an Ethereum address and wallet within the application, resulting
in a direct connection to the Ethereum mainnet
The DApp's data and records of operation will be cryptographically ﬆored in a public, decentralized
blockchain so as to avoid any central points of failure
The application will use a cryptographic ERC20 token as a form of payment to initiate smart contracts
between two parties, enabling a peer to peer hiring process without third-party mediation
The token will also be used to make a payment to the users, using algorithms on the blockchain that
will allow users to be rewarded and thus resulting in better user adoption
The syﬆem may adapt its protocol in response to proposed improvements and market feedback.
ImmVRse will permit content creators around the world to showcase their talent to users, brands, advertisers
and businesses on one platform. The brands or companies can then directly hire content creators, using the
application and Ethereum’s smart contract deployment to pay media producers. ImmVRse token works as a
sole  tradable  currency  within  the  application  and  ecosyﬆem.  With  the  token  being  tradable  and
exchangeable in many various exchanges, the increased use of the token will subsequently booﬆ the future
valuation of the token.
The recent growth of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology has completely shaken the fintech and
banking world to its core. Cryptocurrency is currently the neweﬆ form of crowdfunding which uses “Initial
Coin Offerings” and applications hoﬆed on decentralised networks. As more people are gradually ﬆarting to
adopt virtual currencies, crowdfunding is shifting to a new paradigm.
ImmVRse has built its own personalised cryptocurrency - ImmVRse token (IMVR), which will be used to raise
funds for the company. The token is connected to the mobile ĐApp as a tradable commodity by the users.




CONVERGING VR AND BLOCKCHAIN
ImmVRse aims to be a marketplace free of any reﬆrictions, as creators
and freelancers are able to publish whatever content they would like,
whenever they want, in whatever form they wish. However, there are
moderators that will intervene in extreme or significant cases of
inappropriate content.
We are aware that without a specific syﬆem in place for
independent creators, it will eventually become extremely difficult
for them to compete with mainﬆream giants. The DApp’s
algorithm will be designed to address this particular issue. The
syﬆem provides an equal opportunity for both new and
experienced content creators. As an autonomous application, the
syﬆem values amateur content creators the same way popular
content creators will be valued, so that everyone may
have their share of the spotlight.
The idea behind blockchain is to craft an extraordinarily powerful and secure application
on a decentralised system that allows developers to build self-governing applications, a
system that is powered by the people. By developing a dedicated marketplace for VR
experts where a public voting system is in place, ImmVRse aims to fulfil the initial
vision of the decentralised blockchain founders, in creating a democratic platform with
no external interference.
Limon, Co-Founder & CIO, VRtualise.




BLOCKCHAIN’S CORE FUNCTIONALITY
ImmVRse will be hoﬆed on a hybrid decentralised marketplace. Decentralised platform is where
computer servers or otherwise known as “nodes” are connected to each other from different parts of the
world, in order to run the smart contracts on the application. This allows the syﬆem to remain both
public and encrypted via blockchain.
Using ImmVRse, companies can transparently and directly hire VR professionals on the platform
without the need for an arbitrary third party. A smart contract application holds a specific amount of
currency and locks it in an escrow, until a given date or goal is reached. Therefore, the brands have the
opportunity to make payments based on results, which will either be released to the creators, or safely
returned back to the brands. The intelligent protocol on Ethereum blockchain is designed to process
any transactions within the application, allowing ImmVRse to be self-suﬆaining.
The core architecture has three components that provides the foundation for the syﬆem
-                                                                                                           ImmVRse Token (an ERC-20 token)
-                                                                                                           ImmVRse Network - a blockchain based marketplace
-                                                                                                           User Retention Engine - a syﬆem that balances the supply of currency
ERC TOKEN ON SMART CONTRACTS
Users will be able to receive or spend ImmVRse tokens, our own personalised cryptocurrency for the
ImmVRse Network. ImmVRse token will be tradeable and exchangeable in various crypto exchanges
around the world. Users can send or receive ImmVRse tokens and simultaneously ﬆore them in their
ImmVRse Wallet. The syﬆem is open sourced, similar to tracking contract deployment on etherscan.io,
and therefore will be very transparent.
NETWORK FILE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
On a typical hypertext transfer protocol, cloud ﬆorage files are protected by replicating data and ﬆoring
identical data in multiple deﬆinations. This increases coﬆ of web ﬆorage significantly. Unlike typical
cloud ﬆorage, ImmVRse will use IPFS, a radical new file ﬆorage syﬆem specifically designed for
blockchain that will remove duplication of data and ﬆoring information on decentralised nodes.
IPFS, or interplanetary File Syﬆem replaces the file duplication syﬆem of the hypertext transfer
protocol ﬆorage. Each content, e.g. an image file uploaded on the syﬆem, as well as all blocks within
the file are provided with a diﬆinctive fingerprint called “cryptographic hash”. The ﬆructure doesn’t
require  the  data  to  be  duplicated  or  ﬆored  in  numerous  databases.  Inﬆead,  it  replicates  the
cryptographic signature and mirrors its data.
In addition, the algorithm enables nodes around the world to ﬆore and index relevant content. When
ImmVRse users look up profiles, the application requeﬆs the network to find the nodes that ﬆores
content. IPFS also provides a blockchain search engine that allows a user to locate IDs and profiles,
similar to the way users would find data on a ﬆandard http search engine.




FAIL-SAFE NETWORK STORAGE
ImmVRse network diﬆribution syﬆem  (INDS) along with IPFS will track signatures and as many
cryptographic replications as possible. Given the current situation of blockchain, it is difficult to track the
total number of signatures, however the majority of them will be sufficient to guarantee non-redundancy
as the data will be immutable.
CACHE STORAGE
Unlike a typical web ﬆorage facility where initial ﬆreaming is slowed down due to high latency and ping
time, ImmVRse has plans to deploy a syﬆem where cache will be ﬆored to the closeﬆ available
address, if the project is fully funded. This will save bandwidth, decrease latency and ping time.
The overall architecture will be designed to be everlaﬆing, immutable and coﬆ effective. As the address
is mirrored in hundreds of thousands of places around the world, taking down one or a hundred nodes
will not result in overall syﬆem downtime.
Blockchain is still susceptible to slow TPS and higher loading time therefore development
of this feature will be depedent on the scalability of the network.

APPLICATION INTERFACE DESIGN
Creators, advertisers and brands begin by selecting their respective profile types. Brands and
advertisers are unable to upload Contents through their profiles, they can only interact with Contents
and  hire  content  creators.  However,  brands  may  poﬆ  their  job  openings  onto  the  site  while
advertisers, on top of recruiting content creators, may also poﬆ ads directly within the application’s
syﬆem.
A subﬆantial part of our interface is ensuring brands and advertisers have the transparency to select
any content creator they see fit. However, a syﬆem is in place to help them find a specialiﬆ creator
that they may be looking for, which is where our awards and creator badge syﬆems comes into play.

TOKEN
ImmVRse Token  (IMVR) will be a form of tradeable token  (currency) within the ImmVRse
ecosyﬆem. The diﬆribution of the flow in and out of the syﬆem is balanced by a range of users
within the network.
Brands who wish to hire content creators using the marketplace are required to purchase the
ImmVRse token, in order to pay for their services. On the other end, creators receive the
payment that they can later exchange to fiat currencies using various exchanges. Funds are held
and locked into smart contracts without the interference of a financial controller. Once the
content creator has achieved their objective, the funds are released, failing which, returned
safely back to its original source.
Having a dedicated token for the Ecosyﬆem provides a number of benefits, including but not
limited to:
Using the currency across                                                                         Facilitating various forms of    Making it possible to

*Users will need to achieve accolades, e.g. “Liked 100 Posts” or “Posted 500 Comments” etc. and get paid in real currency.
**Payments received by ImmVRse will be processed straightaway, however, until the users complete their achievement, they
will not receive any payment.




ImmVRse USER RETENTION ENGINE
The User Retention Engine has been designed specifically to balance the circulation supply of
ImmVRse tokens, in order to ﬆabilise any unpredicted volatility. The application will attract casual
users - users who can simply sign up and use the application, similar to YouTube. Users are able to
like, comment and share their contents. By interacting with the app, the users are rewarded with a
small portion of ImmVRse tokens.
The flow of payment is controlled using smart contracts and the syﬆem takes a percentage of
advertiser’s payment, holding it in escrow until the T&Cs are met. Once the creator has completed
the task, they are paid in the form of ImmVRse tokens. The tokens can then be ﬆored in their
ImmVRse Wallet or sold in an exchange with any other crypto or fiat currencies.
AWARD SYSTEM
In order to incentivise the user on ImmVRse, they earn a small share of ImmVRse tokens as a token
of appreciation for the recurring use of our marketplace. These tokens can then be accumulated to
be exchanged for real monetary awards, or to make purchases within the application that will be
made available in the future.
Users on ImmVRse receive tokens as a reward for interacting with the application. The proportion of
the funds they receive is set by smart contracts and can be adjuﬆed based on their activity heat
map.
The users need to achieve certain accolades or complete defined tasks to unlock and receive
earned tokens. If the user does not complete the task defined by the smart contracts, the funds
remain locked in the blockchain.
The users are able to exchange the token with fiat currencies at selected exchanges or alternatively
ﬆored in their ImmVRse wallet.

MONTHLY CREATOR AWARDS
Blockchain smart contracts automatically trigger a monthly awards syﬆem, where users are able to
vote for their favourite contents under multiple categories. Under each content is a voting button,
which allows the user to select the content to be entered into the monthly awards selection, under the
specific category it falls within.
Monthly award winners are selected by smart contract, based on the contents that have received the
majority of votes at the end of each calendar month. Award winners are able to accumulate these
categorical awards and gradually progress into a higher tier of our creator rankings, in addition to
receiving a generous share of ImmVRse Coins that can be added to their wallet. The algorithm is
designed to filter the moﬆ voted content and award the creator with a fixed amount of ImmVRse
Coins.
As our marketplace places emphasis on providing an opportunity for independent creators to flourish,
it is worth noting that corporate companies are not eligible for this award. The more quality contents
produced and accolades won by a creator, the increased attention they will draw from brands and
advertisers.
ENDORSEMENT BADGES
Endorsement badges are a way for companies and brands to recognize creators for the successful
completion of a project. The creators automatically receive an endorsement badge from a company
when they successfully complete a project and receive cleared funds. These badges indicate the
amount of business related projects creators have completed, thereby allowing companies to filter
creators out in terms of business related experience.
CREATORS BADGES
In order to aid the selection process for brands and businesses looking to hire content creators, the
application has implemented a creator badge syﬆem as a measure of their experience and quality of
work, which is displayed in their Creator’s Trophy Case. Content creators that put significant effort into
their work can find themselves quickly moving up the syﬆem, achieving more recognition, which in
turn opens up further and potentially better business opportunities.
The badge syﬆem ensures that content creators recognise that they are progressing in their careers
and with mounting projects being completed, the higher their pay-out. Creators will ﬆart off with zero
badges, but with every upload and accolade achieved, they will be able to quickly develop.
Creators also receive a share of ImmVRse tokens for every tier they reach, with each amount being
greater than the previous. As they progress through the ranks, creators are given the option to
increase their minimum coﬆs for their services if they wish, for example, a platinum creator would be
eligible to set their minimum coﬆ much higher than a silver creator.
Every tier represents a new challenge for the creator, as they thrive to reach the diamond tier, where
they will be recognized as one of the elite creators on the marketplace. Diamond creators will also
have an opportunity to make an influence in the direction of the marketplace moving forward, as they
will be invited to attend the exclusive annual ImmVRse creators’ summit.
The entire reward syﬆem functions under Ethereum’s algorithm, which inherently reduces human
error, so as to provide content creators the beﬆ chance to receive these rewards via a totally
transparent process.

As VR is at an early innovative ﬆage, the technology ﬆill has a long way to go before it
becomes a household item. The ﬆart-up or innovative ﬆage consiﬆs of the marketing of a new
service, which is where ImmVRse currently ﬆands.
At this ﬆage, information on products and services are limited and consumers have ﬆill much
to learn about the business.
The growth ﬆage is where demand ﬆarts to rise rapidly and consumers begin to underﬆand
the value of the new services that are offered by a business. One of the moﬆ important
components of this ﬆage is research and development, along with the marketing of services.
We would like our contributors to join us in this exciting ﬆage and together, experience the
growth  of  the  business  from  research  projects  to  the  development  of  our  revolutionary
blockchain marketplace.




PRIVACY AND
SECURITY




Blockchain provides a highly secure syﬆem to share and ﬆore information. This marketplace allows
us to execute secure end-to-end encrypted transactions that can serve as a defense ﬆructure in
preventing cyber attacks and security threats.
PROTECTING DATA
Moﬆ public key infraﬆructures are centralised and dependent on third party certification authorities,
which is why it’s easy to compromise identities and access data. As IFPS mirrors data on cloud,
blockchain cryptography is decentralised and therefore has no single point of failure.
As a result of the diﬆributed ledger, running ImmVRse on blockchain eliminate the risks of false key
propagation and securely verifies the identification of the user. Furthermore, as the network is
dependent on millions of floating nodes across the world, it ensures that a ﬆrong defense syﬆem is
in place to be able to withﬆand DDoS attacks.
EXTREMELY SECURE TRANSACTIONS
Every  transaction  on  the  ImmVRse  marketplace  will  be  executed  using  the  smart  contract
application.  This  is  the  same  technology  that  enables  peer-to-peer  secure  transactions  and
subsequently prevents and reduces cyberattacks e.g. DDoS.
SYSTEM INTEGRITY
All  transactions  within  the  application  will  be  processed  using  the  peer-to-peer  automated
identification syﬆem built into ImmVRse Token’s code. That is why the transactions are executed
exactly as the protocol commands, without the interference of a third party.
ImmVRse LEDGER
All transactions will be logged onto the blockchain ledger, decluttering complications and increasing
efficiency. The open smart contract explorer on ethereum will allow users to track addresses,
therefore eliminating privacy and complying with the ethical implications of blockchain.
PROTECTING DATA INTEGRITY
Signing secure contracts is a fundamental building block within the ImmVRse infraﬆructure. All the
contracts signed on ImmVRse ĐApp are completed using blockchain’s smart contract syﬆem,
diﬆributing evidence across multiple blockchain nodes and making it impossible to manipulate from
a central data source. Should any manipulation of data be identified, it is immediately discovered as
the original hash exiﬆs on millions of nodes. Data control will be a critical part of the process, along
with securing any project proposals that are deemed as trade secrets.
DISTRIBUTED DNS
ImmVRse also has plans to integrate the concept of a diﬆributed DNS syﬆem, which carries a
minimal risk of failure under an excess of requeﬆs.




REVENUE AND
PROFITABILITY
As advertisers and brands are recruiting content creators directly without the interference of a third party,
they will be typically saving a significant amount of money. The coﬆ of hiring content creators should
range between $3,000 to $50,000, depending on their badge tier, experience and specifications.

Once content creators reach the golden creator tier and have made a considerable amount of profit from
their work with brands and companies, a charge will be implemented per month and will increase as they
continue to rank up. Golden tier creators will be charged $5.99 a month, Platinum tier creators will be
charged $7.99 a month and Diamond tier creators $10.99 per month.
Due to the exponential rise of demand in virtual reality content in the recent years and the forecaﬆed rise
in years to come, this is a perfect opportunity for ImmVRse to eﬆablish itself as the moﬆ prominent
marketplace online for virtual reality content diﬆribution. This in turn will lead to generating opportunities
and subsequent value increase of the company.




IMM                                                                                                   S E
ACADEMY
As many users on the marketplace will be new to virtual reality, we want to provide individuals
with the opportunity to not only become part of the community as users but also as paid content
creators. ImmVRse Academy will be a separate application which aims to be a comprehensive
learning component integrated into the overall ImmVRse ecosyﬆem, teaching users that are
intereﬆed in VR content creation how to film and produce professional VR content. If the project
is fully funded, the token will be used to provide Proof-of-Access to the users on the marketplace.
To become a member of ImmVRse Academy, the monthly coﬆ will coﬆ $12.99 and this will give
ﬆudents access to live webinars, a number of tutorial videos with experienced VR content
creators, as well as a private channel to communicate and get feedback from them on any
projects they may be working on. Students will be taught everything about required equipment,
filming and poﬆ production process.
ImmVRse Academy hopes to inspire a new generation of VR content creators and provide every-
one, regardless of their experience, the opportunity to begin a career as a VR content creator, or
perhaps even simply, to generate a secondary source of revenue.




DEVELOPMENT
PROCESS
Launch of Marketing Campaign: Our marketing campaign for token launch
was luanched on the firﬆ week of 2018. We had over 3000 whiteliﬆ application
on the firﬆ week of launch.
PR & Roadshow: Our marketing campaign for token launch was luanched on
the firﬆ week of 2018. We had over 3000 whiteliﬆ application on the firﬆ week
of launch. As a part of the campaign, we formed partnership with Knect365 and
signed up to participate in over 3 blockchain summit across Europe.
Phase 1
Pre ICO: A private sale was conducted in April 2018 with contributors who
were willing to contribute over 10 Ether.
ICO Launch: ICO will be launched on the 7th July after a short Pre-ICO
in June. ImmVRse aimed to release 100,000,000 IMVRs.
Token  Release:  ImmVRse  tokens  was  released  in  one  or  more
exchanges upon the successful completion of the ICO. Some exchanges
may be confirmed prior to the ICO, however, the official date of token
transfer was 14 September 2018. Deadline for ICO token claims were set
to be 20 October.
Exchange Integration: After long periods of negotiations, IMVR was
liﬆed on multiple exchanges. Once of the firﬆ three exchanges to liﬆ
IMVR was DDEX, Token Store and also CCore Exchange.
Bounty Diﬆribution: ImmVRse bounty campaign had an overwhelming 7500
participants. Thanks to Arteezy Management Team, bounty campaign ended
successfully. Bounty diﬆribution is ﬆill underway as of 16 October 2018 and
aimed to be completed by the end of October.
Marketing Campaign: A crucial part of the plan is positive PR and marketing as
the success of the application will heavily depend on the adoption and retention of
users. On this basis, we have decided to allocate a certain amount of reserved
tokens towards the PR and marketing campaign of IMVR and the product.




Partnerships: ImmVRse aims to form multiple partnership and reserved IMVR
tokens to reward future IMVR trader and DApp users. In addition to partner with
multiple exchanges, ImmVRse aims to form more partnership with other ﬆartups
in   the   blockchain   world,   which   would   be   mutually   beneficial.   More
announcement will come during Q4 2018.
Phase 2
ImmVRse Alpha Launch: ImmVRse is aiming to launch the alpha version of the
app by Q1 2018.
ImmVRse Ecosyﬆem Setup: Upon the release of ImmVRse DApp demo,
ImmVRse tokens will be usable within the application ecosyﬆem. We aim to
release multiple application with ImmVRse ecosyﬆem.
Continued Research and Development: ImmVRse will continue to conduct
R&D with universities across the country to enable ﬆudents’ participation in
blockchain technology. A part of the process will be to recruit PhD ﬆudents and
dedicated researchers to improve VR/MR/AR technologies based on blockchain
marketplaces.
ImmVRse Full Version Launch: The full version of the application will be
launched by mid-2019 after extensive teﬆing on the beta version. ImmVRse
aims to launch and marketplace for creators and brands, as this will coincide
Phase 3
with the year that Facebook, Intel and Apple
will also be launching their own commercial
VR  headsets.  Once  this  happens,  mass
adoption  will  take  place,  creating  an
extremely high demand for VR content.
ImmVRse  may  change  categories  and
limitations  to  marketplace,  however,  it
would be dependent on the acceptability
of the product in the market.
There are also plans to partner up with crypto economiﬆ, PR experts and full
marketing team for increasing and retaining our user base, including content
creators, users and recruiters. Extensive campaigns for market making and
application will be launched later in 2019.
