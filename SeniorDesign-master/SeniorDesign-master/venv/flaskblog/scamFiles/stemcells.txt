INTRODUCTION
Mission stateMent
Stem Cell Innovations focuses on
research and development in the field of
stem cell science, with the dual purposes
of furthering human longevity and
expanding access to stem cell treatments
through cutting-edge technology.
1.1 Stem Cell Innovations Background
Stem Cell Innovations (SCI) is a network of highly motivated
researchers, expert medical professionals, dedicated investors,
and innovative engineers working together to create a unique
platform that brings together two of the most life-changing
innovations of the 21st century: stem cell technology and
blockchain technology.
Since its initial founding in early 2013 under the name Camden
RAD, LLC, SCI has played a crucial role in stem cell research and
development around the world, and we has conducted our own
domestic and international case studies to further the research
in this exciting field. SCI’s activities in the field of stem cell
science have directly contributed to advancements in the field,        Stem CeLLS ARe A
as well as to new stem cell discoveries around the world.

1.2 Stem Cell Innovations Vision
Stem Cell Innovations is steadfast in its international research,
development, and implementation of stem cell therapy. We
work to expand our network with professionals, labs, clinics,
hospitals, and nonprofit organizations around the world to
further this research and development. our ultimate goal is to
connect people who need treatment with a dedicated team of
professionals who can provide personalized solutions based
on patient factors and demographics collected in our dual
blockchain-supported platform.
A lack of communication and access continues to plague the
medical community in many areas of the world. At SCI, we
believe such communication, access, and connections should
be convenient and available when needed, just as so many
other services are in modern society. With so much information
at our fingertips, it was only a matter of time before stem cell
research and treatment became mainstream and SCI is ready to
take research and treatment to the next level. Can you imagine a
world where every person, regardless of location, will be able to
connect with a doctor instantly? We did, and we are building the
Stem Cell Innovations Application (SCIApplication) in which such      ouR uLtImAte goAL IS to
transactions can occur. What’s more, the same connection will
facilitate determinations of how much information to share, who       ConneCt PeoPLe WHo
to share it with, and when based on a patient’s preferences.

our vision is to provide a safe storage solution for users’ medical
data and give those users control over their individual stem cell     A dEdicAtEd tEAm of
records. Data related to a user’s stem cell needs will be stored
PRofeSSIonALS WHo CAn
on the SCI blockchain. Such data will be accessible via our
secure application. With access to our application, users will

the SCIApplication and website will be in full compliance with
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996       CoLLeCteD In ouR DuAL
privacy regulations (HIPAA), and will keep user information
safe and secure. In case of an emergency, users will be able to       bLoCkCHAIn-SuPPoRteD

the SCIApplication on the user’s phone.                               PLAtfoRm.

Information, such as names and dosages of medications, as
well as previous surgeries and other medical information can
be crucial in an emergency situation. Such information will be
stored in the SCIApplication so that emergency care providers
can quickly access, understand, and provide needed medical
attention based on a user’s profile and accessible information.
In addition to providing secure access to a user’s medical
information, the SCIApplication will allow users to seamlessly
register for life insurance policies, bone marrow donor registries,
and organ donation registries. furthermore, the SCIApplication
will also enable users to access their individualized stem
cell profile, which will facilitate access to stem cell therapies
and services in a convenient and straightforward manner.
our goal is to bring stem cell therapies into the mainstream
medical community while providing harmonious access to
medical records for patients and their doctors. It is our vision
to empower patients and reduce inefficiency in their access to
medical care around the world.

STEM CELL INDUSTRY
OVERVIEW
2.1 Stem Cell Research
Stem cell therapies are drastically changing today’s available
options for surgery, medication, and physical therapy. With more
research, access, and consistent communication, more lives can
be changed for the better. medical professionals have a vast
array of options at their disposal when it comes to medicine,
treatments, and therapies thanks to research and case studies
done over the years, but there is still more work to be done.
many experienced medical professionals champion stem cells
as the next stage of evolution in medical care, and we couldn’t
agree more.
founder and Ceo of Avm biotechnology, Dr. theresa Deisher,
has this to say about stem cell research:
“Every person has stem cells in their own body . . . And while
there are exceptions, when we want to treat someone with a
disease, we can take their own stem cells and use their own
stem cells to induce regeneration and recovery in that patient.
That’s the value of adult stem cells. They’re safe. They work.
And they’re affordable.”1

“Without a doubt, stem cell research will lead to dramatic
improvement in the human condition and will benefit millions of
people.”
many countries have already moved beyond the research phases
related to cutting edge stem cell therapies including South
korea, Singapore, China, mexico, germany, Israel, ukraine,
Austria, turkey, thailand, India, Spain, and Switzerland.
With the discovery of stem cells dating back over 30 years, the
uses and benefits of stem cells have proven effective throughout
innovative studies and medical trials time and time again.
In 1968, the first bone marrow transplant was performed to
treat two siblings with severe combined immunodeficiency
successfully. other key events in stem cell research include the
following advancements and discoveries:
•                                                                     1978: Stem cells discovered in human cord blood.

Stem cells have the ability to regenerate, repair, and replenish
other cells, which provides hope for the possibility of replacing
diseased cells. the information gained through research and

different cell types, providing the opportunity for a broad range
of applications.
tissue-specified adult stem cells are limited in their application
in medical treatments, and more information is needed about
potential applications in the future.
Induced pluripotent stem cells can be reprogrammed by
scientists to match the tissue of specified adult stem cells which
mimic embryonic stem cells. Scientists hope that more research
related to induced pluripotent stem cells will allow doctors to
treat patients with regenerated stem cells from their own body.
there is also a potential for pluripotent stem cells to work to
prevent the immune system from rejecting organ transplants
following surgery.
Regardless of the type of stem cell, diverse application and
possibility remain at the forefront of research. Researchers
agree that stem cells may hold the key to human longevity,
but certainly hold the key to improved quality of life and they
provide a much-improved approach to treating diseases humans
face around the globe.

Stem cells can provide us with a unique approach to therapy
in a variety of conditions. We’re confident that such research
and advancement will continue to change the way the medical
community views many of the world’s most prevalent diseases.
2.4 Stem Cell Banking
one of the richest sources of stem cells is found on cord blood.
Cord blood is found in the umbilical cord and placenta after a
baby is delivered. the cells in this type of blood boosts
the immunity of both the mother and baby in preparation for
labor. being able to collect and store that blood for future use is
a growing trend in medicine. Cord blood banking (also known as
stem cell banking) is the process of collecting the cord blood and
cryogenically freezing its stem cells.
PAge 14




Stem cell banking allows parents to safeguard their children
against possible medical issues in the future by ensuring they
have access to their own pure stem cells, if needed. However,
the complexity and cost of the current stem cell banking options
present many barriers to parents who wish to take advantage of
this medical technology.
In addition to furthering research, SCI plans to offer stem cell
banking through its stem cell application ecosystem. Parents will

3.2 Stem Cell Innovations’ Dual Blockchain
SCI plans to run on dual blockchain platforms. the first platform will be built on an ethereum base for
token use only, and it will be powered by the eRC20 platform. the second blockchain will be a custom
application designed and built by SCI engineers tailored to fit the healthcare environment.
SCI has decided to build its own blockchain for storing and processing patient stem cell records. this
customized blockchain is known as SCIChain. SCIChain will use the Hyperledger fabric network, which will
be designed to use smart contracts to protect data and ensure only authorized individuals have access to user
data. SCI engineers realize that the Hyperledger fabric blockchain has unique functionalities that differ from
other blockchain types that fit with the needs of SCI’s vision and product.
Authorizations on the network are controlled by Hyperledger modeling which allows SCIApplication to
save a user’s stem cell record on the blockchain securely. SCIChain and SCIApplication operate vertically
while ensuring the integrity and security of the transactions.
SCI believes it can achieve integrity and security of data by using our proprietary unique identifier and
control languages. Credentials will also run vertically between the SCIChain and SCIApplication, ensuring
high-level authentication for professionals, providers, users, and all members of the SCI network.
Currently, SCI engineers are developing more ways to initiate faster, more secure connectivity between
SCIChain and SCIApplication, which will be released in subsequent versions. furthermore, SCI is working
on a broader project to create separate blockchains for different stem cell specialties, ensuring further
security of data across various fields of study.

Smart contracts are the gatekeepers of the SCIApplication.
users will be free to change their settings at will should their
treatments change or preferences change. using mathematical
equations equal to the eRC20 platform, SCI ensures user
privacy. the straightforward validation associated with a
blockchain environment is a secure process that ensures data
integrity. furthermore, a cryptography public key will be added
to the SCIChain and application to promote a higher standard
of security. the symmetric-encrypted key used by SCIChain
is 2048-bit, which is a supremely secure method of data
transformation in today’s technology-based world.
PAge 19




3.5 Stem Cell Innovations’ Data Structure
Hyperledger fabric allows SCI to use multiple languages to communicate with current electronic medical
Records and Health electronic Records (emR/HeR) systems. HIPAA regulations need to be considered
at all access points where medical data is concerned. SCI uses the highly-encrypted 2048-bit unique
identifier to manage those regulations and considerations. the unique identifier string code will have
static attributes. the access control language will define the settings for the data to be transmitted, and
will grant or restrict transmission on the network.
the SCI system uses double-encryption methodology on a private blockchain designed by SCI. the data
are private and not accessible to anyone outside the blockchain or the network curated by SCI.
Information travels to and from blockchain technology based on permissions provided by users for
providers to view records, which are activated by triggers via the unique identifier. this index will be
stored on each node on the blockchain and will carry an address to the next node in the blockchain,
building an unbreakable indexed blockchain. In addition, there will be an auditing trail that will monitor
changes on the blockchain and will enable the viewing of the history of stem cell records from creation
to a set point in time. Record trails allow SCI to find errors, debug issues, improve the customized
blockchain, and report on network functional views to upgrade SCI’s blockchain as needed.
SCI will implement the smart contract on the eRC20 platform, which enables secure distribution
of currency via public key cryptography. these transactions carry unique, cryptographically-signed
agreements to complete the values of the transactions. the smart contract attribute will follow particular

3.6 Decentralization
the ultimate goal of the SCIApplication is to give users control
over their own stem cell data while storing and processing that
data in a decentralized way to ensure data integrity and security.
In this case, decentralization means removing barriers to access
for patients in need of stem cell treatment and putting the
tHe uLtImAte goAL of
control of information and access in the hands of those that
need it most. Decentralization enables an SCI user to access         tHe SCIAPPLICAtIon IS
our network of stem cell services and therapies without having
to wait for time-consuming referrals, wait-lists for treatments,     to gIve uSeRS ContRoL
and access to their own information. the private nature of the
data SCI will handle through its application requires maximum        oveR tHeIR oWn Stem
security and care; therefore, SCI has developed a process of

approving new nodes on the blockchain network that will ensure
the security and integrity of user data remains safe.
And ProcEssinG thAt
At a minimum, creating new nodes on the SCI blockchain will

WAy to enSuRe DAtA
•   Applying transparent encryption to protect sensitive data
at the string or bit level in noSQL databases (Cassandra,

mongoDb, and Hbase, etc.) and SQL databases (microsoft
SQL Server, oracle, Ibm Db2, mySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.);
•   Defining smart contracts using SCIChain to control who and
what can access the data, including database administrators
and other privileged users;
•   using SCI unique identification as a key and policy for
management and operations, auditing capability on database
transactions.
In the health care system, decentralization disrupts the industry
that has relied on person-to-person transactions and sharing of
information from a centralized place, leaving patients without
access to their own information and in many cases, powerless to
take ownership of their health and wellness. SCI is changing the
way people seek health care and gain access to the services they
need around the world.

STEM CELL INNOVATIONS APPLICATION
the Stem Cell Innovations Application can help people manage their
own health and wellness, promote healthy living, and gain access
to the world of stem cell innovations. Such tools are being adopted
almost as quickly as they can be developed. According to the uS
food and Drug Administration, “by 2018, 50 percent of the more
than 3.4 billion smartphone and tablet users will have downloaded
mobile health applications.”3

Emergency Patient Information
In this section of the application, users will sign an electronic waiver form allowing stem cell specialists
and medical groups full access to their private information via smart contracts within blockchain
technology. A predetermined information set will be collected and stored in the application for use during
an emergency situation. users will be able to set guidelines for the use of and access to their personal
information.
PAGE 23




Non-Emergency Patient Information
each user will provide personal information including contact
information, an email and password, medical insurance carrier,
and employer information. using a customer support application
interface, users will be able to provide access to support teams
and medical professionals to gain access to their services. In
addition, feedback will be collected from users to determine the
overall experience of application users and the information will
be beneficial to improving user experience.
Patient Tools
Age Determination
Determining patients exact age is possible using an “age by
Dob” function that will provide practitioners with age in years,
months, and days.
b.m.I Calculator
by using an algorithm to calculate body mass index (bmI)
for both males and females, practitioners will have access to
information that could determine the condition of a patient’s
body. the algorithm for this patient tool is based on the user’s
height, weight, age, and gender. bmI provides information
related to weight class to aid decision making and treatments.
this section of the tool will also provide a notes section and
reference guide.
B.M.I Calculator Boys: this is a very specialized calculator for boys
(2-20 years). the application is based on sex, age, weight, and
height and will provide b.m.I score and z-score. Practitioners
can use this information to determine if a boy is underweight,
at a healthy weight, overweight or considered obese. there will
also be formulas and references based on pertinent information
related to boys aged 2-20 years old.
•   Height Percentile Boys: Also designed for boys aged 2-20
years old, this calculator formula will be based on the
algorithms used by the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) providing information related to age
in years and height “in centimeters/ inches”. After the
calculation, the application will give results displaying a
z-score and a height percentile. It will determine if the boy is
of short stature, normal stature, or tall stature. this is crucial
in determining the boy’s health for practitioners to make
decisions about treatment options.
PAGE 24




B.M.I Calculator Girls: this is a separate, very specialized
calculator for girls (2-20 years). the application is based on sex,
age, weight, and height of a young girl. b.m.I score and z-score
are provided based on the information collected. this application
will identify if the girl is underweight, healthy weight, overweight
or obese. there will also be formulas and references customized
especially for girls
•   Height Percentile Girls: Also based on the algorithms used
by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
this calculator is for girls ages 2-20 years. this application
is based on a girl’s age in years and height “in centimeters/
inches”. After the calculation, the application will give results
displaying a z-score and a height percentile for the girl. It will
determine if the girl is of short stature, normal stature, or
tall stature. this is crucial in determining the girl’s health for
treatment options available to a practitioner.
Pill Identifier
ensuring accurate information related to patient medication is
vital to understand treatment, stopping and starting treatment,
and more. this tool allows patients to identify medications they
have to take based on qualities about the pills. Information
such as shape, color, form, and scoring will provide pictures of
possible medications matching pills in our database.
Pregnancy
Estimated delivery date: this is a very important calculator for
expecting mothers. this application estimates the delivery
date of birth based on patient information collected in the
application. It uses the current date and the first day of last
period to determine a patient’s date of delivery based on the
timing of patients last menstrual period. the application will
provide a gestation age estimating how long the baby has been
developing since conception, measured in weeks.
Pregnancy calculator: Pregnancy calculator estimated Date of
delivery (eDD). this is a more advanced delivery date calculator.
the application estimates the date of delivery based on multiple
parameters. the patient can choose the parameter they are
more comfortable with or the parameter available to them at
the time of calculation. the calculation allows the patient to
choose between the current gestational age of the baby, or by
adding 40 weeks to the first day of the last menstrual period or
gestational age by ultrasound date (uS). users can then compare
that information to the current date to give an estimated date of
delivery.
PAGE 25




Prenatal Iron Replacement: this application is for prenatal iron
replacement (prenatal dosing). the application will calculate the
iron deficiency in pregnant women based on weight “kilograms/
pound”, age, height and hemoglobin blood test. the calculator
will prescribe the needed dosage of iron. there will be a formula,
notes, and references for additional information and record
keeping.
Infant weight percentile: this application, based on the Center
for Disease Control and Prevention “CDC”, uses algorithms for
infant weight percentile in reference to infant age (under 36
months). It uses infant sex, age “in months”, weight “in kilograms/
pounds”. the application will provide the result of a z-score and
a weight-to-age percentile to determine infant health based on
weight. this is a specialized formula used only for infants under
36 months.
Main Application: Version 2.0
In the second iteration of SCIApplication, more robust features
will be added including more advanced medical record
collection, settings for favorite providers, preferred pharmacies,
insurance and account management preferences.
Medical Records
there is a lack of transparency between all parties involved in
the current medical systems around the world. Patients have
no immediate access to health records written by medical
professionals. medical professionals are only able to share
data quickly within their own organization or with other health
professionals using the same eHR system; in some cases,
transferring data through eHR could be delayed up to 30 days
due to the delay of administrative fees and reliance on human
collection and preparation of documents. this type of record
keeping also means that patients don’t have access to their own
records and can’t review them as needed or wanted.
the following features related to medical records will be added
to version 2.0 of the SCIApplication:
•   A 24/7 live and interactive “decentralized, cloud-based”
document center for patient medical records. using a
comprehensive, secure database, we will be able to gather all
possible patients medical information for storage or recall as
needed.
PAGE 26




•   A ledger of all patients medical visits that includes past and
all future appointments to be made. Information collected
will include what happened during medical appointments
and outcomes found as a result of testing, etc.
Labs tests: Collection of all lab tests requested by different
providers, different medical institutes, and different doctors will
captured in the application or Application Program Interface.
Patients can grant access to different lab test records to
preferred practitioners.
Favorite provider
A list of all medical providers, and institutions available to the
patient in the SCI network will appear here. the user will be able
to pick and choose a favorite provider and or doctor/ medical
institute; preferences will be the first point of contact in case of
emergency or appointment.
Pharmacies
Patients will have an opportunity to list their favorite pharmacies
based on location and personal preferences available in our
network.
Account Management
Patients will be able to control practitioner access to his/
her records using the account management system, acting as
administrator of their own information. A log-in and a user-
friendly interactive front end make it easy for the patient
to grant or deny levels of access to preferred to medical
professionals.
Preferred Payment Method (PPM)
Patients will add preferred payment methods, which will include
insurance card information if applicable. using our token-based
Application Program Interface linked to PPm, patients will
be able to utilize coupons and discounts offered by medical
providers, medical institutes and pharmaceuticals where patients
can enjoy the benefits of being part of our blockchain.
Link to Insurance Provider
Patients can connect their insurance provider to our application
interface. Patients will have administrator rights to configure and
control the use of insurance. updates to insurance information
can be made at any time in this section of the SCIApplication.
PAGE 27




Main Application: Version 3.0
With the third iteration of SCIApplication, users will be able
to book appointments with a stem cell specialist in our vast
network of professionals, gain access to specialists on demand,
and use video-consulting technology to engage with medical
professionals as needed.
Stem Cell Specialist (SCS) Appointments
An Application Program Interface linked interactively with
“medical records, account management, and link to insurance
providers” will be established. users will also be able to set up
appointment reminders with an in-app calendar and a road-map
linked to an Application Program Interface estimating time and
traffic.
Stem Cell Specialist onDemand (SCSoD)
A video consultation software will be added that allows
communication between patient and stem cell specialist.
Providers in our network will have the same video consultation
software via an Application Program Interface linking provider to
patient in the main application’s Professional section.
key features of this on-demand service include:
•   Round-the-clock Access: SCSoD will be linked to patient
information such as personal information, medical records,
insurance provider, and preferred payment options. Patients
maintain control of what information is released to providers
in this section as well.
•   Schedule a live, video appointment or in-person appointment
with a provider directly through the application.
•   video Consultation Assets
•   SCIApplication platform will use three new technologies
for the SCSoD
•   user matching engine (ume)
•   Cross diagnosis engine (CDe)
•   Smart Routing (SR)
PAGE 28




Non-Emergency Medical Transport
this feature will link non-emergency medical transport to
patients who need transportation between services. With the
ability to choose from a variety of services including door-
to-door ambulatory care, wheelchair or gurney/stretcher
transportation, users can use preferred payment methods,
insurance, or SCI tokens as payment for such services.
4.2 Professional’s Application Program Interface
this section of the SCIApplication is the professional Application
Program Interface for specialists, medical practitioners,
physicians, and stem cell specialists around the world. the
interface allows information to be shared with practitioners
based on access granted by users.
Professional Application: Version 3.5
Several benefits of the SCIApplication Professional Platform
include:
•   Reduction of counterparty risk
•   Increase in efficiency and the ability to see more patients in a
shorter period of time
•   Stem Cell Specialist will advance more accurate diagnosis for
their patients
•   Stem Cell Specialist can communicate with their patient any
time, from anywhere
•   Real-time reporting
•   geographic health monitoring (gHm) of population in real
time
Medical Journal
the Professional Application Program Interface will provide the
latest medical news, studies, and perspectives from stem cell
research around the globe. It will deliver information in a blog
format, which will be updated on daily bases. It will also include
medical headline news from across the globe. In addition,
medical education based on the latest in medical research and
science will be available to professional users.
PAge 29




CDC Alerts
SCIApplication Program Interface will provide live alerts from
the “Centers for Disease Control and Prevention”. It will provide
the latest articles written by the CDC to keep the professionals
in our network up to date with the latest medical emergencies.
It will also have a library of previously published articles and an
extensive medical reference.
Health Directory
the directory will provide practitioners with a list of all contact
information related to hospitals, pharmacies and labs based on
zip code and keywords entered into the database.
Pill Identifier
Similar to the Pill Identifier available in the main Application,
this version will provide doctors with detailed information about
medications and pills. breaking down the pill structure and what
the pill does will allow practitioners to identify any pill they
have based on visual representations. the application requires
information about the pill’s shape, marks, and other details,
and provides pictures of the possible pill. Doctors can choose
the pill that matches a patient’s medication based on looks and
markings.
Electronics Health Care Records
Similar to the access patient’s have to their own medical records,
the Professional Application will provide Stem Cell Specialists
and other health care professional with permission (where
granted by patients) to access a patient’s information based
on need. Patients and Stem Cell Specialists will share medical
records 24/7, 365 days a year. this application will be integrated
with an emR/eHR system, allowing access to labs, test results,
x-rays, videos and more.
Conferencing
this is the medium in which professionals and patients will
interact online. video conferences also allows professional
users to interact with our support team when necessary.
Professionals can also interact with each other in this section of
the application.
Several important functionalities included in the Conferencing
application are:
PAge 30




•   Language: Professionals from different countries and different
nationalities will have a chance to interact with each other
via video, or text. our team will provide translation services.
there will be live video translators and/or the text chats
that will get translated live, or at a later time via emails for
reference and consultation.
•   Collaboration: After overcoming the language barrier, patient
and Stem Cell Specialists will be able to collaborate to fulfill
application transactions. Professionals will also be able
to collaborate via our decentralized blockchain network
instantaneously.
•   Collaboration between Stem Cell Specialist professionals,
lab team, medical insurers and the government will all
be possible via stem cell innovation application with fast,
secure and accurate transmission with “almost no human
errors”.

the ecosystem. Additionally, the participation of physicians
within the ecosystem will allow patients to access medical
care through avenues, such as teleconferencing and video
consultations inside the application. because patients have
control over their own medical data within the ecosystem, they
can seamlessly consult with relevant physicians who can get up
to speed on their case when users provide physicians with direct
access to their medical records through the application.
Exclusivity
With years of experience in the stem cell field, SCI is uniquely
positioned to act as a curator of quality medical and stem cell
services for patients and their physicians. SCI token holders will
have exclusive access to the set of products and services within
the SCI ecosystem, allowing them to purchase what they need
through the SCIApplication. exclusive access to SCI products
and services ensures that token holders benefit directly from
acquiring SCI tokens, which ensures the continued growth and
development of the ecosystem itself.
use of the SCI token will eliminate payment inefficiencies and allow
SCI to provide access to cutting-edge stem cell technology for users
within the ecosystem. All purchases and tools can be completed
using the token within the ecosystem, allowing for a seamless
experience for patients, doctors, and other service providers.
traditional payment methods for medical services and products
are inconvenient and often laborious, while international
payments are particularly fraught with difficulties, such as long
processing times and hefty transaction fees. using one token to
access everything in the SCI ecosystem breaks down barriers for
patients and service providers to gain access to these services,
which increases the frequency of use for patients and service
providers alike. the use of the token allows for quick and secure

IT Development and R&D
Compared to other blockchain technology-based companies,
the SCIApplication and ecosystem has tremendous impact on
the associated It hardware and software costs and burdens.
the application development work will be funded by 25
percent of token pre-sales and 5 percent from token reserves
(potentially a total It budget of $13.2 million). Appropriate time
and resources will be committed to the hardware, software, and
R&D deliverables, which will enhance the product and concepts
within the platform.
SCI considers the security of sensitive data as the utmost
important part of the blockchain technology being used; SCI will
utilize appropriate and powerful servers provisioned in a highly
secured and encrypted environment on our custom blockchain
technology, and in association with the ethereum blockchain.
SCI engineers and software solutions teams will work to ensure
rapid delivery of, and security in, all aspects of the project.
Software design is paramount to ensure ease of use by both
doctors and patients. the application design and development
itself requires a strong team of knowledgeable individuals to
design, reshape, and develop the SCI software applications.
Significant research and development is required because of the
many new and future-forward elements that SCI is developing
to expand the scope of the stem cell field. Internal and external
It professionals will be involved in the innovation of the
customized blockchain technology.
Marketing and Sales
marketing of the SCIApplication will focus on expanding
awareness and speeding the adoption and onboarding
processes, recruitment of doctors for the stem cell specialist
service, and for other products outside the main application.
As part of a targeted marketing campaign, SCI will allocate
a number of tokens to individuals who are familiar with our
company and want to promote our product to social media
audiences around the world. An additional number of tokens will
be reserved for bounty reward programs. bounty tokens will be
divided into group bounties and individual bounties, which will
help promote the SCI project across platforms.
PAGE 36




Legal
the landscape for initial coin offerings, tokens, and all forms of
cryptocurrency are in their infancy, with legislation continuing to
evolve regularly. this coupled with the complex legal aspects of
the medical profession move the SCI team to allocate substantial
resources and funding to legal compliance across all aspects of
the venture.
International Expansion and Partnership of Stem Labs
SCI will increase its reach over time with a structured
international expansion program and by forging partnerships
with other professionals, doctors, and merchants worldwide.
the roadmap also provides an opportunity for SCI to open and
operate stem cell labs and banking networks on a global scale.
Infrastructure and Project Management
Asset management and project management will form a
significant part of the ongoing post-sale project. the nature
of the platform data and the R&D requires secure and robust
management to ensure the continued improvement of the
applications. Additionally, domestic and international recruitment
will be undertaken to staff new global offices as the company
grows.
Lobbying Stem Cell USFDA
As advances in stem cell work are furthered, the allocation
of funds will assist in user adoption by creating a movement
to directly influence decision makers in the united States to
promote and regulate uS stem cell use.
Team and Advisors
the team supports the project and expects its advisors to do
the same. Regarding their commitment to and confidence in the
project, they have instigated a 90 percent vest for 12 months.
Additionally, 10 percent of the allocation will vest for one
month.

5.3 Token Reserve
SCI will consider the usage of reserve tokens over a period of
time both pre- and post-launch. the number of reserve tokens
cannot be fixed due to the nature of the sales and bonus offers.

This whitepaper describes a future project
this whitepaper contains forward-looking statements which
are based on the beliefs of the Company, certain assumptions
made by us and information available to us. the projects
described in this whitepaper are under development and are
constantly being updated, including but not limited to, its
technical features. Accordingly, if and when the SCIChain is
completed, it may differ significantly from the project set out
in this whitepaper. no representation or warranty is given as
to the achievement or reasonableness of any plans, future
projections or prospects and nothing in this document is or
should be relied upon as a promise or representation as to the
future.
SCIA relate to the development and use of experimental
software and technologies that may not come to fruition or
achieve the objectives specified in this whitepaper.
Licences and approvals are not assured in all jurisdictions
the Company intends to operate in full compliance with
applicable laws and regulations and obtain the necessary
licences and approvals in key markets. therefore, the
development and rollout of all the features of the SCIChain
described in this whitepaper are not guaranteed. Regulatory
licences and/or approvals are likely to be required in gibraltar
and, potentially, in a number of relevant jurisdictions in
which relevant activities may take place. It is not possible to
guarantee and we, and no member of its management team
nor its Advisers, makes any assurances that any such licences
or approvals will be obtained within a particular timeframe or at
all. It is, therefore possible that some features of the proposed
SCIChain may not be available in certain markets, or at all. this
could require restructuring of particular aspects of the platform
and/or may result in its unavailability in whole or in part.
