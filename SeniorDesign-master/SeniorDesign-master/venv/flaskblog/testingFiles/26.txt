1 Problem 

1.1 Industry Overview 
  
Tickets  for  entertainment  events  are  typically  available  for  consumers  to  buy  via 
numerous  sales  channels.  The  ticketing  industry  defines  three  high  level  categories  of 
seller: ticket retailers (usually the event organiser with direct responsibility for an event: 
for  example  a  venue,  promoter  or  club,  selling  tickets  directly  to  consumers);  primary 
ticket  agents  (appointed  by  an  event  organiser  to  sell  tickets  to  consumers  on  their 
behalf); and ticket resellers (who source tickets from retailers, agents and other resellers 
to  sell  to  consumers).  A  ticket  sold  for  the  first  time  is  a  primary  ticket  sale.  A  ticket 
resold by an individual, secondary agent, broker or other party is a secondary ticket sale 
(though  the  term  “secondary”  is  misleading,  as  a  ticket  may  theoretically  have  passed 
through  any  number  of  hands  before  it  reaches  the  person  who  actually  attends  the 
event). 

Globally, the ticketing landscape is complex and fragmented. Not only does it depend 
upon  multiple  interactions  within  the  ticketing  ecosystem  (event  organisers,  venues, 
promoters,  bookers,  primary  and  secondary  agents),  but  standard  practice  between 
these  parties  differs  between  geographies.  For  example,  in  the  US,  venues  typically 
control  the  inventory  for  an  event.  In  Europe  the  promoter  typically  controls  the 
inventory. In the UK, exclusivity is rare, with ticketing inventory split between the venue 
and  the  promoter,  who  each  have  their  own  preferred  agent(s).  Practices  also  differ 
dependent upon event type: for example, sporting teams often own the venue. 
  
Within  the  primary  market,  inventory  rights  holders  typically  control  the  ticket  price, 
revenue-splits  and  methods  of  ticket  sale  distribution  (e.g.  to  select  groups  via  third 
parties, with certain promoters or through certain outlets like TicketMaster) [1]. Pricing of 
tickets  within  the  primary  market  takes  place  in  a  variety  of  ways,  including  at  fixed 
value,  in  an  open  auction,  or  using  dynamic  pricing  based  on  demand  on  a  per-seat 
basis[1]. In the primary market, tickets are often sold at below market value, for a variety 
of reasons: for example, so that artists can increase customer loyalty and prioritise fan 
experiences,  or  because  event  organisers  and  promoters  prioritise  revenue  through  in-
event advertising and merchandise sales [2].  
  
The secondary market exists to facilitate the resale of tickets originally purchased on the 
primary market, allowing buyers and sellers to come together in order to transact, often 
via a resale marketplace. While often pilloried by the media and consumer watchdogs, 
the secondary market fulfils a necessary function by enabling greater consumer choice. 
Indeed,  in  his  2016  UK  government-led  review  of  the  secondary  market,  Professor 
Michael Waterson concluded that “consumers and the economy benefit in various ways 
from the existence of a well-functioning secondary ticket market. [1]” 
  
Ticket  pricing  is  far  more  demand-driven  on  secondary  platforms  than  on  primary 
platforms,  with  tickets  finding  their  own  market  value.  Unsurprisingly  though,  pricing 
dynamics within the primary market directly affect the volume and transactional-value 
in  the  secondary  market.  Secondary  platforms  profit  by  taking  a  percentage  of 
secondary sales, typically at around 25-30% [1]: this, allied with the high market value 
for ‘big ticket’ items, means that secondary platforms enjoy higher revenue margins per 
ticket than primary platforms. 
  
To take advantage of the additional revenue available from reselling tickets, there is a 
growing trend for primary agencies to launch their own affiliated secondary markets (for 
example,  Ticketmaster’s  GetMeIn  [3]),  further  complicating  the  already  fragmented 
ticketing  landscape.  Primary  agents  with  their  own  secondary  platform  (or  with  their 
platform  integrated  with  an  existing  resale  platform),  can  deliver  greater  control  and 
transparency  over  ticketing  transactions  –  as  well  as  allowing  them  to  benefit  from  a 
proportion of resale revenues. 

1.2 The Current System is Broken 
  
Event  organisers,  artists  and  managers  often  price  tickets  at  below  market-value  to 
maximise  fan  attendance,  increase  customer  loyalty  and  earn  more  revenue  from  in-
event sales [2]. As a consequence, large economic potential exists for the formation of 
secondary markets, with resellers making large profits by pricing tickets at closer to ‘real‘ 
market-value  [1].  However,  ticketing  rights-holders  in  the  primary  market  have  very 
limited control over inventory sales in secondary markets. This means artists, organisers 
and primary ticketing agents cannot control who can resell their inventory and how they 
can sell it, enforce minimum or maximum price caps, or derive any revenue from these 
secondary sales. 
  
The  unregulated  nature  of  secondary  markets  opens  up  potential  for  industry 
malpractice, unethical touting behaviours and other bad actors [1]. Secondary platforms 
are consequently prone to being pervaded by fraudulent counterfeits, duplicate tickets 
that have been already used or sold, or tickets that have been bulk-purchased by touts 
and re-listed at extortionate prices [4]. 
  
Touts  regularly  circumvent  platform  terms  &  conditions  by  employing  software 
programmes known as “bots” to automate bulk purchase of tickets, which are then listed 
across  multiple  secondary  sites  (often  at  inflated  prices,  averaging  49%  above  their 
face-value  in  the  primary  market,  but  with  some  margins  exceeding  1000%)  [8]. 
According to TicketMaster, such purchases contribute to around 60% of sales to popular 
shows  [6]. 
  Listing  on  multiple  secondary  sites  can  lead  to  the  same  ticket  being 
purchased multiple times on different secondary sites (as duplicate or counterfeit tickets) 
[8]. The Telegraph has estimated that Britons squandered over £5 million on counterfeit 
tickets in 2015 [9]. 

In  some  cases,  touts  engage  in  “speculative  buying”:  a  practice  which  consists  of 
automatically reserving tickets in bulk on primary sites. As the secondary seller does not 
yet  technically  ‘own’  the  ticket,  the  ticket  may  be  released  back  into  the  primary 
inventory pool before the secondary purchaser has completed their purchase – leading 
to inability for secondary sellers to fulfil sales. 
  
Bulk purchase of tickets by bots has the result that popular events can appear to sell-out 
on primary sites in minutes [6]. Primary market platforms earn initial revenue from each 
primary  ticket  sale,  so  these  platforms  maximise  their  revenue  by  maximising  the 
number  of  tickets  sold.  This  means  these  platforms  are  positively  incentivised  to  not 
prevent  the  use  of  bots  to  bulk-purchase  tickets.  There  are  also  extra  benefits  for 
promoters, who may use primary sales to gauge overall consumer demand for events in 
order to make decisions about extending tours or adding extra event dates. 
  
While  the  practice  of  speculative  buying  and  bulk  purchase  consumes  the  economic 
potential  created  by  the  pricing  inefficiencies  within  the  primary  market,  it  is  felt  by 
many  to  be  fundamentally  unfair  on  fans  and  audiences.  This  phenomenon  prevents 

price-sensitive fans from attending an event and causes regular fans to pay higher-than-
intended prices for tickets, resulting in customer dissatisfaction and poor brand publicity 
for the artist, club or venue [7]. 
  
The  complex  and  fragmented  nature  of  the  ticketing  landscape  means  that  lines 
between markets are blurred, resulting in consumer confusion. Research has shown that 
consumers fail to differentiate between primary and secondary markets; 1 in 4 customers 
admit  they  do  not  know  where  they  are  buying  their  tickets  from,  be  it  primary, 
secondary or even fraudulent outlets [1].  The often time-sensitive nature of many ticket 
sales  often  compounds  this  issue,  meaning  consumers  fail  to  interrogate  purchasing 
decisions fully due to a pressure to act quickly in order to secure a ticket. 

1.3 Existing Solutions 
  
Attempts  to  address  these  key  challenges  (improving  consumer  experience  through 
tackling  unethical  behaviours,  and  improving  rights-holder  and  primary  seller  controls 
over  secondary  markets),  are  generally  being  made  via  three  different  routes: 
technology,  legislation  and  self-regulation.  The  overarching  goal  is  to  develop  ways 
which  determine  the  legitimacy  of  tickets  listed  on  secondary  sites,  in  order  to  deliver 
fairer practices and greater consumer confidence upon purchase.  

1.3.1 Technology 
Some primary markets such as Resident Advisor [11] or fan-to-fan transfer marketplaces 
like  Twickets  [12]  target  extortionate  pricing  and  unethical  touting  behaviour  through 
mechanisms  which  only  allow  the  resale  or  other  transfer  of  a  ticket  at  its  primary 
market face-value or lower. Other platforms, such as Songkick [13] and Dice.fm[14], have 
developed  data-driven  techniques  to  distinguish  touts  at  the  point-of-purchase  and 
identify  tickets  on  secondary  market  websites.  Dice.fm  prevents  resale  of  its  tickets 
altogether.   
  
Unfortunately,  these  technological  methods  fall  short  of  solving  the  challenges 
previously outlined: 
  

1

● Outright prevention of ticket resale removes consumer choice, preventing genuine 
fans who for legitimate reasons cannot attend the given event from reselling their 
tickets; 
● Mandating  that  resales  are  only  permitted  to  take  place  at  face-value  or  less 
creates  incentives  for  black-market  activities  (for  example,  additional  offline 
monetary transactions taking place on top of legitimate online transactions); 

● Identification  of  touts  using  machine-learning  techniques  is  a  losing  battle,  as 
scalpers  have  a  vested  interested  in  keeping  ahead  of  current  algorithmic 
techniques and changing their behaviour accordingly. 

 Songkick’s ticketing commerce platform and anti-scalping algorithm were acquired by Live 
1
Nation in January 2018 [15]

More  effective  than  the  above  technologies  are  solutions  which  focus  on  platform 
integration  and  creating  visibility  across  inventory.  For  example,  Eventim’s  secondary 
market,  FanSale,  offers  a  Ticketcheck  functionality  [16]  which  allows  consumers  to 
confirm  the  legitimacy  of  a  ticket  being  resold  via  its  Eventim  barcode.  For  obvious 
reasons, primary platforms who run their own secondary markets have the most success 
with this technique; however, drawbacks remain due to the siloed nature of the ticketing 
industry, with no standardised method of checking a ticket’s legitimacy. 

1.3.2 Legislation 
  
Authorities  have  recognised  unfair  practices  within  the  secondary  market,  with  some 
countries  –  including  France  and  Italy  –  outlawing  touting  altogether  [17].  Consumer 
watchdogs  the  world  over  are  warning  against  unethical  behaviours  facilitated 
secondary  platforms,  with  The  UK’s  Advertising  Standards  Agency  (ASA)  [18],  Australia’s 
Competition and Consumer Commission [19], New Zealand’s Consumer NZ [20] and Ireland’s 
Advertising Standards Authority [21] conducting investigations in the last year alone. 
  
In the UK the reselling of tickets to football matches [22] without the permission of the 
relevant  club  is  illegal,  and  use  of  automated  technologies  to  bulk-buy  tickets  was 
outlawed by the UK government in January 2018. As of April 2018, secondary platforms 
must also include the unique ticket number (UTN) allocated to a ticket by the primary 
agent in any resale listings [23]. 
  
Fundamentally, however, it is very difficult to control or constrain black-markets: despite 
football  clubs  maintaining  authorised-reseller  lists,  tickets  still  regularly  appear  on 
unofficial  platforms.  At  sports  matches  and  concerts  globally,  black-market  sales 
continue to occur (often immediately outside of the venue itself [18]). 
  
Within  the  US,  legislative  controls  are  determined  on  a  state-by-state  basis.  This  has 
limited  impact,  though,  as  many  resellers  exploit  loopholes  by  selling  tickets  in  the 
nearest state where the practice is legal. For example, the majority of brokers operating 
in  New  York  –  where  use  of  ticketing  bots  has  carried  a  hefty  fine  since  2016  –  have 
registered  offices  in  New  Jersey  and  Connecticut.  Industry  supporters  of  such  laws 
acknowledge  their  constraints,  with  Jeffrey  Seller  (lead  producer  of  Hamilton  on 
Broadway) stating, “Is it imperfect? Of course. Is it better than nothing? You bet.” [24] 

In  the  UK,  the  West  End  production  of  Hamilton  has  taken  a  different  approach  by 
introducing an entirely paperless ticketing system. [25] 

1.3.3 Self-regulation 
  
With  growing  pressure  from  fans,  consumer  watchdogs  and  artists  themselves,  many 
secondary platforms are investing in self-regulatory endeavours in order to rehabilitate 
negative views of the secondary market and help restore consumer confidence.  
  

Many  secondary  platforms  have  put  guarantees  in  place  to  protect  consumers  by 
offering replacements for tickets that do not arrive or refunds on fraudulent tickets [1]. 
However,  while  providing  a  refunding  on  ticket  that  is  void  on  the  door  offers  some 
degree of recompense, it does not protect attendees from extra costs incurred (such as 
travel, accommodation, time, and disappointment). 
  
Large  artists  (such  as  Ed  Sheeran,  Adele  and  Taylor  Swift  [26])  are  actively  working  to 
raise anti-touting awareness and circumvent damaging behaviours, trialling a range of 
methods to prevent touting. While this approach can be immediately effective for large 
artists with a lot of clout who have the will and resources to go the extra mile on behalf 
of  their  fans,  fraudulent  ticketing  and  unethical  touting  practices  continue  to  harm 
smaller artists and their fans. 
  
However, big-name awareness does serve to increase pressure upon secondary resellers; 
for  example,  StubHub  stated  in  March  2018  that  they  would  support  “any  measures 
which make ticket buying easier, more convenient and more transparent for fans” [27]. 
  
As a result, secondary platforms increasingly choose to commit to codes of ethics and 
conduct  [1];  for  example,  by  becoming  members  of  The  Society  of  Ticket  Agents  and 
Retailers (STAR), whose Code of Practice aims to set high standards for customer service 
in  the  industry  and  provide  an  approved  dispute  resolution  service.  Other  industry 
consortiums have been founded with the express aim of promoting a culture of ethical 
practice, including FanFair Alliance (made up of members of entertainment community 
to lobby on behalf of consumers), and the newly-created Fair Ticketing Alliance (made 
up of secondary ticketing brokers with the goal of rehabilitating the ticketing industry) 
[28]. 
  
Criticisms  are  also  levied  against  secondary  platforms  regarding  their  higher  revenue 
margins, which often mean they have the financial capability to invest more deeply in 
online  advertising  spend  (via  SEO,  SEM  and  targeted  social  media  marketing)  than 
primary  markets.  In  turn,  this  increased  discoverability  gives  secondary  agents  greater 
access to potential consumers, allowing them to out-compete primary markets in both 
margins  and  visibility.  This  can  contribute  to  the  consumer’s  lack  of  ability  to 
differentiate between primary, secondary and illegitimate sellers. 
  
According  to  The  FanFair  Alliance,  consumers  have  “three  recurring  complaints:  they 
were  directed  via  Google  advertising  towards  these  sites,  they  thought  they  were 
purchasing  from  an  authorised  seller,  and  they  were  misled  on  pricing”  [29]  Some 
advertising channels and now taking steps to redress the balance, with Google cracking 
down  on  language  used  within  AdWords  to  increase  transparency  for  consumers. 
Secondary sites who imply they are a primary marketplace will be denied ‘certification’, 
and therefore not permitted to leverage paid ads within the channel [30]. 

1.4 Conclusion 
  
Since  the  challenges  in  the  ticketing  industry  have  not  yet  been  comprehensively 
addressed  by  technology,  legislation,  or  self-regulation,  stakeholders  have 
understandably become pessimistic as to whether the ticketing market will ever change 
for the better [31]. 

● Event  organisers  and  rights-holders  need  greater  controls  and  internal 
transparencies over the lifecycle of their ticketing inventory - including over how 
and who can interact with their inventory as secondary sellers; 

● Consumers  are  increasingly  demanding  a  fairer  and  more  positive  experience, 
with more transparency over who and how they are purchasing tickets, and less 
chance of refused entry on the door due to fraudulent or duplicate tickets; 

● Artists, managers and promoters need more say in how their inventory is priced 
and how that pricing is perpetuated throughout the ticketing lifecycle, right up to 
when it is presented by the ticket-holder for access to the event; 

● Secondary  ticketing  platforms  need  to  be  better  incentivised  to  act  as  ‘good 
actors’ within the ticketing ecosystem, providing better consumer experience and 
driving repeat custom. 

  
We believe that the problems highlighted in this paper point to a need to re-build the 
industry from the bottom-up, replacing the current, siloed, architecture to create a new, 
fair,  secure  and  transparent  economic  model  under  which  event  organisers  and 
inventory rights-holders would have greater control.  

2 The Aventus Solution 

2.1 Overview 
  
The  Aventus  solution  aims  to  remove  siloes  and  create  an  open  ticketing  ecosystem 
where all parties in the ticketing supply chain can work together with more control, more 
internal operational transparency, and more security. It is designed as a modular toolset 
which will enable ticketing organisations to exert more control over their inventory and 
processes,  engage  more  directly  with  other  players  within  the  supply  chain  and  with 
consumers, and explore new methods of monetisation.  
  
This solution will be underpinned by the Aventus Protocol, a global open standard for the 
exchange of tickets built upon the Ethereum blockchain, and the subject of this paper.  
The  Protocol  is  designed  to  support  and  facilitate  events  organisers  and  inventory 
holders, giving them the tools to set controls around how their tickets are transacted and 
resold.  Through  use  of  Ethereum  smart  contracts,  the  Protocol  enables  a  secure  and 
controlled  supply-chain  that  can  eliminate  counterfeiting  and  prioritises  rights-holder 
needs. The Aventus Protocol is open source and available for all developers to leverage 
of build upon.  
  
As tickets held on the blockchain each have a unique identifier, the Protocol facilitates 
greater security, control, internal traceability and proof-of-ownership, making it possible 
to track a particular tickets UTN as it travels through the supply-chain. It allows event 
organisers  to  create,  manage  and  promote  their  events  and  tickets  with  dramatically 
reduced  costs,  even  letting  them  set  price  controls  and  receive  commissions  on  ticket 
resales. Consumers within the ecosystem are rewarded for identifying fraudulent activity, 
creating a self-governing community.  
  
It is important to note that Aventus itself remains objective and agnostic when it comes 
to  the  setting  of  parameters  for  ticket  sale  and  resale,  which  are  selected  and  set  by 
inventory  holders  to  best  fit  their  business  models.  Aventus  does  not  own,  sell  or 
distribute inventory, or dictate rules to players within the ecosystem. 
  
To help bring blockchain ticketing to the consumer, the Aventus Protocol Foundation will 
also work with, support and endorse the creation of B2B SaaS tool-sets, applications and 
APIs created by third-party service providers, ticketing agencies and developers. These 
services will provide a critical function in bridging the gap between the Protocol and the 
existing tech stacks of traditional ticketing industry entities.  

2.2 The Aventus Ecosystem 
Despite the fact that the primary innovation discussed in this paper is the Protocol itself, 
it is worth explaining wider Aventus ecosystem (as depicted in Figure 1) and how industry 
players act within it (see 2.2.2). 

Figure 1: The Aventus Ecosystem 

2.2.1 The Ethereum Blockchain 
  
Bitcoin is the most widely-known use-case for the blockchain: a network designed for 
decentralised,  peer-to-peer  monetary  transactions,  with  no  need  for  a  centralised 
bank or intermediary. 
  
Money has a distinct difference from assets such as media, documents, and message 
content:  ownership.  Money  can  only  be  owned  by  one  party  at  once  (it  cannot  be 
double-spent),  and  we  need  to  track  how  it  is  moved  between  parties  in  order  to 
“prove”  ownership.  As  a  distributed,  immutable  (tamper-proof)  ledger,  blockchain 
provides a solution to this: a single source of truth which allows all parties to see the 
provenance and transaction history of each token of currency. 

The  Ethereum  blockchain  extends  this  functionality  through  digitally-enforceable 
agreements – known as “smart contracts”. 
  
These  smart  contracts  can  be  applied  to  core  business  processes  where  security, 
control,  traceability  and  proof-of-ownership  are  necessities:  in  this  case,  within  the 
ticketing supply chain. That’s where the Aventus Protocol comes in. 

2.2.2. The Aventus Protocol 
  
The  subject  of  this  paper.  The  Aventus  Protocol  is  open  source,  and  provides  a 
backbone  of  interoperability  which  will  lower  barriers  to  entry  for  developers  in  the 
ticketing industry. 
  
This layer is entirely composed of Ethereum smart contracts that allow for the creation 
and  validation  of  events,  the  issuance,  sale  and  distribution  of  tickets  in  primary  and 
secondary  ticket  markets  (under  parameters  designed  and  customised  by  inventory 
holders and event organisers), and the allocation of defined proportions of ticket sale 
revenue and market/event fees between the event organisers, ticket promoters, artists, 
secondary resellers, etc. 

2.2.3. The Service Layer 
  
Services  built  on  top  of  the  Aventus  Protocol  are  designed  to  make  using  the 
Protocol as efficient and accessible as possible, and will offer a potential source of 
revenue  for  developers  looking  to  build  mainstream,  blockchain-ready  ticketing 
applications.  These  services  are  expected  to  include  scalability  solutions, 
integration  with  synergistic  entertainment  token  environments,  optimisation  of 
purchasing  time  through  use  of  market-feed  oracles,  and  interoperability 
infrastructure such as SDKs and APIs.   
  
As the Protocol itself is (and will remain) open source, this low barrier to entry will 
guarantee  a  competitive  services  layer  environment  that  will  drive  cost-efficiency 
for  ticketing  agencies  wishing  to  take  advantage  of  the  business  benefits  of  the 
Protocol.   Agencies wishing to develop apps and services built upon the Protocol 
can partner with third-party developers, existing third-party service providers in the 
ecosystem,  or  utilise  their  own  in-house  technical  resources  to  build  direct-to-
Protocol apps.  

2.2.4 The Application Layer 
  
The  Application  Layer  consists  of  end-user  applications  that  build  on  top  of  the 
Services  and  Protocol  layers,  making  blockchain-based  ticketing  apps  available 
within a commercial environment for the entertainment industry and its consumers. 
This  will  incorporate  inventory  management  solutions,  blockchain  ticket  wallets 
and access control solutions, along with apps enabling the creation of promotional 
schemes for encouraging more ticket sales. Aventus encourages and supports the 
work of third party developers to create applications on top of the Service Layer. 

2.3 Use Cases 
Actors within the ecosystem: 

  

● Ticketing retailers (primary agents, secondary agents) 
● Event organisers (venues, promoters, clubs, artists) 
● Consumers (ticket buyers) 
● Ticketing software providers 
● AVT holders 
● Aventus technical team 
● Third-party developers 

  
The  Aventus  Protocol  is  designed  to  resolve  the  industry  challenges  highlighted 
earlier in this paper, making ticketing processes more efficient and effective for all 
parties in the supply chain. 

1.  Increased Control Over Inventory 

The Aventus Protocol gives event organisers, inventory-holders and artists the 
tools  to  set  and  enforce  rules  around  how  their  tickets  are  transacted  and 
interacted with within the ticketing supply chain. 
  
This  includes  setting  of  minimum  and  maximum  price  caps,  whitelisting  of 
approved  resellers,  and  even  defining  processes  which  entitle  artists, 
organisers  and  primary  sellers  to  a  proportion  of  secondary  market  resale 
revenues. 
  

● Tickets  have  a  unique  identity  associated  with  them  on  the  blockchain; 
usually  a  barcode  or  a  QR  code.  The  validation  mechanism  chosen  is 
determined by the event organiser, and added at the point of purchase in 
the  primary  market.  No  personal  data  is  ever  held  in  clear  text  on  the 
blockchain;  while  identities  linked  to  tickets  are  securely  verifiable,  any 
personal  data  is  obfuscated  and  encoded  in  a  cryptographically-secure 
manner, ensuring no sensitive information is ever publicly visible and that 
the  Protocol  is  fully  compliant  with  General  Data  Protection  Regulation 
(GDPR). 

● The identity associated with the relevant ticket will be checked upon entry 
by  Access  Control  and  compared  to  the  obfuscated  data  held  on  the 
blockchain. Changes to identities associated with a ticket (thus changes to 
the “owner” of the ticket) can only take place if the ticket is resold through 
an  approved  secondary  market  and  meets  with  the  rules  and  controls 
enforced by the event organiser or inventory-holder. 

For artists actively trying to eliminate or restrict touting (for example Beyonce 
and Jay-Z, Ed Sheeran, Stormzy), these controls give the promoter the ability 
to  outlaw  resale  of  tickets  altogether,  or  to  set  price  caps  that  prevent 
extortionate  charges  for  fans.  Actors  wishing  to  explore  new  monetisation 
opportunities  can  set  up  microtransactions  that  allow  various  entities  in  the 

  

  
  

supply-chain  (promoters,  venues,  artists,  managers)  to  be  allocated  a 
proportion of resale revenues from the secondary market. 

  

2.  Increased Security & Decreased Fraudulent Behaviour 

The  Aventus  Protocol  offers  consumers  a  fairer  and  more  positive  experience 
by  enabling  inventory  holders  to  prohibit  unauthorised  resale  on  the 
blockchain,  thereby  eliminating  counterfeit  or  duplicate  tickets  and  vastly 
decreasing the possibility of fraudulent behaviour. 

  

  

Should  an  event  itself  be  fictitious  or  fraudulent,  the  economic  model 
underpinning the Aventus Protocol incentivises network participants to report it 
as  such,  creating  a  self-governing  ecosystem.  The  community  of  users  of  the 
Aventus Protocol (or the ‘Aventus Community’) determines the legitimacy of an 
event or a third-party seller using a decentralised consensus mechanism on the 
blockchain.  

   Given  the  transparent  nature  of  the  blockchain,  many  of  the  oversight  issues 
discussed  in  Section  1.2.  can  be  resolved.  Consumers  will  be  able  to  find  a 
validated list of outlets selling tickets on the blockchain, making it simpler for 
them  to  differentiate  between  types  of  platform.  Meanwhile,  duplicate  and 
counterfeit tickets will be impossible within the Aventus ecosystem due to each 
ticket’s unique identifier, and fraudulent behaviours will be vetted and rejected 
by the Aventus community.  

3.  Increased Internal Transparency and Consumer Insight 

The  Aventus  Protocol  gives  ticketing  agents  the  tools  to  derive  more  internal 
insight  into  the  supply  chain,  allowing  them  to  understand  and  target  existing 
consumers  more  effectively  and  to  discover  new  audiences.  By  analyzing  and 
reporting on data held on the Protocol and combining this data with internally-
held  consumer  data-sets,  agents  can  tell  who  bought  tickets,  how  many  times 
each ticket was transacted, whether a ticket was redeemed on the door and the 
identity of the redeemer. Going further, it becomes possible to analyze, audit and 
support  counter-claims  against  charge-backs  –  avoiding  unnecessary  revenue 
losses – and even to implement tighter access controls and blacklist undesirable 
attendees.  

4.  New Revenue Opportunities 

The  Aventus  Protocol  will  support  artists  and  event  organisers  by  enabling 
events to reach a wider and more targeted audience:  

● Event  organisers  can  whitelist  or  blacklist  chosen  promoters  and  sales 
channels,  giving  them  full  curated  control  over  the  audience  their 
inventory  reaches.  Inventory  can  also  be  opened  up  to  everyone, 
creating  a  global  pool  of  events  which  can  be  sold  through  any 
ticketing  application,  incentivised  via  commission  –  overturning  the 
current  siloed  nature  of  the  industry  and  encouraging  mutual 
participation to drive increased sales. 

  

  

  

● Event  organisers  will  be  able  to  reward  promoters  or  ticketing  software 
providers  with  a  commission  on  ticket  sales  they  are  responsible  for 
generating.  These  commissions  can  be  controlled  by  the  event  organiser 
to  be  as  dynamic  or  complex  as  desired,  since  each  individual  promoter 
can receive a different set commission. 

2.4 AVT Utility Tokenomics 
  
The  Aventus  Protocol  Token  (AVT)  is  critical  to  the  functioning  of  the  Aventus 
ecosystem  as  a  decentralised,  self-regulating  environment.  By  aligning  the 
economic  incentives  of  participants,  it  addresses  the  challenges  highlighted  in 
Section 1 of this paper. 

2.4.1 Purpose 
  
The main purposes of AVT as a utility token are: 
  
1. To  provide  an  incentive  layer  that  enables  self-regulation  of  the  Aventus 
Protocol.  By  creating  and  curating  a  network  of  due-diligence  reporters  on 
events  and  applications  held  on  the  Protocol,  the  ecosystem  is  secured  and 
fraud is minimised. 

  

This  is  implemented  through  stake-weighted  voting  mechanisms  (further 
explained in section 3.1) which allow the Aventus Community to determine: 

a. Legitimacy of apps/DApps using the Aventus Protocol (section 3.1.1) so 

that unethical behaviours and bad actors are disenfranchised. 

b. Legitimacy  of  events  on  the  Aventus  Protocol  (section  3.1.2)  so  that 
apps/Ðapps  do  not  lose  users  by  selling  tickets  for  fraudulent  events, 
and consumers do not experience disappointment. 

c. Governance of the future parameters of the Aventus Protocol, so that 
the  Protocol  can  constantly  evolve  to  remain  competitive  and  best 
serve the ticketing community. 

2. To  reward  early  adopters  of  the  Aventus  Protocol,  thereby  enabling  it  to  benefit 
from  network  effects.  Network  effects  apply  to  the  Aventus  Protocol:  as  the 
number  of  events  stored  on  it  grows,  the  greater  value  it  has  to  third-party 
applications;  and  the  greater  the  value  it  represents  to  third-party  applications, 
the more the number of events stored on it will grow. . 

2.3.2 Mechanics 
  
There are three primary use cases envisaged for AVT: 
  

Event hosting: Event organisers must purchase AVT to pay the event-creation 
fee. This cost will be proportional to the number of events deemed fraudulent 
in  the  Protocol.  To  ensure  that  the  cost  remains  stable,  the  volatility  of  AVT 
will be tempered by accounting for the fiat currency exchange rate. 
  
Community stake: Events can be reported as being suspected of being fictitious 
or fraudulent through a voting mechanism which involves putting up a deposit of 
AVT, which is detailed in section 3.1. below. This economically incentivises third-
parties using the Aventus Protocol not to sell fictitious or fraudulent tickets. Third-
party  ticket-sellers  on  the  Protocol  go  through  a  similar  process  of  being 
validated  by  the  network    in  order  to  guarantee  their  legitimacy  and  eliminate 
fraudulent resellers. 

Matching: Tickets sold on the Aventus Protocol in the secondary market will 
be  matched  with  buyers  who  have  previously  registered  a  firm  intent  to 
purchase. Matching is an on-chain calculation that members of the Aventus 
community  can  run  to  pseudo-randomly  match  buyers  and  sellers;  this 
ensures that sellers do not know who they are selling to, preventing touts or 
bad actors demanding additional off-chain monetary transactions on top of 
the on-chain transaction. 
  
It  should  be  noted  that  non-determinism  is  not  possible  on  a  blockchain, 
therefore  (even  when  ’randomly’  choosing  who  receives  which  tickets),  the 
outcome  can  be  known  before  the  matching  transaction  is  entered  into  the 
system. However, as long as the block rewards and transactions fees are not 
less than the matching reward, the system is secure. 

  

  

3 Future Vision 
An Alpha version of the Protocol providing scaled-down functionality was released on 
the  Rinkeby  Public  TestNet  in  July  2017  for  community  review  and  comment.  In 
November  2017,  an  advisory  voting  module  was  made  available  on  the  Ethereum 
MainNet  as  proof-of-concept,  allowing  community  members  to  create  and  vote  on 
proposals.  

Full source-code for the Beta release was initially made available to the public in May 
2018. 
An  in-depth  audit  of  this  source-code  was  carried  out  by  Solidified.io,  the  leading 
technical  auditing  service  for  Ethereum  smart  contracts,  whose  150+  community  of 
Solidity  experts  has  previously  audited  over  40  companies  (including  Polymath, 
Melonport, Bankera and Spring Role). 
  
After undergoing a successful auditing process which exposed zero critical issues, the 
Protocol was deployed in Beta onto the Ethereum MainNet in June 2018. Developers 
can now access the Protocol and accompanying source-code, giving them the tools to 
begin  building  (or  expanding  existing)  ticketing  applications  and  services  to  take 
advantage of the benefits of blockchain. 

Within  beta,  some  elements  of  the  ecosystem  remain  centralised  while  we  iterate  and 
develop the Protocol (for example, see Section 4.1.3). From Version 1.0 onwards, once use 
of the Protocol has been established, control over system parameters will be handed to 
the AVT community, creating a fully decentralised solution.  

The future vision for the full version of the Protocol is detailed in the sections below: 

 3.1 Aventus Registry 

 The Aventus Registry is the entry point to the Aventus Protocol. It keeps track of: 

  

  

  

1.  A list of the legitimate third party applications using the Protocol 

2.  A list of the non-fraudulent events within the Protocol 

3.  Algorithmic parameters determining system deposits and time periods. 

  

Each  of  the  above  variables  will  be  determined  and  consistently  updated  through 
stake-weighted voting by the Aventus Community. The voting process is similar to that 
proposed by Colony [32], whereby: 

  

  

1.   A deposit is put forward to initiate the voting process (the origin of these 

funds is explained below for each particular variable). 

2.    Votes  are  cast  confidentially  by  the  Aventus  Community  in  secret  by 
staking AVT. Once the Vote Reveal Period begins, voters’ stakes are locked. 

3.  Once votes are revealed, voters’ stakes are unlocked. 

4.   When the challenge is ended, the winning party’s deposit is returned and 
the  losing  party’s  deposit  is  distributed  amongst  the  winning  party  (10%), 
the  challenge-ender  (10%)  and  the  winning  voters  (the  remaining  AVT, 
distributed proportionately according to stake).   

The  following  sections  explain  the  application  of  the  voting  process  to  each  of  the 
variables mentioned above: 

3.1.1 Legitimate third party applications using the Protocol 

  

A  third  party  application  that  wishes  to  use  the  Protocol  must  create  a  proposal  in  the 
Aventus registry, requesting to be added to the official list of legitimate applications, if they 
wish to sell tickets for an event. Along with the proposal, a deposit is submitted which will 
power  the  Aventus  Community’s  vote  regarding  the  application’s  legitimacy.  This  is 
necessary  to  give  better  oversight  to  consumers  so  that  they  can  know  where  they  are 
buying their tickets, and can be reassured that the outlets are not fraudulent. 

  

  

3.1.2 Non-fraudulent events within the Protocol 
Events are only added to the official event-listing on the Protocol if the organiser has paid 
the  necessary  event-creation  deposit.  Following  an  event  being  added  to  the  Aventus 
Registry,  the  Aventus  Community  has  a  period  within  which  to  report  it  as  fictitious  or 
fraudulent  by  submitting  a  deposit,  as  previously  described.  The  voting  process  outlined 
above occurs to determine the validity of the event, ensuring the legitimacy of events on the 
platform.  

3.1.3 Algorithmic parameters 

  

All parameters in the system (such as the application-listing deposit, the event-creation 
deposit  or  the  time  period  in  which  an  event  can  be  reported)  affect  the  economic 
behaviour of Protocol participants. Since the parameters are strongly affected by usage 
data of the Protocol itself (e.g. the rate of fraudulent events or the number of fraudulent 
applications  using  it),  they  will  be  re-calibrated  algorithmically  at  the  point  of  event 
creation to ensure platform stability. 

  

Since the algorithms themselves have parameters (such as deposit floors, ceilings, and 
scaling  values),  these  will  also  be  open  to  be  voted  upon  by  the  Aventus  Community. 
Community members can put forward proposals (along with a proposal deposit, in order 

to avoid spam proposals) to alter an algorithmic parameters. After the community votes 
to determine the winning proposal, the deposit is returned  to the community member. 

3.2 Event 
  
Events are listed by paying the event-creation deposit and uploading the event’s details 
(date, location, description, etc). The event creator can then define a series of addresses 
associated with ticketing agencies and resellers for the purposes of selling and refunding 
tickets. 

  

It should be noted that the event-creator will be able, if desired, to define the revenue-
split from ticket sales between the venue, artist, management company etc. 

  
The Protocol supports different event options, such as: 
  
● Private events: the creators must sign off on any ticket sold. 

● Approved  merchant  events:  the  event’s  tickets  can  only  be  sold  or  re-sold 

exclusively via whitelisted sellers. 

  

Before  ticket  sales  for  an  event  can  begin,  a  reporting  period  occurs  during  which  the 
event  can  be  challenged,  as  detailed  in  section  3.1.  The  full  life-cycle  of  an  event  is 
depicted in figure 2. 

 

Figure 2 - The timeline of an event 

3.3 Ticket Sales 

  

When  tickets  are  registered  on  the  blockchain  via  the  Protocol,  a  hash  (or  unique 
identifying series of characters) is generated for that ticket – encoded with the specific 
details of that ticket, e.g. ticket type, seat number, etc - which is then associated with the 
public key of the ticket owner. 

A  ticket  can  then  only  be  transacted  (e.g.  from  event  organiser  to  primary  ticketing 
agent,  from  primary  agent  to  secondary  reseller  or  to  consumer)  with  the  consent  of 
both parties (via their digital signature on the blockchain). The unique identifier of that 
ticket is then re-associated with the public key of its new owner. 
  
A  variety  of  access  control  solutions  can  be  implemented  on  top  of  this  process,  the 
most  simple  of  which  is  simply  using  the  digital  signature  to  prove  the  attendee’s 
ownership of the public key and thus the associated ticket. The Protocol aims to support 
a  wide  variety  of  access  control  needs,  giving  event  organisers  and  venues  the  choice 
and  control  that  is  critical  to  them.  For  example,  if  extra  confidence  and  security  is 
required  upon  the  door,  specific  identity  validation  requirements  (for  example  facial 
recognition, voice analysis, fingerprinting) can be tied to the ticket owner’s public key (as 
long as the data can be obfuscated and encoded on the Protocol). 

3.3.1 Secondary Market 

Figure 3: The Secondary Ticket Market 

The secondary market’s functionality within the Aventus ecosystem is depicted in figure 
3 and works as follows: 
  

● Listing: Listing a ticket requires specifying the ticket ID. A listing remains until 

the inventory is sold or the sale is cancelled by the seller. 

● Buying:  Users  register  an  interest  in  buying  various  combinations  of  tickets 

listed with secondary sellers. 

● Matching:  The  Aventus  community  matches  buyers  with  tickets  in  a  pseudo-

probabilistic manner. 

● Selling: The seller submits the address of the new Ticket Owner to the Protocol, 

which is then recorded against the Ticket ID. 

3.4 Promotion 
  
Since the event listing and ticket selling process has been de-siloed, any validated third-
party application will be able to make sales for any of the event brought to the Protocol 
residing in the event pool. This will mean that listing an event on the Aventus Protocol 
means all parties can start making sales in a completely secure and transparent manner, 
without unregulated touting, counterfeits or oversight issues. 

Furthermore, the event creator can choose (on a per-ticket basis), to create a rewards’ 
scheme giving a commission to promoters and primary ticket sellers. Commissions can 
be as complex, granular and dynamic as desired, based on off-chain determinations of 
the business value of the commissioned party. 
  
This mechanism helps reduce marketing-costs and increases reach into target- markets 
(by decreasing the barriers to entry of becoming a sub-promoter, and allowing for the 
monetisation of word-of-mouth awareness-building). It also minimises the administrative 
overhead  associated  with  managing  compensation,  since  this  can  be  completely 
automated by smart contracts. 
  
There are a couple of possible attack vectors here: 
  
Promoters cannot receive commission on their first sale, mitigating the risk that ticket-
buyers  could  gain  unfair  discount  through  becoming  a  “promoter”  and  purchasing  the 
ticket “through” themselves. 
  
Tickets  sold  in  the  secondary  market  are  not  eligible  for  promoter  commission, 
eliminating the risk that a promoter bulk-purchases tickets “through” themselves to re-
sell  on  the  secondary  market,  generating  unfair  commissions  and  unwarranted  high 
promotional ranking. 

3.5 Market Price Oracle 
  
Blockchains cannot access information not contained within them. Therefore, additional 
data required by the Aventus Protocol must be inserted into the Blockchain. 
  
Problem:  The  party  controlling  the  data  sent  into  the  system  can  affect  the  Protocol’s 
behaviour. 

  
Solutions:  

1. We  will  use  existing  trusted  solutions  (such  as  Oraclise)  and  provide  our  own 
oracle smart-contract. We will allow event-hosts to decide which oracle to use for 
the market price-feed from a list of options approved by the Aventus Community. 
2. AVT  is  listed  on  a  number  of  decentralised  exchanges,  including  AirSwap  and 
SharkRelay.  By  averaging  the  price  across  these  exchanges,  we  will  be  able  to 
derive a reliable price.  

4 Beta Release (June 2018) 

  
As  a  first  iteration  of  the  Protocol,  the  beta  release  provides  the  first  set  of 
functionality  toward  a  more  secure,  more  efficient  way  to  control  the  supply  and 
transaction of tickets. 
  
The sections below will detail how current functionality differs from the future vision of 
the Aventus architecture, with subsections corresponding to those above in Section 3: 

4.1 Aventus Registry 
  
Within the beta version of the Protocol, the Aventus Registry tracks: 
  

● A list of the legitimate third party applications using the Protocol 
● A list of the non-fraudulent events within the Protocol 
● Challenges to the legitimacy of events stored on the Protol, and votes on these 
● Parameters determining system deposits and time periods 
● Proposals for changes to system parameters, and votes on these 

● Deposits and voting stakes of community members 

  
Currently,  only  the  legitimacy  of  events  on  the  Protocol  can  be  challenged  by  the 
Aventus Community.  

4.1.1 Legitimate third party applications using the Protocol 
  
A third party application that wishes to use the Protocol must make an AVT deposit 
from  the  address  they  wish  to  use,  and  then  submit  this  address  to  Aventus  to  be 
added to the approved list of legitimate applications. Upon receipt and verification of 
a request and its accompanying deposit details, Aventus will add the address to the 
approved list, which is held on the Protocol.  

4.1.2 Non-fraudulent events within the Protocol 
  
Current functionality is as described in 3.1.2.  

4.1.3 System parameters 
  
All  parameters  in  the  system  (such  as  the  application-listing  deposit,  the  event-
creation deposit or the time period in which an event can be reported) are currently 
fixed. Community members can put forward proposals to change these parameters. In 
the  beta  version  of  the  Protocol,  these  proposals  are  non-binding  and  are 
implemented at the discretion of Aventus. 

4.2 Event 
  
Upon paying an event-creation deposit in AVT, the event creator (usually a promoter 
or  event  organiser)  uploads  the  event  details  to  the  Protocol,  together  with  a  URL 
which  references  all  supporting  information  for  the  validity  of  the  event.  This 
generates an Event ID on the blockchain. 
  
As  detailed  in  3.2.,  event  creators  have  the  option  to  create  private  events  (wherein 
they must sign off on any ticket sold), or to whitelist approved primary market sellers 
to interact with their inventory. Within the beta version of the Protocol, event creators 
cannot currently define revenue-split from ticket sales between different parties within 
the supply-chain. 
  
The reporting period and life-cycle of the event occur as outlined in 3.2.  

4.3 Ticket Sales 
The current definition of a ticket within the Protocol consists of: 
  

● Ticket ID: A sequential identifying number for each ticket per event. 
● Event  ID:  A  sequential  identifying  number  for  each  event  submitted  to  the 

Protocol. 

● Ticket  Details:  information  unique  and  specific  to  a  particular  ticket,  such  as 

seat number, entrance gate, ticket type. 

● Ticket Owner: the blockchain address of the ticket owner, who can be granted 

access to the ticketed event. 

● Ticket Status: an indicator showing whether the ticket is valid or not. 

  
As outlined in 3.1, the Ticket Details are sent to the Protocol along with the Event ID 
and Ticket Owner. The Protocol then generates a unique Ticket ID, which is stored on 
the blockchain and associated with the Ticket Owner.  

4.3.1 Secondary Market 
  
Within the current version of the Protocol, it is not yet possible for users to register an 
interest in buying a particular type of ticket, and no matching calculations have yet 
been implemented. 

4.4 Promotion 
  
The  commissioning  capabilities  discussed  in  3.6  have  not  been  implemented  in  the 
beta version of the Protocol.  

4.5 Market Price Oracle 
  
No  market  price  oracle  has  been  integrated  in  this  version;  this  process  is  currently 
carried out manually. 

 

5 Roadmap 

 5.1 The Story So Far 
An Alpha version of the Protocol providing scaled-down functionality was released on 
the Rinkeby Public TestNet in July 2017 for community review and comment. 
  
Full source-code for the Beta release was initially made available to the public in May 
2018. 
An  in-depth  audit  of  this  source-code  was  carried  out  by  Solidified.io,  the  leading 
technical  auditing  service  for  Ethereum  smart  contracts,  whose  150+  community  of 
Solidity  experts  has  previously  audited  over  40  companies  (including  Polymath, 
Melonport, Bankera and Spring Role). 
  
After undergoing a successful auditing process which exposed zero critical issues, the 
Protocol was deployed in Beta onto the Ethereum MainNet in June 2018. Developers 
can now access the Protocol and accompanying source-code, giving them the tools to 
begin  building  (or  expanding  existing)  ticketing  applications  and  services  to  take 
advantage of the benefits of blockchain. 

Within  beta,  some  elements  of  the  ecosystem  remain  centralised  while  we  iterate  and 
develop the Protocol (for example, see Section 4.1.3). From Version 1.0 onwards, once use 
of the Protocol has been established, control over system parameters will be handed to 
the AVT community, creating a fully decentralised solution.  

5.2 Looking to the Future 
  
Rather  than  define  a  precise  and  time-bound  product  roadmap,  Aventus  is  working 
actively and collaboratively with the ticketing industry to create an agile approach to 
the Aventus ecosystem based on client feedback and constant iteration. We believe 
this  is  the  right  way  to  test  and  challenge  assumptions  (both  the  industry’s  and  our 
own), educate (and learn from) key industry players, and ultimately drive blockchain 
adoption at a business and consumer level. We believe this demand-driven, business-
led approach means that the Protocol will become something of true value, which can 
revolutionise the ticketing industry from the bottom up. 

However, there are a number of services and solutions that we are currently working 
on and expect to implement as user-demand dictates. Some of these will be free-at-
the-point-of-use, whereas others will incur additional costs. Our current vision for the 
future and function of the Aventus solution architecture is detailed below, in Figure 4. 
The  future  solution  architecture  builds  upon  the  Aventus  ecosystem  as  detailed  in 

Section  2.1,  by  exploring  ways  to  make  the  Protocol  more  scalable,  accessible  and 
performant. 

 

Figure 4: Potential Future Architecture 

The  function  of  the  Protocol  itself  and  of  the  underlying  Ethereum  blockchain  has 
already been covered in detail in this paper, so will not be repeated here. 

5.2.1 AventusJS 
  
AventusJS is a JavaScript library which uses web3js to enable Ðapps to interact with 
the Aventus Protocol. It exposes APIs for all of the functionality of the Protocol without 
having to directly interact with the Ethereum blockchain using web3js or JSON RPC. 
By providing more familiar tools to work with, AventusJS lowers the barriers to entry 
for traditional developers (both internal and third-party) wishing to build blockchain-
enabled ticketing apps and services, by making it far easier to communicate with the 
Aventus Protocol.  

5.2.2 Scalability Tools 
  
A common criticism of the blockchain is that it is very slow (in computing terms), and 
difficult to scale. This is by design, due to its very nature as a distributed, peer-to-peer 
network  requiring  consensus  between  all  nodes.  Co-founder  of  Ethereum,  Vitalik 
Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum said earlier this year that “the Ethereum community, 
key  developers  and  researchers  and  others  have  always  recognized  scalability  as 
perhaps the single most important key technical challenge that needs to be solved in 
order for blockchain applications to reach mass adoption.” [33] 
  
Third-party professional service provider Artos Systems currently utilises a write-to API 
to handles this issue off-chain, by holding all transactions within a queueing system 
and  pushing  them  to  the  Protocol  incrementally.  The  API  also  monitors  current  gas 
prices on Ethereum, and utilises this information to optimise the flow of transactions 
based on cost. 
  
While  this  process  is  currently  handled  centrally,  third-party  service  providers  are 
actively  exploring  cutting-edge  decentralised  solutions,  both  by  developing  internal 
proof of concepts and evaluating new externally-developed options. 

5.2.3 Aventus Block Explorer 
  
The  Aventus  Block  Explorer  is  an  open-source  web  tool  that  provides  a  detailed 
overview of events and ticketing data stored on the Aventus Protocol via a read-only 
API. This allows users to get an easily accessible view of information on the Protocol 
for  reviewing,  reporting  and  analytical  purposes,  direct  from  the  browser,  without 
needing to interact directly with the Protocol itself.  

5.2.4 ÐApps Application Layer 
  
The  ÐApp  layer  is  concerned  with  the  creation  of  decentralised  applications  which 
optimise use of the Protocol and enable it to better fulfil its function. These will allow 
the  Aventus  ecosystem  to  better  fulfil  its  capacity  as  a  decentralised  due-diligence 
mechanism  for  the  entertainment  industry,  by  more  easily  enabling  the  Aventus 
community to engage with, analyse, and vote upon proposals.  

ÐApps will include elements such as: 
  

● Voting interfaces for issuing of and interaction with proposals and challenges. 
● Reporting and analytics functionality built upon Aventus Block Explorer. 
● Support for off-chain payments. 
● Automated matching processes for the secondary market on the Protocol (see 

Section 2.3.2). 

● Template  user  interfaces  for  third-party  developers  creating  their  own 

applications. 

5.2.5 Third-party B2B Application Layer 

  

The Aventus Protocol is open-source and freely available for all in the industry to benefit 
from. Third-party professional service providers, ticketing agencies and developers will be 
able  to  work  with  the  Protocol  to  develop  consumer-led,  blockchain-ready  ticketing 
applications. Ticketing providers wishing to engage with the Aventus Protocol can choose 
to: 

● Utilise their own in-house technical resources to build directly upon the Protocol, 
utilising the modules and toolkits provided by Aventus in on open source capacity. 
● Partner with third-party service providers and developers to leverage their internal 
expertise and existing services, in order to integrate with the Protocol more rapidly 
and  effectively  -  for  example  by  optimising  processes  around  scalability, 
cryptocurrency volatility, and key management. 

  

Some of the B2B apps currently being developed by third-parties, or with potential to be 
developed in the future, include: 

  

● Inventory management solutions 
● Consumer-ready, whitelabel blockchain ticket wallets 
● Ethereum account management platforms 
● SDKs  and  REST  APIs  enabling  faster  integration  with  existing  internal 

software and processes (already available) 

● Integration  with  micro-sales  channels  (e.g.  social  media,  music  streaming 

platforms) 

● Access control solutions incorporating a range of identification criteria 
● In-event advertising tools 
● Reputation calculators for promoters to aid commissioning decisions
