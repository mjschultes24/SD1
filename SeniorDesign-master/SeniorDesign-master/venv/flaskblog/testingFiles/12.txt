The online gambling industry was valued at USD 45.86 billion in 2016. However, it has two
 
major problems: ​the price ​of the gamble and ​transparency. The price of the individual
 
gamble comes from user-unfriendly rules: a large house edge of 1% - 15% (ref. Expn
 
Section nr. 1), money deposit/withdrawal fees and 2 - 3 days withdrawal delays. In addition,
 
there is no way of knowing what is happening inside the casino’s servers and how the
 
mechanisms are programmed. It can be easily rigged. Players need to rely on trusting the
 
 
casino, which is most likely not the best option in such a profit-driven industry. 
 
In 2008, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies solved the gambling price problem. Cryptocurrency
 
 
casinos are cost effective and can offer a 0.01% - 2% house edge, with instant money
 
 
transactions without any fees and anonymity. However, the ​transparency problem is still
 
 
there. Casinos can easily rig the game or hide profitability from the investors. 
 
Using Ethereum smart contracts (ref. Expn Section Nr. 1.5), we can have a low price per
 
gamble and solve the transparency problem. Random numbers and payouts can be ruled by
 
smart contracts which are fully public and implemented on an Ethereum blockchain. Now
 
 
players can see everything: transactions, sums, bets, the reasons why transactions are
moving and, most importantly, the mechanism of randomness. If the casino tried to rig the
 
odds, it would be immediately spotted. 
 
 
​zero edge casino to the market -
Our
 
 
Decentralised Edgeless Casino. At this point in time, there are no casinos like this in the
 
 
world. 
 
Our casino will offer a 0% edge with Blackjack, 0% edge with Video Poker, Micro-limit Dice
 
 
 
and Sports Betting. All games will be based on the Ethereum smart contract and will ensure
 
absolute transparency. 
 
The business will sustain itself in two ways:

1. From the players’ imperfect play. 
 

 

Blackjack and Video Poker are games of skill and luck. If players make perfect
decisions, they will reach a 0% edge. n average, however, a player makes mistakes,

so it will give a -0.83% edge to the casino and this 0.83% will be earned from the
 
 
money wagered. 
 

2. Sports Betting is about connecting players who are betting against each other and
 
taking the facilitation fee to manage the process. The fee depends on the game
 
types, the number of participants, bonuses and more. It is dynamic, floating in the
 
range of 0% - 10%. Approximately 4% is earned from the money wagered.

1. Price and Transparency Problems of Online
 
 
Gambling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
   

 
 
As stated before, in 2016 the online gambling industry was valued at USD 48.6 billion and
 
has shown steady growth each year. Most of a casino’s profits come from the “house edge”.
The House Edge is a term used to describe the mathematical advantage that the gambling
 
game (and therefore the commercial gambling venue) has over you as you play. This
 
advantage results in an assured percentage returned to the house over the duration of
 
playing time, and for you, it is an assured percentage loss of what you bet.  
 
Imagine that you are playing roulette and you bet $100 on the colour red. As roulette has a
   
number ZERO coloured in green which is neither red or black, the house gets an advantage
 
of 2.7% that is calculated thus: 
100 : (36 +1) = 2.7% 
 
 
So if the house has an edge, you ultimately lose every time. If you bet $10, your expected
   
loss is $0.27. In one hour, you can spin approximately 20 - 25 times. If every time you bet
 
$10, then in that hour you are expected to lose $5.4 - $6.75.  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
This loss can be calculated using the expected value (EV) formula:  
EV = (prob.win)(gain) - (prob.lose)(gain) 
 
Let’s say you are betting $10 on red which gives you an expected $20 win and $10 is your
 
 
expected loss. Roulette has 18 black fields, 18 red fields and 1 green zero. When you put all
 
the variables in the equations, this is what you get: 
 
EV = $20(18/37 )+ $0(19/37) = $9.73 + $0 = $9.73 
 
If you bet $10 on a roulette red, at the end of the game then you are expected to have $9.73.
 
 
And $0.27 is lost due to the house edge. 
 
This means that for each $10 that you bet, you are giving away 27 cents to the house. Of
 
course in real life, numbers do not hit exactly like that and we may have a bigger range of
 
 
wins and loses. However, if we merge the data from all players and calculate it in the long
 
run, then the EV shows the actual sum that casinos are profiting from.  
 
The house edge is different for each game.  
Here you can find a list of games and house edges. 
 
 
Technically, the ‘house edge’ is the price that people pay for the gambling experience as a
 
 
whole. Which is not that big if your bets are reasonable and you are playing in Las Vegas.
There are tourists who get free drinks, free meals, night entertainment shows, good travel
 
deals and many more benefits such as instant cash deposits and withdrawals. 
 
However, online casinos are almost a different industry in comparison. You don’t get good
 
travel deals or free meals, and players pay more for the raw experience of just the gamble
 
itself. The mathematical house edge is the same, but you have to pay for extras, such as
 
depositing money and withdrawal fees (most online casinos charge). Furthermore, there is
 
usually a delay with regards to withdrawing and casinos usually take 2 - 3 days to send you
 
the money. That barrier to taking your money out of the virtual casino immediately becomes
 
 
how the industry profits even more. In a real casino - if you win a decent sum of money, you
can rush to the cashier, cash out in seconds and celebrate your win. In an online casino, you

know that you cannot celebrate your win right away and need to wait. During that waiting
 
 
time, a lot of people come back to the table and lose their winnings. 
 
The worst part - even with all of the money making tools available (deposit, withdraw fees,
 
withdraw delays, house edge), it’s not enough for the industry. On some occasions, they
 
even rig the odds to increase the house edge significantly and scam money from their own
 
players. ​Currently there is no way of checking the transparency of a casino. 
 
To sum up, we have two major problems in the online gambling industry: the price of the
gamble and house transparency. As this industry is growing rapidly, these problems become
 
ever more relevant. 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.1. Rise of the Cryptocurrency Reduce the Gamble Price 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

One of the reasons why online casinos have a deposit fee, withdrawal fees and extended
 
withdrawal times are to do with problems related to traditional forms of currency such as
 
USD and EUR. To move traditional currency from one account to the other is expensive. It
 
 
has to go through many third parties and regulators which take their bit out of every
 
transaction. In 2008, cryptocurrency Bitcoin came to life and started changing a lot of areas
 
of our lives including the online gambling industry. By providing instant and low cost currency
 
transactions, Bitcoin became a game changer for online casinos. Now, anyone can a run
 
casino and offer services without any extra fees with instant money deposits/withdrawals
 
and full anonymity. Some rooms offer a house edge that is lower than 1%, which is more of
 
a fair bet. This significantly improves the quality of the gamble as a whole. 
 
That’s why cryptocurrency-based online casinos are on the rise. Right now, we have more
 
than 100 rooms based on a cryptocurrency which accounts for 10 billion bets and is growing
 
 
each year. In fact, 60% of all Bitcoin transactions are gambling-related. However, one major
problem has not been solved yet: ​transparency​. Even after the cost of the gamble has been
 
reduced significantly, we still have many rooms rigging the odds and stealing from
 
customers. Famous cases of Bitcoin casinos rigging the odds can be founder​ ​here​ and​ ​here. 
So, one major problem is left: transparency.

1.2. Fairness Check’s Problems and Limitations 

1.2.1 Random Number Generator 

1.2.1.1. Explanation of Fairness Check 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
   

 
   

 
Online casinos create a random number using a combination of casino and client numbers.
The casino assigns their own number automatically and the visitor can do it manually or let
 
the casino decide for them. The two numbers are blended to provide a random outcome.
 
 
The idea behind it is that the casino can rig their own number, but they would not be able to
rig the client’s number and therefore the outcome will be random. Therefore a casino would
 
not able to cheat.  
 
Oversimplified example: casino is assigned a number (also known as a seed), visitor assigns
 
the other number (seed). The visitor can set it manually before every game or let the casino
 
decide. Both numbers are blended into one number and using a formula (it’s unknown to the
 
player and determined by the casino otherwise the player could predict the final outcome) -
   
the random number is generated. After the game, visitors can use a special key (hash,
 
information access code/label/tag) to access the information related to that game and see
 
what seeds were blended and which number was generated as the result.  

 
   
 

 
   

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.2.1.2. Loops in Fairness Check 

 

 

1) The casino can easily influence the client’s seed by assigning it themselves (that’s
 
the case in most casinos, because an average player is not going to type and give a
 
   
random number before every gamble round - even if they have this option) 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2) The client entered the seed once and is not changing it. The casino can identify it
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and use that information to adjust their own seed. 

3) The casino can delay creating their own seed and provide it to the ‘blender’ once the

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

visitor has sent theirs. Then the casino can adjust their own seed to the client’s. 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
Even if client sees that the ‘randomness’ of the casino is on the right track, the casino still
 
has the ability to freeze a player's account without reason and steal the deposit, since these
 
 
actions depend on humans’ decisions but not on non-changeable fully transparent and
decentralised smart contracts. There are so many ways of cheating that it is clear that a new
 
generation of online casinos is needed.

1.2.2 Bitcoin Casino Can Also Drain Investors Profits  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

A lot of cryptocurrency casinos offer investment opportunities for people. They can invest
 
into the casino's bankroll and get a share of a casino’s profits. All cryptocurrency
 
transactions are public on the blockchain so it is easy to see the exact profits every day.
 
That’s why this investment looks really attractive. However, there is a way that casinos can
 
drain profits from their wallet and pay less to investors.  
 
In 2016, they made
For example, a casino shares 50% of
 
$1,000,000$ profit and $500,000 should therefore go to the investors. However, the casino
 
 
 
 
 
wants to cheat and pay less. They can easily drain money from the casino’s wallet into a
 
 
 
different wallet which belongs to them and no-one would even suspect that it has happened.
 
 
They would do this by: 
 

to its investors.

1. Casino owner enters his own online casino with a new account and different wallet. 
2. Casino edits code in casino server and riggs odds ONLY for that new account. 
3. Casino wins against casino and leaves. 
4. The casino pays less profit share to its investors, because they think casino just had
 
 
a loss and someone got lucky. But they have no idea that the lucky person is the
 
 
owner of the casino. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
Blockchain can see all transactions and the sums transferred. However they cannot see the
 
reasons why transactions are moving or what is happening inside the casino’s server. This
 
scheme can be done in low sums and systematically over the year. At the end of the year,
 
investors would see the total casino’s profit and calculate the EV based on their edge. f a
   
 
casino’s profits are 10% less than expected, however, no one would suspect that the owner
 
took it. And 10% from half a million is $50,000. That is one way that casinos can lower their
 
public profits and steal money as a result. 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.3. Edgeless Casino Solution 

 

 

 

 

 
 

This is why we will be developing Edgeless - a next generation casino. Edgeless casino will
 
 
 
be built on the Ethereum blockchain. All of the key operations will be regulated by smart
 
contracts, giving users a fully transparent experience.

We will be using the client’s seed and our own seed to generate randomness. The main
 
difference with Bitcoin Casinos will be that users will know our hashed (SHA512) seed
 
before betting and before generating their own client seeds. Because of that there is no way
 
 
for us to alter the results. After bet is made, client will be able to see our unhashed seed on
Ethereum Blockchain and verify the randomness. Moreover, clients will have two options for
 
getting random seeds. The first one is to type it in manually before every game; this would
 
eliminate any ability to cheat the clients. The second one, which will be used by default, is to
 
 
generate different client seeds automatically for every game by using an API integration with
random.org. Smart contracts will be publicly available on the blockchain for everyone to
 
 
examine and to test its randomness procedure. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
1.4. Edgeless Based on Ethereum Smart Contracts - Full
Transparency  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

In 2015, the creation of the Ethereum smart contract is another major game changer for
 
online gambling. Right now, we can solve the transparency issue once and for all. Using a
 
 
smart contract, there is no way that casinos can rig the odds even if they wanted to. That
 
means in 2017, we can have “THE PERFECT ONLINE CASINO” which can offer 0% house
 
edge and 100% transparency. That’s a next generation gambling product which is the best in
 
a current market and does not exist. Yet. 
 
The real power of smart contracts is that if they are properly implemented on Ethereum
 
Blockchain, they will act each and every time how they are supposed to. That is truly
 
 
trust-flawless technology that eventually all online casinos will be using. Also, it is near
impossible to censor smart contracts, because they are placed in a decentralized
 
infrastructure. All Ethereum smart contracts will be publicly available for everyone to see and
 
examine. 
 
Our Edgeless tokens will be sold via Ethereum-based smart contracts. This means that all
 
 
 
 
investors will be 100% sure that if they send 100 ethers to the Crowdsale smart contract,
then they will get 12,000 EDG tokens during our power hour sale guaranteed. 
 
In the same trustworthy way that our casino will be operated, if a user bets on a particular
 
game, they can be 100% sure that their result will be truly random and that they will get their

Business Offering 0% House Edge?

Most casino games do not require any skill to play or change the odds like roulette, dice, and
slots. However, there are a few games which combine luck and skill. By providing more
 
options - blackjack, video poker - players can influence house edge. That means that the
 
house edge depends on the skill level of the player. Blackjack is the game which has the
 
lowest casino edge (0.6%) if played perfectly. The average player, however, does not play
 
 
the ‘perfect game’ and they make mistakes. Black Jack provides a variety of decisions to the
player and based on that, they can increase or decrease their chance of winning. On
 
 
average, a player makes mistakes which are equivalent of 1.43%. If we offer a 0% house
edge game, mistakes count for a 0.83% house edge. That means on every $100 bet, an
 
average player gives 83 cents to the house.

2.2. Gambler's’ Ruin and Variance 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
   

 
Gambler’s ruin adds an extra profit to the casino. A gambler with finite wealth playing a fair
game (both sides have equal chance of winning - 0% house edge) would lose against an
 
 
opponent with infinite wealth. It’s quite simple; a larger bankroll can absorb higher levels of
variance. And small bankrolls can’t. That means a small player would bust more even if the
 
casino has a 0% edge. 
 
Let’s take an example: 
“Assume that the player makes a deposit of $1000 to an online casino, and wants to bet till
 
 
 
he reaches $5000 that has been wagered. If the player is to willing to play through 500
 
hands, then his average bet size would be $5000/500 = $10. The number of betting units
 
 
would be $1000/$10 = 100. The table shows the risk of ruin is 0.01% for 102 units, so would
be just over 0.01% for 100. Perhaps this is too conservative, so the player considers playing
 
200 hands. The bet size is now $5000/200 = $25. The number of units is $1000/$25 = 40.
 
Interpolating the table shows the risk of ruin would be 1.5%.”

At this stage, we cannot estimate the profits coming from the gambler’s ruin effect. It strongly
 
depends on the type of players gambling in the casino and their bankroll management skills. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.3. How will We Reduce an Edge to 0%? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

Casino has a blackjack edge because they have best decision making position - the last
 
one. That means that players can bust before the house even draws a card. To compensate
 
 
for this edge, the house gives additional bonuses to the player such as 1 to 3 payoff in the
case of blackjack, and the ability to double bet if casino has a bad card. That’s exactly what
 
we will do - increase these additional bonuses by reducing house edge to 0%. Actually such
 
game models already exist - Voyages Casino has one. However, they charge 10% for
 
 
money withdraws and there is no way of knowing if they are rigging the odds or not.

2.4. Games Provided by Edgeless Casino 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

   
 

Based on results of the Crowdsale, these are the following games which Edgeless Casino
will offer. 
 
0% Edge Blackjack and Video Poker - the payout structure will be changed in favour of the
 
player, so the house edge would be reduced to ZERO. Here, you can play a demo of zero
 
edge blackjack:  https://betvoyager.com/games/equal-odds/ 
 
Micro Limits dice. The game rules result in a 0.05% edge. In the first year, players will be
 
allowed to bet only micro sums. The concept is similar to most bitcoin dice casinos, however
 
the payout structure will be fairer. If you bet 1BTC on 50%, most Bitcoin casinos will offer
 
 
1.98x payout. We will offer a 1.995x fair bet payout.  
 
Sports Betting - it’s not really a traditional casino gambling game, but in order to attract a
 
wider scope of people, we want to offer more games.

In the future, we will expand on the games offered by our casino. 

3. “Edgeless Lounge” and EDG tokens  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Edgeless Casino is based on ETH currency. Each month 40% of casino profits will be sent
to the “Edgeless Lounge” prize pool. Transfer process will be guided automatically using a
 
 
smart contract. 
 
 
EDG token holders can access the “Edgeless Lounge” game lottery and compete for the
prize pool. At 3 PM GMT, on the 28th day of each month, winners will be announced and the
 
pool distributed among winners. The lottery process will take no more than 2 minutes. At
 
3:02 PM lottery participants can claim their prize. 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.1. Lounge game concept  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

For example: 
2018’s lounge game prize pool is 150,000 ETH. There are 500,000,000 EDG tokens in total
 
 
which can compete to win a share of the prize pool. In this particular scenario:  
 
100,000 EDG tokens can win 150,000 / 500,000,000 x 100,000 = 30 ETH  
Formula: (“Edgeless Lounge” prize pool) / (Total EDG tokens issued) x EDG tokens bet 
 
 
 
Each month, before 3 PM GMT on the 28th, players need to send their EDG tokens to a
game smart contract. Winners will be announced after 2 minutes and players will be able to
 
 
claim their prize.

IMPORTANT: Players cannot lose their EDG tokens. Tokens are like an entry ticket to
 
 
 
participate in a lounge game. The more EDG tokens you have, the larger the share of the
 
 
 
prize pool you can win. EDG tokens can be deposited or withdrawn via lottery smart contract
 
any time. If players bet or deposit EDG tokens after 3 PM on the 28th, the bet participates in
 
the next month’s lottery.  
 
Let’s say only 75% of all tokens (370,000,000) participate in a game. What happens to a
 
 
share of the prize pool which isn’t won? It rolls over to the new prize pool which will be
 
available to win next month. In this scenario that would be 37,500 Ethereum.  
 
“Edgeless Lounge” game prize formula: 40% of casino profits + ETH left from the previous
 
month’s prize pool.

4. Edgeless Casino Business Plan 

4.1. Market Potential 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

 
To sum up all of the facts mentioned in the sections above: the online gambling casino
industry is valued at USD 45.86 billion and is expected to grow up to USD 56 billion in 2018.
 
Every year, more and more market share of that is going into cryptocurrency gambling
 
solutions. Right now, 60% of all BTC transactions are made for gambling purposes. And the
 
industry has two major problems: transparency and price of the online gamble.  
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

● At this point, online casinos have full power to cheat without being spotted.  
● At this point, players need to pay deposit/ withdrawal fees, wait for payouts and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gamble on 1% - 15% house edge. 

 
It all can be changed with the Edgeless Ethereum-based Casino.

4.2. Marketing Plan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

We do believe that having the best product/best offer is the key. Our team is planning to
 
 
offer perfect gambling conditions: 0% house edge and ultimate transparency (Ethereum
based smart contracts). Right now, there is no product like that in the market - our casino will
 
be the first one. 
 
Our main marketing messages: 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

● Perfect gambling experience with 0% house edge 
● Fully transparent casino based on Ethereum 
● Fast gaming like on Bitcoin casinos even though Edgeless is based on Ethereum
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blockchain 

● 0% Edge BlackJack, 0% Edge Video Poker 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
In the first stage, we will target gamblers who are already familiar with cryptocurrencies. In
 
the next stage, we expect to attract a large proportion of gamblers from traditional casinos.
 
We will accept main cryptocurrencies by implementing a “Shapeshift” converter and will also
 
pay attention when it comes to attracting and accepting fiat currencies. Most people are
 
already furious from all of the drawbacks that regular casinos have. 
 
 
After the successful Crowdsale, we will put a lot of focus into product development, legal
 
procedures and capturing
market share from other cryptocurrency casinos. The
 
 
development process, business operations, and legal procedures will take 4-6 months. After
 
 
all of the preparation procedures of Edgeless Casino’s development and licensing, we will
 
implement mass-scale marketing strategies. All marketing efforts will be put in to attract
 
 
people from cryptocurrency and traditional online casinos, in turn boosting the overall

popularity of cryptocurrencies and fair gambling. Having a 0% Edge Casino is a strong
 
advantage to attract users to Edgeless Casino, where they can find many other gambling
 
and betting games. One of these will be Sports betting, which will have a 4% commision fee. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.3. Profit Forecasts (ROI %)  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

We offer games which are a combination of skill and luck. If players will play the perfect
 
basic blackjack strategy, they will reach 0% house edge. However, that’s not the case for an
 
average player. From an average player, because of his mistakes ​(read it here)​, we expect
 
to get a 0.83% house edge. In the later development stages, we will introduce sports betting
 
 
which will drive an additional stream of profit. Sports betting is connecting players who are
 
 
betting against each other and we would take the juice/rake/vig for process facilitation. It’s
 
similar to the ‘rake’ used by poker rooms. The sports betting vig will depend on the game
type, the number of participants, bonuses and more. It is dynamic, floating in the range of
 
0% - 10%. In our casino, we aim to have 5% of all money wagered be placed as a sports bet
 
 
with 4% ROI. 

 
 
   

 
 
 
 

 
   

 
   

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5. Crowdsale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
The Crowdsale of Edgeless and the corresponding token creation process will be organised
 
around the smart contracts running on Ethereum. Participants willing to support
the
 
the Edgeless Casino Project can do so by sending Ethereums to the
development of
 
 
designated address. By doing so, they are purchasing Edgeless Tokens (EDG) at the rate of
 
1 000 EDG per 1 ETH which are sent instantly to their wallet.   
 
Crowdsale ends when the end date (21th March 2017, 4:00 pm GMT) is reached, or when
 
 
the total amount of supplied Edgeless tokens (440 000 000 EDG) are sold. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If the Crowdsale campaign does not reach its capital goal of 50 000 EHT or the equivalent,
 
 
 
all funds will be returned to the EDG holders by the Ethereum smart contracts.

5.2. Announcement of Crowdsale beginning 

The Crowdsale beginning will be announced through the following channels: 
 

● Project webpage: edgeless.io 
● Official Twitter: twitter.com/edgelessproject 
● Official Slack: edgelesscasino.slack.com 
● Reddit: reddit.com/r/edgeless 

 

5.3. Edgeless Tokens (EDG) 

 

 

 

 
issue 500,000,000 Edgeless tokens (EDG). Edgeless tokens will be an
Edgeless will
Ethereum-based token of value. The tokens are a digital asset, bearing value by themselves
 
 
based on their underlying assets, properties and/or associated rights. Edgeless tokens
 
represent ownership rights to the dividends of Edgeless Casino. 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ethereum-based tokens rely on a well-established Ethereum infrastructure, benefiting from
several advantages: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

● Security and predictability (as opposed to,
 

 

 

 

 

 

independent blockchain network); 

for example, having to run an
 

 

 

 

 

 

● Use of robust and well supported clients (Ethereum-based tokens can be
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
managed with official Ethereum clients): 

 

 

● High liquidity ​(interchangeable with other Ethereum- based tokens or Ether); 

easier listing on exchanges with infrastructure already in place; 

● Ethereum smart contracts enable a very ​transparent​ and ​secure​ way of ​profit- 

sharing​ among the token holders.  
 
   
Our Ethereum-based token contract complies with the ERC20 standard, which means that it
is extremely easy for exchanges involving trading edgeless tokens to happen. More detailed

The first hour of the Crowdsale will be a Power Hour. During the Power Hour, 1 Ether will
 
buy 1200 EDG. After that, the price will change to 1100:1, and then decrease every week
 
until it reaches 1000:1 in the third week:

5.6. Development Roadmap 
 
1. Phase - 50 000 ETH 
 
 
In the first phase, we will develop 0% house edge Blackjack and the "Edgeless Lounge". The
Lounge will ensure a decentralized price pool which is backed by 40% of casino profits.
 
 
People will have a chance to win it using our EDG tokens. Another part of investment will be
allocated to the casino bankroll/bank so the casino can pay out wins for the first wave of
 
visitors. Learn more 
 
2. Phase - 110 000 ETH 
 
 
At this phase, most of the funds will be allocated towards security/hacker prevention and
increased size of Edgeless Casino’s bankroll so that it can payout any larger wins. A bigger
 
 
bankroll means a larger betting range for visitors and more wagered money as a result. 
 
3. Phase - 190 000 ETH 
 
 
We will work on the development of a new game - 0% house edge video poker. It is based
on luck and skill, the same as Blackjack. The second game is a micro limit dice - a pure luck
 
game. 
 
4 Phase - 250 000 ETH 
 
This phase is all about the sports betting development. It has a smaller scale but better ROI
 
 
than traditional games. Our Edgeless way will offer a much lower edge than other casinos.
 
Sports betting will be so that our casino can stay competitive. 
 
5 Phase - 360 000 ETH 
 
 
The Grand Vision - a platform for developers where they can easily take our tools and
develop their own fully transparent casinos so cryptocurrency and blockchain can become
 
the standard of the casino industry. And later on, the standard of the world.
