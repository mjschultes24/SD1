1. INTRODUCTION
In January 2018, the market value of cryptocurrency exceeded $
800 billion. Although this is a new industry with relatively low
awareness, the transaction volume, however, has reached more
than $ 15 billion daily on large trading platforms such as Binance
and OKEx, Huobi. This demonstrates a strong and sustainable
growth in trend.
The development of cryptocurrency is consequently leading to
further refinements in trading platforms. However, on of the current
issues for these platforms is the increasing threat of hackers
attacks on trading platforms in order to steal coins. Investors still
do not have a safe and reliable trading environment.
Therefore, Extradecoin has been established with the desire to

2A. ADDITIONAL EXTRADECOIN’S FEATURES
To increase profitability for investors, Extradecoin
will play the role of an intermediary, in a platform
that connects lenders and borrowers. Investors
may have unused cash in their Extradecoin wallet
and so can lend to other to each other to earn
additional monthly income. Investors, who wish to
increase their capital and are looking for new
investments, can contact Extradecoin to discover
appropriate loans.
2B. BORROWING PLATFORM
Interest-bearing loan mechanism
Investors who wish to lend funds can contact Extradecoin to lend their coins. The lowest loan value will be $
1000 (based on the price of lent coin on Extradecoin at that time). The loan information will be publicly
available on Extradecoin and includes the name of the coin borrowed, loan duration, amount, interest rate, etc.
However, personal information about lenders will not be public to protect their privacy rights. When borrowers
accept a loan, a computer algorithm will proceed to the next step. At each maturity date, lenders will receive
interest on their account. The borrower pays this interest using the same coin the investor has lent.
Each loan is subject to a specified loan term and interest rate by the following table (interest rate fluctuations
will depend on the time and type of loan that the investor lends and borrows)
Time 1 Month 2 Months 3 Months
Interest 2-3% 4-6% 6-9%
2B. BORROWING PLATFORM
Margin mechanism
Investors who wish to borrow money on Extradecoin will need to find appropriate loans based on the
platform’s regulations. The condition for borrowing is that investors must at least possess at least the amount
of coins they intend to borrow. This is a the margin that will be used to guarantee the investors’ loan.
Borrowers will be able to get a coin loan with the registered coin and, at the same time, interest will be paid by
the registered coin back to lenders. For example, an investor holds ETH; they can borrow ETH loans in ETH
and pay interest monthly using ETH.
Investors can borrow up to the amount they deposit, meaning they will own double the amount and investors
can use all of this money to trade.
Each month, investors will have to pay interest according to the terms of the loan. The interest will be
deducted directly from borrower’s accounts on the interest payment date. At the maturity date, the investor
must pay both principal and interest as agreed initially, plus a 1% transaction fee.
2B. BORROWING PLATFORM
Margin mechanism
Note: During the loan period, if investors lose 30% of
their initial capital, their current account transactions
will be stopped immediately. The remaining amount
will be deducted to pay back the capital and interest
plus a 1% transaction fee.

Background
In the early 1990s, the gaming market value was estimated at $ 100 million with several million players. Since
then, the gaming industry has experienced tremendous growth.
In 2017, the worldwide gaming market is valued at $ 121.7 billion. According to forecasts by Newzoo (Global
Game, Phone and eSports Market Research), this figure will increase to $ 180.1 billion in 2021.

Background

2C. TOKEN PLAY
Main problems of the Gaming industry today
• Many payment methods are not accepted worldwide or in some countries of the world. The regulations
for international transactions are quite complex.
• Gamers need to go through intermediaries/3rd parties to make a payment in game e,g Banks, Financial
companies ...; This causes high transaction fees, long transaction times. The higher the volume, the more
transaction costs are incurred.
• Deposit/withdrawal limits.
• Gamer’s security is rather low. Account information is vulnerable to hacking or the risk of being exposed
by game developers (aka private information trading)
• In traditional games, the digital assets that gamers possess are stored on the developer's server, i.e., the
gamer does not own it, and game developers can interfere or delete the player's account at any time
without any reason or warning.
• Transfers between players are limited.
2C. TOKEN PLAY
Token Play
Extradecoin understands users’ needs for
entertainment hence we have integrated our

ecosystem-based exclusively on the Extradecoin
platform. Investors who have ETH, BTC or another
coin that’s available on the Extradecoin platform
can participate in Token Play. Games on
Extradecoin will use ETE tokens for transactions
and payments. Gamers can easily buy or sell ETE
on the exchange. Token Play will cooperate with
various Game publishers on Blockchain platforms
to integrate into Extradecoin. We will try to support
all types of games to bring gamers the best
experience.
Token Play will have many games such as game
pictures, game strategy, game imitation, game bet...
2C. TOKEN PLAY

items or accessories purchased by the

Extradecoin administrator can access and
change it.
2C. TOKEN PLAY
The role of the ETE token in Token Play
ETE is the optimized solution for Extradecoin's blockchain games. It helps to remove most of the difficulties that
gamers face when playing games.Besides the advantages of an advance payment method and flexible trading
mechanism, ETE is also a property that the Gamer owns when participating in Token Play. Gamers will be given
100 ETEs for to each newly created account. Additionally, Gamers will receive rewards, bonuses from the game
paid by ETE. Tokens can be resold on the Extradecoin platform, kept to make more profit or simply hold by
gamers to continue playing the games on Token Play. ETE also helps to encourage gamers to participate more
in these games. The more they play, the better chance they will have of acquiring additional ETE tokens which
generates profit. Therefore, Token Play not only brings entertainment to gamers but also creates additional value
or even “investment” value.
2C. TOKEN PLAY
Integrate and introduce new ICO projects to the
community.
Investors can use ETH to buy ICO project tokens
they want. These ETH will be transferred to the ICO
managers, and they will transfer the token back to
the investor.
When the ICO ends, investors can use this token to
trade on Extradecoin.
This will help investors to easily access and buy the
token, but we also help investors that wish to sell
tokens whilst the ICO is underway. This means that
investors who buy tokens in a pre-sale phase and
keep them in "MyEtherWallet" can sell them when
the token is not yet officially traded on the market.

3D. TOKEN REPURCHASING
Multi-signature wallet
Extradecoin will introduce a multi-signature wallet services on client accounts. Multi-signature is a highly
advanced technology for private information security.
These wallets will consist of two private keys: one held by the user and the other is held by Extradecoin. All
private keys will be stored on a separate server.
All withdrawal activities will be closely observed. A withdrawal transaction will only be successful if a
consensus is reached by both Extradecoin and the customers.
This will prevent double-spends when a user intentionally conducts withdrawals greater than their existing
balance.
To conclude, multi-signature is the ultimate security mechanism that enables to protect their account even if
it becomes infected by a malicious code. Hackers, who illegally intend to invade private computers or steal
passwords, will not be able to get our clients money.

System security
Extradecoin employs Amazon Web Services' security mechanisms. Extradecoin systems requires account
authentication, client identification, and 2FA security to log in. Different individual systems cannot interact
with each other unless approved and monitored.

Extradecoin uses cold-wallet storage to protect the
client's crypto assets. A cold-wallet stores crypto and
simultaneously disconnects internet connections to
remove any unwanted hacker intrusion.
Assets stored on the platform will guarantee that
transactions activities are running continuously. At
the same time, a cold-wallet will be used as a
high-security mechanism in cases of high transaction
activities are going on.
Cold-wallet and multi-signature technology are two of
the core elements used together to create the
ultimate security system for customer assets. This
mechanism ensures that all cash flow is properly
observed and fully transparent
