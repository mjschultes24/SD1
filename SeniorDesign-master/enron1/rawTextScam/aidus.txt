Ⅰ. INTRODUCTION
The  growth  of  the  Internet  in  early  2000  opened  the  era  of  new  technological
innovation called the “venture boom”. Of course, it caused such problems as the dot-
com bubble, but as a result, it has become a page in the history as the “Third Industrial
Revolution”. Now when in less than 20 years, the society has again entered the era of
the "Fourth Industrial Revolution". Many Blockchain technologies are currently being
developed and major companies as well as start-up companies are carrying out ICOs
with their own various technologies and know-hows.
The  entire  society  is  witnessing  with  its  own  eyes  the  fast  growth  of  this  unique
industry and market in somewhat similar or somewhat faster pace than that of the
semiconductor market or the SMART phone market.
However, the cold reality is that most countries have not even settled into the basic
legal framework regarding the ICO, and it has only been recently that lawmakers are
now establishing a consensus in the general regulatory direction in this market.
The global trend of ICO and as well as various anxieties and side effects regarding
cryptocurrency is general are already widely known to the public, but for the AIDUS
Project  Team,  who  have  long  been  carrying  out  research  on  the  ICO  and  on  the
Tokenomics, there has been a focus on the following three major limitations.
1.  Absence of basic fundamentals in cryptocurrency
2.  Price volatility issue in speculative market
3.  Absence of future value as being unable to be used in real economy
The AIDUS Project Team has focused on the need of innovative alternative to the above
three major limitations to the current cryptocurrency, and has explored on the following
major contemplation.
1. Is it impossible to create a coin that can not only secure the future value but also
to instill the fundamentals?
2. What business model would enable both the listing of the coin in the exchange
and as well as an immediate usage and application in the real economy?
5




It  was  never  an  easy  task  even  to  the  AIDUS  Project  Team  with  the  core
competitiveness within the team to go through various alternative models and as well
as to create a business model that can satisfy the above two major questions.
The business model that has been prepared in the early ICO stages could not have been
pushed  forward,  and  as  well  as  other  various  business  models  as  it  could  not  go
through the rigorous analysis from professionals, legal consulting, and technological
evaluation process.
However,  the  final  model  of  the  AIDUS  Global  D-Fund  Platform  (ADFP)  has  been
developed  with  an  assurance  to  be  the  successful  alternative  model  satisfying  the
above  contemplation  and  as  well  as  to  the  leading  innovative  business  model  that
would propel the global asset management market.
Beyond  the  ‘Renaissance  Technologies’,  the  Blue  Chip  in  Hedge
Funds, is no longer just a ‘Dream’ for our team.
The core competitiveness of the AIDUS Project Team is the technologies and know-
hows in stably securing profits through the FOREX (Foreign Exchange) margin trading
system  in  the  FOREX  market,  enabling  the  AIDUS  to  penetrate  the  single  largest
market in the entire world, the global asset management.
The AIDUS Project Team has gone through 15 years of R&D process for the proprietary
Quant Trading System (hereby referred to as “QTS”), fully launching the system in 2015,
and has been fully verified since  2016  by various asset management professionals
through  demonstration  of  the  system  and  as  well  as  pilot  operation  on  the  fund
management, fully verifying the safety of the system.
By connecting the AIDUS Global D-Fund Platform  (ADFP) which is operated with the
single currency of the AIDUS Coin with the QTS that has recorded a remarkable yield
rate for the past 3 consecutive years, the core innovations that the system will bring to
the  current  cryptocurrency  market  and  the  asset  management  market  can  be
summarized as following.
6




▶ Protection of coin holders (investors) through a coin model that equips the coin with
fundamentals
▶ Realization of real currency value of the coin by enabling actual usage in the asset
management (real economy)
▶ Enabling decentralized fund market service providing a free access for signing and
redemption of global fund items
▶ Providing various fund portfolios that are safe and high in yield rate to the entire
world
By carrying out the above tasks and features, the AIDUS Global D-Fund Platform(ADFP)
shall provide a true innovation that would tackle various problems that were inherent in
the existing cryptocurrencies and as well as various pain points for in the investors and
asset management companies.
This innovation will surely enable the AIDUS Project team to expand far beyond the current
leading enterprises in the global asset management market, to be the next leading group
for the upcoming new era of global market.

Ⅱ. AIDUS COMMENTARY
High profit asset management through the proprietary QTS
“Decentralized Global Fund Market Platform (ADFP)”
This  project,  officially  named  as  the                                                   ‘AIDUS  Global  D-Fund  Platform  (ADFP)’,  is
decentralized platform business by establishing a ‘decentralized fund market platform’
in which the AIDUS Coin will serve as the main currency that would be used for the
signing and redemption of various fund portfolios. The platform will connect global
investors  (the  demand  group  for  the  asset  management)  with  professional  asset
management companies, while it would supply the ‘Quant Trading System(QTS)’ to the
asset management companies in order for them to create various high profit fund
items, all aiming at truly revolutionizing and establishing a new ecosystem of global
asset management market.
This ‘ADFP Business’ is the first ever unique project in the entire world that can only be
pushed forward by the unique members here in the AIDUS Project Team.
1. Limitations of the Global Asset Management Market
According to the Financial Times on October  30th  2017, the international consulting
firm PwC(Pricewaterhouse Coopers) has announced that the global asset management
market size is USD 85 trillion as of October 2017 and it is expected to expand to USD
145 trillion by 2025. For comparison of the figure, according to the data released by the
International Monetary Fund(IMF) on the global GDP figures for 2017, the total output
of the top 20 countries is estimated at about USD 90 trillion.
This shows that the total volume of GDP of the top 20 countries is similar to the current
global  asset  management  market  volume,  which  constitutes  to  the  single  largest
market in the entire world.
Assuming stream of low interest rates are maintained and economic growth continues,
the size of the global asset management market will continue to expand due to the
pension savings due to aging and the increase in personal assets in emerging markets.

[ Figure 1 ] AuM Forecast by World Regions
Source) ‘Asset & Wealth Management Revolution: Embracing Exponential Change’,PwC, 2017.10
Although the scale of US asset management is still very large, it is predicted that the
growth of Asia-Pacific and Latin America will accelerate in the future.
-  Asia-Pacific: 8.7% growth from 2016 to 2020, 11.8% growth from 2020 to 2025
-  Latin America: 7.5% growth from 2016 to 2020, 10.4% growth from 2020 to 2025
Therefore, there are many asset management companies around the world, and they
are creating various types of fund portfolios. However, if an investor would ask, "is it
possible to find a good fund for investment among these countless number of funds?",
the answer will probably always be ‘very difficult’.
Even if there is a good fund portfolio abroad, there is no way to check which country is
actually operating the fund and what kind of portfolio it is. Plus, the language barrier
issue makes it near-impossible to know whether the fund management is aggressive or
stable, whether it is a mixed type of bond and stock or a single portfolio on foreign
exchange.  Going  further,  it  becomes  way  more  difficult  when  a  person  tries  to
understand  professional  /  legal  terms  and  jargons  when  signing  into  the  contract
agreements, so accurate information is definitely not readily available for the investors.
9




For these reasons, most individual investors rely on the advice of fund sales companies
to invest into fund portfolios and although there are cases of appropriate customized
portfolio  suggestion  based  on  the  analysis  of  investment  propensities  and  on  the
specific needs of the investors, there are also quite a number of cases, in which only
seller-customized products are suggested only to contribute to the performance of the
fund sales company or the employee himself/herself.
In addition, since investors and asset management companies don’t necessarily are
based in one single country, but rather it is often the case that the investors sign into
global funds created by other asset management companies around the world, it is the
general case that the investors will need to make a total of 2-tier exchanges, and if not
based on the key currency, 4-tier exchanges might be required. Going further, since
there is no specifically dedicated account like the stock market system, the investors
will need to exchange the money again if they would wish to reinvest into the fund.
These  obstacles  in  the  current  system  basically  mean  that  it  is  impossible  for  an
individual or an institution to personally select, sign in, and order a redemption for a
fund  item  operated  by  a  foreign  asset  management  company.  This,  in  other
perspective, points out that there is a strong demand and needs for a decentralization
in the global asset management market through the Blockchain technologies.
Now, as for the asset management companies, the issue in their perspective is that
huge marketing budgets are needed in order to promote their fund portfolios to the
global  market  and  to  connect  with  each  different  fund  sales  company  in  many
countries, all applied with different and unique sales commission structures, and as well
as to develop a real time-basis connection system to manage the various different fund
portfolios that are sold in the global market.
This kind of systematic complexity gets even worse in the case of foreign exchange
margin trading.
Foreign exchange market is known for its high risk due to various factors such as the
global  financial  crisis,  continental  and  regional  economic  crises  in  Asia/Europe,
petroleum, grain and economic policy differences in each country, and etc., resulting in
only a very few asset management companies that are professional engaged in the
FOREX market despite high transaction volume by foreign exchange leverage (operated
by 100-fold, if actual capital is based at 1), and there are very limited professional exch-
10




-ange rate system applied in the FOREX market unlike the case for the stock trading.
Then, there arise a question, "despite of such various problems and factors, where are
the astronomical amount of 85 trillion dollars being traded at?"
It is made possible as the top 15 asset management companies in the world currently
operate  29.8  trillion  dollars,  equivalent  to  about                                               35%  of  the  entire  global  asset
management  market  volume.  If  scope  is  expanded  up  to  the  top                                 110                                   asset
management companies, it will be about 43.8 trillion dollars, equivalent to 51% of the
total global asset management market volume.

http://www.visualcapitalist.com/chart-trillion-dollar-club
Although giant corporations and giant capitals are the ones dealing with these big
asset management companies, there are also other average-scale investors and asset
management companies that can solve the problems by themselves. However as for
small  and  medium-sized  investors  and  asset  management  companies,  the  above
depicted systematic limitations are unresolvable, and the number of such corporates
gets even higher if the scope is narrowed down to single business / investment unit.
11
-




Most investors  (especially small and medium-sized investors) in many countries are
only subscribing to funds that are created in their own country or that are sold by asset
management   companies   operating   in   their   own   countries.   Thus,   the   asset
management  companies  too  are  only  focusing  on  the  local  investors  as  potential
investors.
What if these services  (as shown in Figure  2) provided only by the top-level asset
management  companies  would  be  readily  available  for  small  and  medium-sized
investors and as well as for general asset management companies?
The AIDUS Project Team has developed an appropriate alternative to these systematic
problems, and has taken a fundamental review in the perspective of both investors and
asset  management  companies  on  the  alternative  model  to  enable  its  immediate
application in the current asset management market.
2. AIDUS’ Core Tasks and Business Model
2.1. Core Tasks of the Project
[Figure 3] Need and Core Tasks of Investors and Asset Management Companies
If investors have an easy access to the fund information that they need and have some
sort of navigation in their own languages, and if they don’t need to do go through
stages of exchanges for foreign investments, and if it would be easy for them to reque-
12




-st for a redemption or a reinvestment at maturity or mid-term of fund management
period, there will be much freer environment to sign into various foreign fund portfolios.
Moreover, if it is easy for one to invest in each asset management company's products
once the personal information has been registered in the system, without the necessity
to register individual information to various asset management companies, and if the
personal information is safely stored without risk of being hacked or being exposed to
any unauthorized use, investors will be able to sign into any types of foreign fund items.
Of  course,  each  country  has  a  different  regulation  on  the  protection  of  personal
information,  so  this  area  will  be  dealt  with  appropriate  application  on  the  local
regulation and legal framework.
If an asset management company has to enlist only the fund information, plus if they
are  given  a  free  usage  of  the  online  platform  that  connects  them  and  their  fund
portfolios to the global investors, the company will be able to secure and attract as
many foreign investors as they wish.
If the fund portfolios are highly profitable and safe, investors will be more likely to sign
into the fund, while the asset management company will be able to further expand in
the securing of investors.
In order to satisfy the various demands and necessities as abovementioned, the three
fundamental core tasks by the AIDUS Project Team are as follow.
First is the establishment of a safe decentralized fund market system.
1) Establishing  of  a  direct  transaction  through  the  decentralized  fund  market
system based on the Blockchain technologies
2) Rapid and accurate transaction of fund signing and redemption through the
SMART Contract
3) Providing of credible and tamper-proof fund information
4) Establishing of security system that protects private information and asset
property of investors
5) Structuring of environment that can be conveniently accessed by both global
investors and asset management companies (Online / Mobile)
6) Providing of investor-oriented services with minimum service fees
13




To carry out the above six tasks, a totally new concept of a decentralized platform has
to be established through the Blockchain technologies.
Second is the adoption of a single currency using the cryptocurrency.
1) Necessity of the adoption of real cryptocurrency system enabling limitless
settlement in signing in and redemption of various foreign fund items
2) Necessity of a protective measure for coin holders (investors) by instilling a
fundamental to the cryptocurrency
3) Operation  of  a  single  currency  system  enabling  the  cryptocurrency  for
investment and asset management
4) Establishing of the ecosystem of various types of asset management and
securing of resources through the single currency system
To carry out the above four tasks, a single currency system using cryptocurrency has to
be established and the proprietary QTS has to be utilized to secure the needful
fundamentals for the cryptocurrency.
Third is the providing of a high-profit solution.
1) Asset management companies are in need of high profit solution
2) High profit solution must be equipped with high degree of safety
To carry out the above two tasks and as well as to any asset management companies in
the global market, it is critical to secure a high profit solution in order to design high
profit fund portfolios for their investors. Once the fund market established will be
equipped with various high profit fund products, it is a given fact that more investors
will join in the fund market.
The AIDUS Project Team now declares the innovative business model that can satisfy
all three core tasks as laid out in the above.
14




2.2. Business Model Established to Carry Out the Core Tasks
Going  back  to  the  initial  questions  where  the  AIDUS  started  the  project,  the  basic
question can be summarized as follow.
“How can we solve the problems associated to current ICOs and cryptocurrency?”
“How can we tackle the issues pertaining  to the current global asset management
market and to solve the current pain points for every participant in the market?”
With the above questions in mind, the AIDUS Project Team has structured a win-win
strategy for every participant in this project including the ICO participants, investors in
the asset management, asset management companies, and the AIDUS Project Team
ourselves. Through the blend of QTS which is based on the big-data that has been
gathered and compiled on 30-year long FX Trading records and the AIDUS Coin-based
Decentralized Fund Market (ADFP), the final business model has been established.
[ Figure 4 ] Structure of the AIDUS Business Model
The official name of the project based on the above business model is the ‘AIDUS Global
D-Fund Platform  (ADFP)’ Project, and the coin that is to be used in this platform is
named as the “AIDUS Coin(AID)”.

Ⅲ. AIDUS Business
1. AIDUS Business Definition
1.1. AIDUS Business Vision
The  business  vision  of  the  AIDUS  is  to  supply  various  fund  products to  the  global
market that are equipped with the highest yield rate available in the market by basing
the portfolios on the ADFP and the QTS, and to gradually take the lead role in the global
asset management market.
If the yield rate records are proven within the next 2 to 3 years as going beyond the
average yield rates of various global top hedge funds such as the Renaissance Fund,
Kensington  Fund,  or  the  Wellington  Fund,  as  well  as  if  the  capability of  the  asset
management gets recognized, the asset management volume utilizing the QTS from
the AIDUS will be expanded at a remarkable speed. Thus, it is our vision to expand the
QTS-applied asset volume to reach 10 trillion KRW within the next 5 years (2023) to
carry out the main leading role for the global asset management market.
Once the QTS-applied asset volume reaches 10 trillion KRW, the AISYS GLOBAL PTE.
LTD. (Headquarter) shall be a strong enterprise recording 600 billion KRW annual sales
figure.
[ Figure 5 ] AIDUS Business Vision
In the process toward the vision, the volume of global investors accessing the AIDUS
Fund Market, which is based on the ADFP, will naturally expand, gradually establishing a
16




newly innovative ecosystem in the global asset management market with the ADFP at
its very core, which would also gradually expand the usage volume of the AIDUS Coin.
The AIDUS Coin value and its market cap will ultimately be one of the world’s top three
cryptocurrency  right  next  to  the  current  benchmark  cryptocurrency,  Bitcoin  and
ETHEREUM, as the AIDUS shall be the basis for the global asset management market.
1.2. AIDUS Business Introduction
The AIDUS Business is composed of two different business models. The first business
is the QTS service business model for the FX Trading System. The second business
model is the AIDUS Coin.
[ Figure 6 ] AIDUS Business Definition
1) QTS Service Business refers to the servicing between the AISYS GLOBAL PTE. LTD.
(Headquarter) and asset management companies (hedge funds, finance companies and
etc.) that have settled into contractual agreement to be listed at the ADFP(Fund Market)
regarding creation and management of various high profit fund items. Fund portfolios
applying the QTS will be registered as official fund products on the ADFP along with
assistance support for investor attraction. The basic profit model on this business area
is to share the management fee and the performance fee (servicing fee) with hedge
funds and finance companies that have settled into QTS Servicing Agreement.
2) ADFP-based Fund Market service is to provide a decentralized fund market that
would enable global investors to freely access the online / mobile platform service to
17




sign into various fund portfolios and request its redemption through the usage of the
AIDUS Coin.
[ Figure 7 ] Operational Structure of AIDUS Global D-Fund Platform
ADFP-based  Fund  Market  service  will  not  only  carry  out  various  profit  model  as  a
professional asset management community website itself but it will also carry out the
new central role in the ecosystem of the asset management market and shall further
expand into consortium and cooperation with various other derivatives.
This  business  model  will  be  further  expanded  into  ADFP  and  AIDUS  Coin-based
payment business, management and distribution business on digitized asset property.
18




2. Blockchain Technologies behind AIDUS Business
As  the  big  waves  of  the  Fourth  Industrial  Revolution  are  pushed  into  the  financial
industry, paradigms are changing due to major infrastructure technologies such as
artificial intelligence, Blockchain technology, biometrics authentication technology, and
the Internet of Things.
Especially, the Blockchain technology is evolving noticeably through the simplicity and
diversification of "non-face-to-face financial transactions" of the asset management
market  and  of  payment  methods.  It  is  particularly  expanding  into  various  areas  of
authentication, payment and remittance.
Various fin-tech start-ups, ICT firms are using the current Blockchain technologies to
be  more  responsive  to  the  demands  and  to  provide  faster  and  more  convenient
financial services, while traditional financial services segments are being dismantled.
This is because the financial platform based on the fourth industry has been developed
instead of the existing financial services area, which has been carried out with a lot of
manpower and capital, so that consumers no longer need to visit financial institutions
and all financial transactions are possible through the platform.
[ Figure 9 ] Anticipated effects of Blockchain introduction - Korea Institute of Finance
The adoption of Blockchain technologies in the ADFP-based AIDUS fund market is also
expected to bring various effects to every participant.                                           19




2.1. Adoption of a Single Key Currency
The ‘AIDUS Coin(AID)’ is being used as the single key currency in the ADFP-based AIDUS
fund market, enabling fund signing and redemption request only through the AIDUS
Coin. This would represent that the AIDUS Coin shall actually be a ‘real currency’ that
users can use in the real economy of asset management market.
Investors  can  buy  the  AIDUS  Coin  at  crypto  exchanges,  while  asset  management
companies  can liquidate the coin in cash either  at  the crypto exchanges  or  at the
LP(liquidity provider) to manage their own fund portfolios. When the fund expires or
has been requested for resales, asset management companies can purchase the coin
from the exchange market and give it to the investors
This structure can solve the following problems.
First, through the usage of the AIDUS Coin as the single key currency to sign into
the fund items, convenient investment is being facilitated at a global level. In other
words, there is no need of exchange or foreign transfers.
Second, there is no or at least minimum exchange fee because there is no need for
money exchange.
Third, it is easy to reinvest as fund signing and redemptions are made in AIDUS Coin.
Fourth, once a fund has been subscribed, in spite of the decline in the value of the
cryptocurrency at mid-termination and expiration, the current market price will not
be applied in the investor’s value.
If the value of the cryptocurrency rises, it is up to the investor to decide whether to
choose the rising value of the cryptocurrency or the yield rate of the fund. Since it is
possible to repurchase after paying fixed commission as it is the case for most of fund
portfolios,  investor  is  also  responsible  for  selecting  a  rise  in  the  value  of  the
cryptocurrency after redemption of the fund.
This is the key to creating a single currency system by means of AIDUS Coin.
The AIDUS Project Team has prepared various resources and policies pertaining to the
20




liquidation and payment of the AIDUS Coin at the fund expiration that are needed for
its full usage at the fund market. However, as these details are unique business models
that are proprietary to the AIDUS, these details have been decided not to be disclosed
at this Whitepaper. The information, however, shall be made available to the public in a
sequential manner following the opening of the AIDUS fund market.
Moreover, once these features and policies are fully implemented, investors shall be
able to witness with their own eyes a new innovative model that will enable increase in
both coin value and fund yield rate.
2.2. Blockchain-based Decentralized Fund Market
The  ‘AIDUS fund market’ based on the ADFP is scheduled to be opened at the  1st
quarter of 2019, aiming at the establishment of P2P market through the core essence
feature of decentralization by the Blockchain technologies.
Thus, in our fund market, the asset management companies shall be the one to provide
fund information, and to promote their own unique fund products, while the investors
shall confirm the information and shall sign into the fund portfolios at their own desire.
The  AIDUS  shall  never  interfere  at  any  part of  this  transaction  made  between  the
investors and the asset management companies.
The very reason is because due to the nature of fund portfolios, only duly licensed
asset management companies are able to create fund products and to sell their own
fund products. In this regard, every country implements different regulatory framework
on the fund operation and it would be highly inefficient for the AIDUS to operate and
manage countless numbers of asset management companies and its fund portfolios.
The  AIDUS  shall  be  operating  the  service  with  the  adherence  to  the  current  legal
framework,  while  it  shall  also  advance  in  the  innovative  technologies  and  business
models for ever-growing future market. In fact, in terms of legal framework, there are
only  two  entities  in  the  fund  operation,  the  investor  and  the  asset  management
companies. Thus, in this regard, there is absolutely no need to bring in 3rd party in the
agreement, and the system will always be P2P-oriented service.
The focus is rather given to provide more reliable fund information, and to strengthen
21




various R&D activities with an aim to promote reliable asset management companies
regardless of the management capital volume, and to implement regular monitoring
system to spot unsuitable fund portfolios or asset management companies, turning the
platform   into   a   much   more   investor-oriented   system   and   making   itself   the
‘professional global community on asset management’.
Going further, as per the description at [ Figure 9 ] on various expected effects through
the  Blockchain,  the  application  of  various  features  such  as  SMART  Contract,
Blockchain-based authentication, tamper-proof, and ever-strong security protocols will
be just a few examples for the truly innovative asset management service to come.

The AIDUS Business is a business model that has been equipped with the following
main 4 differentiation strategies from any other projects.
22




1) Single Key Currency with Fundamentals and Real Currency
When going through other ICO records, it is often case that they are seriously lacking
protective measures for the investors. This is the reason why some of the ICO entities
are now presenting various experimental methodologies for the investor protection.
It is also the case for the AIDUS Project Team, as depicted in the introduction of this
Whitepaper, there has been quite an effort on the designing of a stable coin.
One main strategy that has been implemented in our model is to prevent our coin to be
literally zero in value by instilling certain amount of fundamentals to our coin which was
made possible as we have the QTS as our proprietary asset.
The AIDUS Project Team shall be operating 50% of the ICO-raised capital through the
QTS  to  secure  100%  level  of  the  ICO-raised  capital  within  3  years  to  provide  the
fundamentals to the coin, while the specific management details shall be transparently
shared to the public.
By doing so, the AIDUS Project Team has created a truly real currency coin model that
can actually be used in the real economy along with the fundamentals instilled in the
coin, which was not possible even for both Bitcoin, the 1st generation cryptocurrency,
and ETHEREUM, the 2nd generation cryptocurrency.
2) High-Profit Solution through SMART QTS
The AIDUS Project Team is aiming at the creation of the world’s largest professional
asset management community through the decentralized fund market operation based
on the ADFP.
In order to accomplish the goal, it is critical to attract various investors to our fund
market which can only be possible by securing various competitive fund products on
our platform. To do so, our proprietary QTS shall be the most powerful solution.
As  more  trust  on  our  QTS  is  established,  the  more  global  asset  management
companies shall be in partnership with us to create various high-profit fund products
on our decentralized fund market to be supplied to global investors.
23




3) Establishment of Investor-oriented Market through Decentralized Fund Market
The  AIDUS  Coin-based  decentralized  fund  market  shall  be  the  most  efficient  and
investor-oriented fund market for the global investors wishing for asset management
service.  The  entire  process  is  applied  with  the  SMART  Contract,  enabling  efficient
processing from the attracting of investors by the asset management companies to
the  expiring  of  fund  operation  period.  The  Blockchain  technologies  will  create
convenient processing for asset management companies while investors can freely
browse through global fund portfolios.
4) Establishment of Digitized Asset Management Ecosystem
Asset management market keeps on changing through various types of collaboration
among the players in the market, along with various new technologies being applied in
the market.
The  AIDUS  Project  Team  is  aiming  for  the  establishing  of  ecosystem  devoted  for
“digitized asset management” and to take the leading role in this ecosystem. To do so,
we have implemented a strategy of allocating specialized budget for this ecosystem
activation and on the usage of the QTS in this market, to be the firm supporter for the
activation of the digitized asset management ecosystem.
3.2. Focus Target Group for AIDUS Coin
‘Who shall be the users of the AIDUS Coin? And how many would they be?’
The focus target group for the AIDUS Coin using the ADFP can be defined as every
individual or an institution that is wishing to proliferate their own asset volume.
◆ Gaming Industry
- Target User: Gamers
- Market Volume: USD 108 Billion
24




◆ Music Industry
- Target User: Users of various music contents
- Market Volume: USD 17.38 Billion
◆ AIDUS Target Market (Asset Management Market)
- Target User: Individual or institution interested in asset proliferation
- Market Volume: USD 85 Trillion
[ Figure 11 ] Comparison of Global Major Market Volume
As  abovementioned,  the  focus  target  group  for  the  AIDUS  Business  is  anyone
interested in the asset management.
If  to  be  more  specific,  the  target  group  could  be  categorized  into  individual  and
institution  as  per  the  table  at  [  Figure  12  ] on  the  Focus  Target  Group  for AIDUS
Business.
As such, potential buyers in the AIDUS Business is way far beyond the entire market
volume  of  the  cryptocurrency  and  shall  basically  be  anyone  active  in  the  global
economy.
25




[ Figure 12 ] Focus Target Group for AIDUS Business
The future growth potential of the AIDUS Coin starts from the targeting the global
asset management market as its focus group.
26




Ⅳ. AIDUS Coin
1. AIDUS Coin Summary
The AIDUS Coin is used as the single key currency for the ADFP-based decentralized fund
market.
The word AIDUS stands for the  ‘AI(artificial intelligence)  + Sidus(star-in Latin)’, symbolizing
the best of the global asset management market.
The symbol of the AIDUS Coin is ‘AID’ and is a token based on ERC20.
Investors and asset management companies shall be using the AIDUS Coin during the signing
into the funds, expiration of the fund operation period, and redemption at the ADFP-based
decentralized fund market.
[ Figure 13 ] Usage Structure of AIDUS Coin
Investors wishing to engage in the asset management can buy the AIDUS Coin from a crypto
exchange  and  can  sign  into  the  asset  management  company's  fund  through  the  AIDUS
platform. Asset management companies publish various information on the AIDUS platform
so that the investors could select the fund, and when the investor selects the fund, SMART
Contract will be the basis for the settlement.
Then, after operating the fund the asset management company shall purchase the AIDUS
coin again at the exchange, according to the fund operation profit to be paid to the investor.
27




During this transaction, when signing into the fund of the asset management company,
the amount proposed by the asset management company is converted into the market
price of coin during then, which the investor shall buy at the exchange to sign into the
fund. The asset management company also pays coins after converting funds into the
current price of coin according to profit after the fund management.
In the above manner, the AIDUS Coin is used for signing into various global fund items
created  by  global  asset  management  companies  and  as  well  as  facilitating  easy
redemption to the existing fund portfolio.
AIDUS Coin does not try to represent itself as  3rd generation cryptocurrency and it
does not try to develop difficult Blockchain technologies as it is the case for many other
ICO projects. Rather, the AIDUS is focusing on the strengthening of various features
related  to  the  Blockchain  technologies  such  as  the  coin  itself,  platform,  security,
stability, and SMART Contract for safe transaction.
AIDUS is aiming at truly creating a  ‘valuable coin’ through business models, and has
now developed the said business model that will enable the current value of the coin,
not just restricted to the future listing value like other coin, and to enable an actual
immediate usage at our platform.
The AIDUS Coin’s main features can be summarized as following.
(1) Core Features of AIDUS Coin
1) Real Currency
As  investors  can  actually  use  the  coin  at  fund  market  during  signing  and
redemption of fund items, AIDUS Coin can be immediately used in real economy.
2) Coin having fundamentals
50% of the ICO-raised capital shall be managed by QTS, securing 100% of the
ICO-raised capital within 3 years as the fundamental to the coin, making the coin
safe as it shall never plummet below a certain degree.
3) Continuous value increase potential
As the fund volume at the platform expands, and as more people will sign into
the fund items, the more demand it will be for the AIDUS Coin.
28




2. AIDUS Coin aimed at Maximizing Profit
If you look at the AIDUS Coin closely, you will see an interesting phenomenon in it.
First, if you sign into a fund with the AIDUS Coin, the real money’s yield rate will be
changed according to fund management.
Second, if you have the AIDUS coin, the coin's yield rate will fluctuate as the coin's value
fluctuates.
When you have already signed into a fund, you will not be affected by the rise / fall of
AIDUS coin price, but you will be affected by yield rate of the fund that is operated in
the real economy. If you did not sign into a fund but just have a coin, you will be
affected by the rise / fall of coin but not related to the real economy.
[ Figure 14 ] Maximizing of AIDUS’ Coin Yield Rate
What if you estimate that the coin price will fall? You can sign into a fund and reflect
the fund's earnings, which is by the real economy.
What if the coin price rises? When you compare the fund’s yield rate with that of the
coin’s, if the fund yield rate is better, it will be better to operate by the fund, otherwise
it would be better to terminate the fund and reflect earnings on the coin’s market price.
29




Of course, when you terminate a fund at the mid-term, you will have to pay a certain
fee to the asset management company, but this is unavoidable because it is the same
in the real economy, and choice is yours to decide.
Especially, nowadays, different kind of regulations and guidelines for each country are
presented on crypto market, and as a result there is a high volatility and fluctuation in
the crypto market. However, AIDUS Coin is not influenced by the national ICO policy
because  if  the  coin  falls  due  to  the  policy  as  mentioned  above,  the  effect  can  be
minimized by signing into a fund with a good yield rate as an alternative.
Moreover, as described at ‘Ⅲ. AIDUS Business’, ‘2.1. Adoption of a Single Key Currency’
that revenue generation from both the rise of AIDUS Coin value and the yield rate of a
fund portfolio, the users of the AIDUS Coin shall have a hands-on experience on the
innovative value of the AIDUS Coin.
As such, the AIDUS Coin is using an innovative concept of coin as the investor could
choose either the coin market price or fund yield rate. Is there any other coin in the
market that can maximize the profit in this manner?
“Currency that can be used as a cash but can also choose between fund yield rate or
coin profit or expect a rise from both areas.”
This is what the AIDUS has been pursuing long after, the cryptocurrency that can instill
a profit maximizing strategy in it.
30




Ⅴ. QUANT TRADING SYSTEM(QTS)
Before describing the platform, we would like to describe another business model.
There  is  a  keyword  at  ‘II.2.1.  The  NEED  and  Core  tasks  of  investors  and  asset
management companies’ as ‘Third is the providing of a high-profit solution.’ This means
that even the platform is targeted worldwide, if it cannot build the high profit programs
that  investors  want,  they  will  not  use  our  platform  but  use  their  more  profitable
domestic funds.
Therefore, we intend to link high profit programs that can generate strong returns on
fund management to asset management companies who use our platform, to maximize
the synergy effect
1. What is Quant Trading System?
The Quant Trading System (hereinafter referred to as "QTS") has undergone 15 years
of research and development and has been commercialized three years ago. QTS is a
system operated through collecting and analyzing big data for the past 30 years.
1.1. Why is QTS optimized at FOREX(Foreign exchange) market?
1) Interactive transaction
FOREX trading is a market that is traded in both directions of sell and buy. It is a
structure in which profit is generated not only in an upside (buy) condition such as the
stock market but also in the case of a downside (sell) condition.
2) Daily trading volume
$ 5.3 trillion is traded every day, as it is the single biggest trading market in the world
based on daily trading volume among financial asset trading markets.   There is not
much influence from speculative or manipulative trading or operation of certain forces
31




as it is the case in the stock market.
3) Stability
The exchange rate of currency, which is the basic element of FOREX, is determined by
trade volume and national policy, so it can maintain relatively stable flow.
4) Diversity of operation
It is possible to use various strategies by changing PIP interval setting and algorithm.
1.2. QTS Structure
[ Figure 15 ] Quant Trading System Structure
1) Gathering Server
It is a server that stores Big Data for about 30 years and collects new data.
2) Quant Server
It  communicates  with  Gathering  Server  and  Client  Trading  System,  analyzes  data
collected from current transactions and Gathering Server, and provides information to
enable Client System Trading program to sell and trade correctly.
3) Client System Trading.
Based on the information of Quant Server, it conducts FOREX trading through Client's
Fund account. In conclusion, QTS conducts the optimal transaction and generates the
most stable profit by using the AIDUS algorithm and the data collected through the role
of  each  server,  and  it  generates  the  most  stable  profit  by  conducting  the  optimal
transaction.
32




1.3. QTS Trading Technique
(1) QTS based on FOREX Big Data
①  Do not see the chart.
②  If the sample is constant, the statistics do not change.
③  It is based on a thorough analysis without any prediction.
(2) The core of QTS trading technique
①  Analysis through Big Data
The best deal point is selected by a series of graphing and data block arrays
through the collection and analysis of FOREX Big Data for about 30 years, by
real time analysis, and also by means of detailed analysis of the point of time of
the transaction and leveling by each analysis point.
①  The law of algebra based on Quant analysis
AIDUS's Quant Trading System applies the law of algebra, which is based on
Quant analysis, to carry out the transaction in the most ideal way.
* *Law of algebra.
If we analyze the data of a whole group which is infinite population or its size is too
large to be technically surveyed; or when the scale is so large that it is not technically
possible to conduct a full investigation, it points to observe the case of algebra in order
to grasp the intrinsic nature of the group and make the data the basis of the subject of
the investigation.
33




2. QTS Performance
2.1. QTS Management Performance Overview
QTS has gone through various pilot testing until 2015 along with regular revision and
updates to be the current solution. Since 2016, there has been public evaluation on the
system  through  collaboration  with  asset  management  professionals  for public  pilot
fund management. Below chart is the record for the past 3 years of operation.
[ Figure 16 ] Management Record from 2015 June to 2018 September
On the account of Iron FX, ID 3868724
Ted Min, COO of AISYS Global, has a total yield rate of 230.7% (average annual return of
about 70.9%) for thirty nine months.
2.2. Performance Record of Pilot Fund and Virtual Account using QTS
※ SUMMARY.
(1) Target: 11 accounts total including 3 accounts of Pilot Fund and 8 virtual accounts.
(2) Operating Period: From minimum 2 months up to 39months
(3) Average annual yield rate: 98.95%
34




In this way, QTS can strategically use aggressive fund management and stable fund
management through PIP setting and algorithm alteration.
The above records have been an opportunity to accumulate the needful expertise and
experience to design fund portfolios and its know-hows and as well as to strengthen
the stability of the system, which is the single biggest factor in the conventional fund
operation market.
Moreover, the operating principle is to transparently publicize all the transaction
datasheet through an outside notarization agency.
[ Figure 17-1 ] Performance Record of Pilot fund and Virtual Account for 3 years
(4) Main figures in the Pilot Management
① David Chen - CEO of AISYS Global, AngelVest Group Co-founder & Leader
•   AngelVest Group - Largest investment group in Shanghai, China (http://angelvestgroup.com)
*  Co-founded  the  Hanson  Robotics  which  has  developed  Sophia,  an  artificial
intelligence robot
② Ted Min - COO of AISYS Global, QTS developer and designer based on Quant analysis
※ The annual yield rate was calculated on the basis of the situation where the real
operating account is operated for one year.
35




※ The virtual account and the market for the transaction use the same data of the
actual  trading  market,  so  the  transaction  result  is  not  different  from  the  actual
operating account.
※ The virtual accounts and real transaction accounts were traded through LAND FX
and Iron FX's MT4 Application.
※ In this chart, we can see that all accounts in the AIDUS's Quant Trading System have
been started differently and have different trading periods. This proves that stable
earnings are generated in all various situations that occurred, not only in certain time
periods or in specific circumstances.
(5) Qualification of notary public for QTS asset management profit rate
QTS Asset Management Performance will be notified by accounting firm and law firm
and announced through AIDUS ICO homepage every week.
[Figure 17-2] Notarization letter of Law firm,   “Jimyeong"
36




[Figure 17-3] Notarization letter of accounting firm, “Gongjung"
2.3. Verification on Stability of QTS
The stability of QTS has been proved through this practical operation for three years. If
the volatility of the fluctuations in the FOREX trading is very large, most of them will
see a margin call or a big loss, but QTS has a stable profit even in the case of rapid
fluctuation of trading.
(1) Brexit - June 24. 2016
On June 24thm 2016 during the Brexit by UK, QTS secured a stable profit of 29.6%
even in the event of a plunge of about 2,700 PIP
[ Figure 18 ] FOREX Volatility Chart during Brexit Declaration
37




(2) U.K Pound Plunges - Oct. 7. 2016
On October  7th  2016, the Pound of U.K was plummeted to  1,400  PIP, but the QTS
gained 9.2%.
[ Figure 19 ] FOREX Volatility Chart during Hard-Brexit Declaration
(3) USA Presidential Election - November 2016
At the time of the US presidential election, there was a wave of 1,500 PIPs, but QTS
earned 8.5%.
[ Figure 20 ] FOREX Volatility Chart during Release of US Presidential Election Result
As such, QTS is a trading system that maximizes profits while minimizing risk in various
environment and even in extreme environment.
2.4. Yield Rate Comparison with Global AMCs
AIDUS's Quant Trading System has a comparative advantage in comparison with the
world's leading asset management companies in the yield rate comparison.
Renaissance  Fund,  a  world  renowned  hedge  fund  is  recording  annual  yield  rate  of
15.6% to 16.5%, ranking the top reputation in hedge funds, while Kensington Fund and
Wellington Fund are ranking similar yield rate of 14.3% during 2015.
38




[ Figure 21 ] World’s Renowned AMCs Yield Rate Status
As for Mr. David Chen and Mr. Ted Min, the core executive of the AIDUS Project, have
recorded  92.5% and  70.9% yield rate respectively  (annual IRR basis) during the pilot
fund operation for over the past 39 months, which are seriously remarkable figures.
Pilot Fund Operation Performance - Based on May 2018 Data
However, it might be somewhat difficult to quickly jump into the conclusion favorable to
the QTS just by looking at the above simple comparative chart.
As what is important is the strategy for the designing of a suitable fund item.
39




2.5. Fund Portfolio Strategy utilizing QTS
The AIDUS Project Team shall be applying an algorithm that has been further improved
in  its  stability  when  compared  to  the  algorithm  used  during  the  QTS  pilot  fund
operation.
[ Figure 23 ] QTS-applied Fund Portfolios Target Yield Rate
In other words, the QTS-applied fund portfolios will be intentionally lowered to 15% to
30%   annual  yield  rate  in  order  to  strengthen  its  stability  to  equip  enough
competitiveness in the conventional fund market.
In this regard, we shall be using the following two strategies to enhance the stability.
(1) Applying Stability-enhanced QTS Algorithm
The algorithm used for the pilot fund and virtual account operation during the past 3
years has also been focused for the testing of its stability. Thus, the records were
achieved  with  an  effort  to  test  the  achievement  and  performance  in  various  risk
situation and through usage of various pattern-based algorithm of the QTS.
However, in order to penetrate the conventional fund market, we shall be applying 2 to
3 times more enhanced algorithm in terms of its stability, along with our strategy to
design a fund portfolio with higher portion allocated for the QTS application.
40




(2) Collaboration Strategy with various AMCs’ portfolios
Asset management companies can utilize the QTS to design various structure of fund
items depending on the fund characteristics, competitiveness, and target yield rate.
[ Figure 24 ] Sample Fund Portfolio Structure using High stability QTS
As depicted in the above figure, the QTS will enable the asset management companies
to create a unique fund portfolio reflecting the needs of the investors.
41




3. QTS Operation and Profit Model
QTS is based on the structure that the asset management company should first be in a
contractual relationship on the AIDUS platform to, then, have a separate agreement
and contract with the AISYS GLOBAL PTE. LTD..
[ Figure 25 ] QTS Contract Flow
In other words, it is necessary to enter into the AIDUS platform to use the QTS. The
asset management company may not use the QTS if the company doesn’t want, or the
asset management company can generate a fund linked to QTS such as bond or stock.
However,  when  the  contract  is  made,  the  accurate  investment  amount  should  be
confirmed and then operated.
QTS usage fee is as follows.
1) Management Fee - 2% of initial investment amount
2) Performance Fee - 20%-30% of investment profit
The above fees are slightly lower than the average management commission fees of
other asset management companies, and may be adjusted depending on the situation.
In addition, since QTS operation is operated by AISYS GLOBAL PTE. LTD. regardless of
ICO, fees and usage rights are subject to the policy of AISYS GLOBAL PTE. LTD..
42




Ⅵ. AIDUS Global D-Fund Platform
The official name for the platform is the ‘AIDUS Global D-Fund Platform’, or referred to
as ‘ADFP’ as its abbreviation.
The reason behind the creation of ADFP is mentioned in  [II.2.1. The NEED and Core
tasks of investors and asset management companies], as we are aiming at creating a
world’s  biggest  professional  asset  management  community  and  platform  in  which
global investors can freely join to access to global asset management market.
[ Figure 26 ] Connecting to Global Asset Management Market through ADFP
ADFP can only be used through the AIDUS Coin, allowing the users to be connected to
the world market without any exchange service.
Investors can get access to any fund in any country through fund information from
around  the  world,  and  asset  management  companies  can  promote  and  attract
investors also from all around the world.
43




[ Figure 27 ] Operational Structure of ADFP-based Decentralized Fund Market
Investors who have joined ADFP can automatically create wallets within the
platform, operate AIDUS’s functions like HTS, and use MY Page to get the coin
quantity / fund information favorites / yield status / personal information in real
time.
The  asset  management  company  can  easily  manage  the  fund  product
promotion  and  opening,  subscription  status,  real-time  yield  rate  and
redemption  by  using  the  decentralized  fund  market,  and  satisfy  the
requirement to use the QTS that has been developed by the AISYS GLOBAL PTE.
LTD..
In addition, as all of the process laid out above are identical with that of the
process taking place in the real economy, and that there is not a single room
that might cause a legal issue, as investors and asset management companies
are applied with their own local regulation. In fact, it is because the asset
management company is the one which has created and operated the fund in
accordance with the local financial laws of the applicable country and that it is
the one that has attracted the investors.
44




1. ADFP-based Decentralized Fund Market Structure
There are various service features at the ADFP, but we shall first focus on
the explanation of the decentralized fund market model as it constitutes
the core feature of the ADFP.
1.1 Basic Structure of ADFP-based Decentralized Fund Market
Main  participants  of  ADFP-based  decentralized  fund  market  are  investors,  asset
management companies, and the ADFP used by them.
[ Figure 28 ] Basic Structure of ADFP-based Decentralized Fund Market
The ADFP platform allows investors to become members and sign contracts with the
asset management company to use the ADFP platform. Here, ADFP simply provides the
platform  and  does  not  engage  in  any  contracts  between  investors  and  asset
management companies at all. In other words, ADFP is the same as an open market or
a  direct  deal  market,  where  all  funds  are  traded  only  by  the  investors  and  asset
management companies.
45




1.1.1. Fund Usage Structure by Investors
The investor purchases AIDUS after signing up in the platform, transfers the coin to the
member’s wallet within the platform, confirms the fund information, and identifies the
fund which he would like to join in ADFP. When an investor signs up for a desired fund,
he needs to invest the corresponding AIDUS since the amount of the fund is based on
the real currency. After signing up, the asset management company will manage the
fund and the investor will receive his yield in the AIDUS Coin to be paid into the ADFP
wallet, matching the real currency value, during the fund maturity or mid-term closing.
[ Figure 29 ] Fund Usage Structure by Investors
At this time, the investor has a chance to choose how to get the yield return either in
cash or in AIDUS, depending on the asset management company, when he signs up for
the fund.
If you want to cash out when you hold the AIDUS, you can transfer it to your personal
wallet and convert it to cash on a regular market exchange. If you want to reinvest
money, you should check the information of funds and sign into a fund through AIDUS
in the ADFP wallet.
Since the investor's assets are being converted into cash and being managed as funds
by the asset management company during the <fund signing in>, <fund management>,
<maturity  /  mid-term  closing>  as  depicted  in  [Figure  28  Fund  Usage  Structure  by
Investors],  they  are  affected  not  by  the  market  price  of  AIDUS  Coin,  but  by  real
currency economy. In other cases, the market price of AIDUS Coin will be applied in the
46




pricing. As it was explained in [IV. 1. AIDUS Coin Summary], one of the core elements of
the AIDUS Coin is the profit maximization strategy that was instilled in the coin itself.
Thus,  every  investor  must  carefully  contemplate  on  this  are  before  making  fixed
investment decisions.
The investor wallet within the ADFP is privately owned, and even though the AIDUS
Coin is in the wallet, it is not yet cashed or funded, so it is affected by the market price
of AIDUS Coin. Therefore, the investor can regard the wallets in the ADFP as his/her
own wallet, and that it can be easily understood by approaching the concept of linking
his/her bank account with a private account in HTS for Stock Trading.
1.1.2. Fund Usage Structure by AMCs
[ Figure 30 ] ADFP Fund Usage Structure by AMCs
After signing the contract with the ADFP, the asset management company can create a
fund through the AMC’s Admin Page, and publicize the relevant information through
the  fund  information  page.  When  investors  sign  into  the  fund,  asset  management
company  cashes  the  AIDUS  sent  by  the  investor  into  the  company’s  wallet  and
manages the funds through SMART Contract.
In the event of a fund's maturity or mid-term closing request, the asset management
company will purchase the AIDUS corresponding to the yield return from the exchanges
as per the value of real currency and that will be paid to the investor. In this case, the
date and method of payment shall be notified to the investor prior to the fund's entry
and paid on the correct schedule, and the AIDUS payment or cash payment shall also be
agreed upon by the contract when investors sign into the fund in the first place.
47




In addition, just as in the real economy, every asset management company designates
a trustee to protect investors’ investments, and by doing so, the actual investment
funds must be managed by the trustees. This will be explained separately in the terms
of the contract.
If investors invest in large quantities or ask for a large amount of redemption, which
might trigger the AIDUS’ market price to fall  / rise, in which the asset management
companies can be affected by the market price. In order to prepare for this, we must
secure  liquidity  supply  through  contract  with  a  LP(liquidity  provider).  If  the  asset
management company can supply liquidity on its own, LP may not be needed, so the
asset management company can choose to use LP for its service.
1.2 Structure of Registration / Contract Signing in Fund Market
ADFP does not guarantee anonymity in the business model structure. This means that
the investor must certify himself / herself at the time of signing the fund, and the asset
management company must have a certificate issued by its own government in order
to ensure trust.
Therefore,  in  ADFP,  the  investor  must  fill  in  the  matters  related  to  KYC              (self-
certification) and AML (anti-money laundering) when signing up. This is a system that
all participants of AIDUS must go through, and especially for investors, because as it is
an  international  fund  transaction,  it  is  necessary  to  register  an  internationally
recognized passport identification.
Asset management companies can use ADFP only through a contract with ADFP, not
just a membership. The reason is for the "investor protection". In many countries, there
are tight regulation regarding the number of permits, such as an asset management
license, a fund management license, a joint venture certification, a vendor certificate,
asset reserves, and payment reserves for the same purpose.
ADFP has a duty to notarize and verify all of these in order to make a contract with an
asset management company for the protection of investors through a legal company in
each different country. Therefore, ADFP can be used only by reliable asset management
48




company through the ADFP membership and contract policy. In addition, the asset
management company limits the fund recruitment amount when the fund is created by
asset holdings and reserve funds.
For clarification, this is not about creating every new concept but to only enable real
asset management companies that have already received the proper license in the real
economy to join in the fund market. Of course, these companies do not necessarily
have to get every permit from every country, but if there is a specific regulation that
prohibits investment from a certain country and that if an asset management company
in the ADFP does not satisfy the specific condition, in this case, there will be a function
that prevents the settlement of agreement within the fund market.
In addition, under the ADFP contract, the asset management company should translate
the  company  introduction  and  fund  information  into  English,  Chinese,  Japanese,
German,  Russian,  Korean  and  Spanish,  and  inform  the  investors  of  the  fund
information when signing into the fund. This is the basic service that has to be provided

2.1. Features and System of ADFP-based Decentralized Fund Market
The  features  and  the  systematic  structure  of  the  ADFP-based  decentralized  fund
market is as depicted in the blow diagram.
The system is based on the ETHEREUM Network consisting of SMART Contract, Co-
authentication  feature,  fund  information  system, wallet  system  and various  related
features for the platform.
[ Figure 32 ] ADFP-based Decentralized Fund Market System Structure
2.1.1. SMART Contract
ADFP's system is a structure that caters signing into and reselling of funds online, so it
is important to sign contracts with investors and asset management companies using
SMART Contract. Therefore, AIDUS Coin must be transferred from the investor's wallet
to the asset management company's wallet automatically when the specific contract
has been settled. Also, in the case of the fund operation period maturity / mid-term
fund withdrawal, AIDUS Coin will be transferred from the asset management company’s
wallet to the investor’s wallet. In addition, each specific process will be automatically
reflected  with  the  application  and  contract  writing  and  customer  authentication
information, in a manner that the relevant information shall be automatically updated.
Most of these functions are based on the already existing technologies, but the
50




Blockchain technologies will be applied specifically to investor information and contract
information that require security enhancement.
2.1.1.1. Investor Registration Contract
Investors can register on the fund market by using AIDUS Dapp or through the website
provided by ADFP.  AIDUS  creates  an ETHEREUM user  account  through  METAMASK
Wallet (Chrome Extension) or through the MyEtherWallet, then encrypts and stores the
investor’s   personal   information,   specific   Nonce                                     (uint256)   information   and   the
ETHEREUM user account in the IPFS(Interplanetary File System) network, and receives
Hash                                                                                        (Contents  Address)  information  for  accessing  the  corresponding  personal
information from the IPFS. Therefore, personal information can only be accessed by the
user, and the decryption key that can be decrypted is also stored in the IPFS and given
a separate hash (Contents Address). In other words, only the user can access personal
information through IPFS and decrypt the personal information. AIDUS then registers
only the IPFS hash information in the ETHEREUM Blockchain that can access private
information using SMART Contract.
[ Figure 33 ] Investor Registration Contract Structure
51




2.1.1.2. AMC Registration Contract
The membership registration process of the asset management company consists of
two stages. The first stage includes the data storage process of asset management
company’s personal information, which is similar to the one which is used with general
investors.
The second stage includes the data storage process of the reference information of
the asset management company that should be accessible to the investors, which is
publicly stored in the IPFS by serializing it as Json File. Therefore, the Hash information
corresponding to the information of the asset management company of the second
step stored in the IPFS and the Hash information of the decryption key are registered
in the Blockchain through the SMART Contract of the AIDUS token at the same time as
the signing up.
[ Figure 34 ] AMC Registration Contract Structure
52




2.1.1.3. Fund Registration Contract
When registering a new fund information, SMART Contract based on the ETHEREUM
user account of the asset management company is being used to create a new SMART
Contract (CA, Contract Account) and register it in the ETHEREUM network.
At this time, the fund name, the fund type, the evaluation grade, the base price, the
scale of the fund, the total commission, the management company, the information of
fund   managers,   various   reports                                                      (investment   manual,   investment   protocol,
management report, asset management report, and etc.), fund redemption method,
fees, and etc. are registered in the ETHEREUM network, and the owner of the SMART
Contract Address of the fund becomes the asset management company who created
the fund.
At this time, EVM (ETHEREUM Virtual Machine) Storage is a structure for mapping key /
value, and since both key and value use 256-bit size, various report files are uploaded
to IPFS and only Hash information is registered in the ETHEREUM network.
[ Figure 35 ] Fund Registration Contract Structure
53




2.1.1.4. Fund Purchasing Contract
Investors  may  purchase  the  funds  registered  by  the  asset  management  company
through  SMART  Contract.  At  this  time,  the  investors  must  hold  the  AIDUS  Coin  in
his/her wallet and by sending the Coin to the SMART Contract Address of the relevant
fund the fund is officially purchased and settled. AIDUS Coin requires GAS (ETH) to be
sent and the exhaustion of sufficient GAS can lead to quick transactions.
When the fund is purchased, the asset management company acquires the authority to
view the investor's personal information. At this time, the asset management company
can  inquire the fund buyer's IPFS hash  information and hash information including
decryption key which would enable the viewing of information through SMART Contract.
[ Figure 36 ] Fund Purchasing Contract Structure
54




2.1.1.5 Fund Maturity / Redemption Contract
SMART contracts for fund maturity  / redemption are calculated by reference to the
information in the Oracles Information system during the maturity / redemption of the
fund. In other words, it is a SMART Contract that determines the amount to be paid to
the investor by the asset management company. However, the method of calculating
the fund redemption fee differs for each fund, and the investor's evaluation amount is
paid after the fund redemption fee is deducted. (Difference might occur according to
the type of fund, commission, redemption, and standard time)
At this point, the Oracles Information system continuously registers the fund base date,
reference price and yield rate at the base time, comparison index, type average, and
change rate in the ETHEREUM network through SMART Contract.
[ Figure 37 ] Fund Maturity / Redemption Contract Structure
55




2.1.2. Co-Authentication System
In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee, a software engineer of European Particle Research Institute
(CERN) located between Switzerland and France, researched the Web for quick and
accurate  information  exchange  among  researchers  working  in  universities  and
research institutes around the world. When the World Wide Web had been created, the
original goal of the Web was decentralization. But today's Web is rapidly centralized as
hundreds of millions of people rely on a handful of services.
This was not the direction that HTTP was first intended, and the NSA in USA or the NIS
in Korea now has the ability to monitor us with just a few servers. Now government can
block  specific  content  at  its  own  discretion  and  monitor  real-time  chat  history.
Centralized servers are exposed to DDoS attacks and various hacking risks and are
being attempted to hack them for the purpose of obtaining personal information.
As a result, Verizon, which acquired Yahoo's Internet business in October 2017, said
that it was revealed late that hacking damage occurred in August 2013 amounted to 3
billion  user  accounts.  The  victims  included  Yahoo's  Tumblr  and  Flicker.  In  addition,
Oracle's payment subsidiary, Micros, has also been hacked on user information, and
Linked-in has revealed that 6.5 million user passwords were leaked in 2012.
Recently, Big Data has become one of the core strategies of future corporations, and
the kinds and amounts of personal information they collect are increasing. However,
with the centralization of personal data, these companies, which store a large number
of customer information, are becoming a good prey such as a honey pot for hackers,
and the practice of actually being hacked is repeated over and over. Information once
leaked cannot be reversed and is being exploited for crimes such as voice phishing.
AIDUS can decentralize the Web so that it would prevent few powerful organizations or
companies controlling the Web. This will lead to the recovery of the sovereignty of
personal information, and if the personal information provider can directly select the
object that can be provided with their personal information after the web is distributed
and  the  personal  information  is  decentralized,  the  co-authentication  system  can
prevent the abuse of personal information and recover sovereignty to control their own
personal information.
In this regard, the AIDUS co-authentication system uses the latest Interplanetary File
System (IPFS) technology.
56




When an investor and an asset management company ask for sign up by using ADFP's
Web service, the personal information is uploaded as a file on the IPFS by BSON (Binary
JSON) serialization. At this time, the IPFS encrypts the corresponding file to provide a
Hash  Key  (Contents  Address),  which  is  owned  solely  by  the  investor  or  the  asset
management company itself. At this time, only the investor or the asset management
company having the provided key can browse the personal information, and then the
hash value and the decryption key of the file are registered in the SMART Contract. The
fund investor and the asset management company can make a bilateral transaction
from ADFP to Peer-To-Peer, and at this time, they can receive the personal information
of each other on the IPFS with mutual hash value and decryption key.
[ Figure 38 ] Co-Authentication Structure
2.1.3. Fund Information System
A system that allows the transfer of data from a centralized fund information provider
to  a  file  system  using  Blockchain  technology  or  by  the  Blockchain  itself  is  called
information system.
As a method of transferring data from a centralized data to a distributed environment,
AIDUS updates the fund information registered by the asset management company at
real time basis to the Blockchain network.
57




2.1.4. Wallet System
ADFP  provides wallet that is fully decentralized  and are able to trade peer-to-peer
funding by using the ETHEREUM-based Mobile Native APP wallets and Chrome Web
browser-based extension programs such as the MetaMask or MyEtherWallet.
The investor can purchase the fund through the AIDUS coin, and The ADIUS coin is
transferred  from  the  investor's  wallet  to  the  asset  management  company’s  wallet
through SMART Contract, and at the same time, the transaction hash information is
registered in the ETHEREUM Network. At this time, the asset management company
acquires  the  authority  to  view  the  member  information  of  the  investor,  and  the
member information of the fund can be viewed through the IPFS.
The amount of the valuation at maturity / redemption is calculated by referring to the
information of the information system. However, the method of calculating the fund
redemption fee differs for each fund, and the investor's evaluation fee will be paid by
coin or cash through the SMART Contract after charging the fund redemption fee.
[ Figure 39 ] ADFP-based Decentralized Fund Market Wallet System Access Structure

2.2. Why ETHEREUM Network?
The ETHEREUM Network is a platform for distributed ecosystems.
The ADFP decentralized fund market requires SMART Contract in order to perform
complex fund transactions. In this regard, the ETHEREUM is the first-ever Blockchain
network to allow SMART contracts.
In the third phase of the roadmap, Byzantium in metropolis was upgraded based on the
4,370,000th block in October 2017, and the TPS problem and mining upgrade (POW ->
POS) will be completed through the upgrade of Constantinople.
The Blockchain ledger should be able to handle more complex transactions than simply
sending and receiving values but rather it should enable entering of data, transmitting
state values and performing complex requests and calls.
Also, since we use the ERC-20 token that can be further expanded in the Blockchain,
the ETHEREUM network guarantees the most suitable environment for the ADFP. We
are  fully  aware  of  ADFP's  potential  problems  in  the  ETHEREUM  network  and  are
working to maximize the potential for ADFP to grow for further diverse applications.
2.2.1. SMART Contract
The fund market needs more features than to sending tokens. The distributed fund
market  requires  Blockchain  ledger  to  execute  more  complex  transactions  than  the
basic  transmitting  and  receiving  of  value.  The  core  competence  of  ETHEREUM  is
SMART Contracts, which provides the ability to extensively use the Blockchain ledgers.
SMART Contracts provide a solution for executing commands on Blockchain network.
These data can store, retrieve, and process data on the ETHEREUM Blockchain network
and distribute code that cannot be modified once it has been deployed in the network.
The basic function of SMART Contract in terms of fund contract is the storage of data.
This  data  includes  information  about  the  contracted  fund,  funding  amount,  fund
contracting party information, and fund schedule. The information mentioned above
can  be  used  to  conduct  mutual  fund  transactions  between  a  trusted  asset
management company and the investor. However, we may need more than the above
59




data when we want a viable solution for mutual fund dealings between investors and
asset  management  companies  that  do  not  have  information  on  the  contracting
counterpart.
2.2.2. Decentralized Application (DAPP)
Distributed fund market
ETHEREUM  provides  an  ecosystem  for  the  fund  market  that  is  executed  on  the
Blockchain network.
Through the distributed fund market, all transactions are conducted on the Blockchain,
and all data related to the funds are stored and executed on the Blockchain network,
which provides security, trust and transparency between the investor and the asset
management company.
SMART Contract
ETHEREUM-based SMART Contract provides ecosystems that create transactions even
without prior trust established between the parties. All transactions  are performed
using SMART Contract. That is, contracts (code) cannot be manipulated or tampered
because the  code  runs on the Blockchain and  the  ADFP copies  the  information to
multiple nodes.
SMART Contract for distributed fund market
SMART Contract is suitable for distributed platforms, and SMART Contract can handle
complex transactions such as future payments, token transfers, and any kind of closing
/ redemption  execution.  Moreover,  SMART  Contract  also  need  to  store  information
about investors on the Blockchain, so the information can be stored and categorized as
there are important data for the fund contract on the Blockchain.

VII. AIDUS ICO PLAN
1. Overview of AIDUS Token Sales Plan
The AIDUS Coin, carrying out the critical role in the ADFP-based decentralized fund
market, shall be acquired through the token presale in the form of an ICO(Initial Coin
Offering). The tokens offered in the ICO shall be based in ERC-2o token format, and can
be  used  in  the  fund  market  once  the  AIDUS  Global  D-Fund  Platform-based
decentralized fund market is launched. Moreover, once the AIDUS Main-Net is launched
in later phases, the token shall be changed into the AIDUS Coin at 1:1 ratio.
[ Table 1 ] Overview of AIDUS Token Sales Plan
The total of  20  billion AIDUS tokens shall be minted/issued, of which only  2  billion
(exclusive of bonus tokens) AIDUS tokens (AID) shall be distributed through the ICO.
61




2. Token Sales Schedule and Details
The AIDUS Token sales shall go through three different phases starting from private
presale to public presale then to the public sale phase. Should the Hard Cap be reached
at any phase, the following sales phase may not take place.
[ Table 2 ] AIDUS Token Sales Schedule and Details
※ Rate for the ETHEREUM payment shall be announced 24 hours prior to each phase of sales
plan
62




3. AIDUS Token Distribution Plan
[ Figure 40 ] AIDUS Token Distribution Plan
63




Sequential Coin Supply Plan
The  AIDUS  Project  Team  shall  be  issuing  about  13.27%  of  the  entire  AIDUS  token
through  the  ICO.  The  fund  volume  within  the  ADFP  Decentralized  Fund  Market  is
expected to expand in a gradual phase, which will be coupled with the growing demand
of AIDUS token liquidity in the market. Thus, the remaining 37.73% of the AIDUS token
shall be supplied to the market by AISYS GLOBAL in a sequential manner following the
expansion of the fund volume within the platform. The profits generated from the
sequential supplying of the AIDUS tokens by the AISYS GLOBAL shall be transparently
operated through the operation of the proprietary QTS and as well as for the liquidity
resource for the AMCs.
Coin Retirement Plan
The AIDUS Project Team is equipped with a long-term plan to protect the AIDUS token
value by first expanding the fund volume within the ADFP Decentralized Fund Market to
a certain level, and then retiring certain amount of token quantity each year using the
profits generated by the asset management of the proprietary QTS
