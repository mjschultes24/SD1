Concept
CLOUT aims to become the standard in quality for everything crypto -
news, media, and investment. It is an online based integrated software
that gives cryptocurrency investors a home.
Clout
/`Klout/
Influence or power, especially in politics or business
Introduction
User-generated content drives billions of dollars’ worth of revenue every
year. However, all the value created through the monetization of this
content never reaches the user themselves. It is instead reserved for a few
shareholders of the large social media outlets.
At the same time, the lack of curation that is put into this content creates
an ecosystem where fake news and misleading information thrive. Since
there are no incentives for high-quality content and no consequences for
low-quality content, the latter can end up being the most popular choice for
average users.
CLOUT aims to solve the issues by creating a new social-media platform
where curation is incentivized and where advertising revenue is shared
with the content creators, thus spreading the wealth that is generated
through digital content and further advancing the overall ethos of decen-
tralization and cryptocurrencies.

The CLOUT solution & mission
CLOUT is a blockchain-based platform for the cryptocurrency community. A
place where all sorts of information about the space can be accessed and
shared. CLOUT leverages blockchain technology as an incentive layer for
both users and readers, rewarding them for acting in the platform’s best
interests.
CLOUT provides users with an intuitive interface based on the familiar
social media concept. Users can monetize their crypto-related content,
ensuring that the wealth they generate is not diverted to any other
individual.  On the other hand, readers are financially incentivized to
monitor the platform and to curate content, promoting high-quality material
and demoting poorly written, inaccurate or plagiarized content.
By building CLOUT, we hope to create a hub for cryptocurrency and
blockchain enthusiasts, investors, and workers.  A place where they can
read and learn freely without fear of being misled. Although CLOUT is
focusing on the cryptosphere, the open source nature of the project can be
leveraged for other communities and ecosystems that may want to benefit
from the technology.

Digital Advertising Market
Today, online media and mobile content are the leaders of the publishing
industry. Offline content generated in a centralized manner (i.e. print)
does not see a high rate of social publishing nor does it create a signifi-
cant revenue stream for the creator or the sharer of said content.
According to research performed by eMarketer, the global internet adver-
tising expenditure totaled $178.5 billion in 2016 and it is expected to
grow to around $250 billion in the next two years. CLOUT expects not
only to tap into the growing digital advertising market, but also to trans-
form it. By allowing anyone to be part of the business, monopolies in the
industry can be torn down, allowing it to become more efficient and
transparent.
Users will be rewarded for creating and curating the highest quality and
most relevant content. Creators and investors in noteworthy projects will
now have a tool to maximize their influence (or clout) in the crypto space,
maximizing their value.

Blockchain technology
Blockchain technology works as a digital, distributed ledger in which
transactions, balances, wallet addresses, and more are chronologically
recorded. Information stored on the blockchain is both public and
immutable.
Although the blockchain industry is a new one, the growth potential can
only be compared to that of the internet in the late 90s. Just as search
engines, browsers, and social networks disrupted the information tech-
nology and communications sectors, blockchain platforms like Bitcoin,
Ethereum and others will force the hand of traditional institutions to
change their respective roles in the industry. Not only is the cryptocurren-
cy market growing at a remarkable speed, blockchain technology itself is
being adopted by established institutions with growing frequency.
Despite this undeniable trend, there is no content platform uniquely
dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Crypto is a
100-billion-dollar industry and yet it only has had a place as a sub-catego-
ry on the traditional platforms used by the crypto community to get their
information.
On the other hand, the cryptocurrency space also suffers from a gross
“over saturation” of media and investment content. Over 1.2 million+
posts and 250+ hours of video are uploaded each day, since the begin-
ning of 2017, under the broad subject matter of “Cryptocurrency.”
The blockchain has made an immense impact on society and it is here to
stay. Major businesses and corporations have not been able to deny the
technological and financial advancements that blockchain technology
brings to the world. The entire blockchain community is desperate for a
place dedicated to it and only it. A place where the community can truly
thrive as its rapid adoption continues worldwide.

The CLOUT Platform
The CLOUT Platform leverages blockchain technology to provide a
multi-language platform where content creators and curators are incen-
tivized to post and share high quality content globally. Through the
CLOUT Platform, users will be able to create an account, edit their
profile, search and find content, interact with the built-in CLOUT wallet
and start posting and sharing posts.
The CLOUT Platform will feature a familiar and intuitive user interface
with the common characteristics of a social media platform. CLOUT will
implement Artificial Intelligence to automatically compose user views
ensuring that each user is always greeted with the most relevant con-
tent, according to prior activity.
Users will be able to register or login with their account or through their
Facebook, twitter or google accounts. Once the account has been creat-
ed, the user is free to edit his profile, including the profile picture,
description, contacts, and more. The user dashboard will also feature a
built-in wallet for the ERC223 CLOUT and CLC tokens.
A vital part of the CLOUT ecosystem, the CLC tokens act as the incen-
tive layer for content creators and sharers. By holding the CLOUT token,
users will be able to receive CLC in yearly batches. The CLC token acts
as the fuel for the platform and is required to create, rate, like or share
content within CLOUT. If a member's post or comment is rated accurate
or liked by the community, a percentage of the CLC gathered will be
paid back to the original poster.

Unlike most social media platforms, CLOUT will launch as a cryptocurren-
cy-centric platform in which content will revolve around the blockchain space,
cryptocurrency projects, ICOs, and so on. This approach allows the communi-
ty to grow in an organic manner, acting as an information hub for cryptocur-
rency users which can later turn into a more generic platform in which, for
example, technology, economy or trading, are discussed.
By focusing on the crypto-sphere as the platform’s kickstarter theme, CLOUT
will also provide a much-needed information hub for cryptocurrency inves-
tors, who are currently bombarded with content every day. By creating an
incentive for quality posts, CLOUT will ensure that writers are incentivized to
create honest and impartial reviews or articles, instead of being paid by the
companies they are writing about. By doing so, content creators, noteworthy
projects, investors and more, have the necessary tools to increase their
influence in the cryptocurrency space.
Other massive problems for today’s cryptocurrency investor are the scams
and phishing attempts that plague the current “user-driven” communities
online. Every single day, hackers come up with new ways to try to steal coins
that do not belong to them. We are familiar with the common scams and do
the due diligence needed to avoid them.  However, the often larger and most
intricate scams are the ones that sell themselves as an ICO. CLOUT is going
to provide a much-needed vetting process of ICOs for users.  The CLOUT
platform will evaluate and provide analysis of all current and upcoming ICOs.
As the blockchain continues to grow, CLOUT is going to help establish a
much-needed standard of quality for today’s ICO space.
CLOUT’s network provides the following functions for users:
•A “home base” for cryptocurrency news and media. It consolidates all infor-
mation from various platforms and maintains the integrity of the content
through a reward system.
•A platform for content sharers and creators alike with constant incentivizes
to make quality contributions through its daughter token, CLC.

chain technology.
Platform Development
CLOUT is more than just an idea. We have begun designing and developing
the CLOUT platform. Creating a revolutionary platform with maximum func-
tionality for the user is our #1 priority. Building CLOUT is a challenging, yet
exciting process since CLOUT’s functions differently from other blockchain
networks by design. The coding reflects these difficult and intricate
advancements within the system.
The CLOUT Platform will run the following programming languages:
•                                                                                 Angular 2
•                                                                                 Python
•                                                                                 PostgreSQL
•                                                                                 Ethereum Smart Contracts
Our vision for utilizing the blockchain as an incentive system for CLOUT is
essential to cryptocurrency mass adoption. In terms of storage, the CLOUT
Platform is going to use decentralized distributed storage networks such as
IPFS. CLOUT developers will incorporate a distributed application execution
and are monitoring many major distributed computation platforms. CLOUT
plans on hosting major components of the system on such platforms once
closer to the production phase of development.

CLOUT smart contracts functionality will reset today’s standards. The
ability to release tokens at a decaying rate over time is just one of the
advancements in smart contracts that allows CLOUT to help protect
users. Participants will no longer lose contributions immediately after
an ICO following a massive sell-off of tokens at one time.
CLOUT smart contracts are developed using:
•                                                                           Solidity v.0.4.13
•                                                                           JavaScript Truffle + Mocha (for automated tests)

Token and Economic Model
The CLOUT Platform has two native tokens:
•
•
CLOU                                                                           e mining
conce                                                                          t those
who r                                                                          platform,
which directly incentivizes them to act in its best interest.
The initial amount of CLC is equal to the amount of CLOUT and will be
distributed to the token sale participants at a 1-1 ratio. Only 100 million
CLOUT tokens will ever be created. A maximum of 1 billion CLC will be
generated throughout the lifetime of the CLOUT Platform.
CLOUT generates its first batch of CLC at a rate of 1-1 per year through a
process known as “auto genesis mining”. Every subsequent batch of CLC
will take one additional year to generate. For example, the first batch will
be generated one year after the close of the ICO, the second batch will
generate 2 years later, the third batch after the 3rd year, etc. CLOUT that
is transferred to a different address will have the subsequent CLC credit-
ed to that new address.
page11




CLOUT purchased during the ICO will receive the corresponding CLC at no
cost. Any CLOUT purchased after the ICO closes will need to wait for it to
generate additional CLC or purchase it on its own. The CLC token will be
distributed proportionally in accordance with the CLOUT tokens held. With the
increasing rate of new block generation, the total limit of CLC will be achieved
in 2062. CLOUT holders can initiate a transaction at any time to claim their
CLC tokens to their wallet addresses. Users will have access to their CLOUT
and CLC following their purchase in the ICO.
CLC issuance schedule:
1.                                                                                 Post ICO (Nov 2017) -

ERC-223 Token S
The CLOUT ecosystem is based on an open source cryptographic ERC-223
token named CLOUT (CLOUT Token). CLOUT is fractionally divisible, transfer-
able and functional.
The ERC-223 tokens ability to eliminate the problem of “lost tokens” was an
important function for the CLOUT token to ensure a safer transfer system. If a
participant accidentally sends ETH from an exchange to CLOUT’s ICO deposit
address, the ETH sent can be returned instead of being eliminated, unlike
ERC-20 tokens.
The ERC-223 tokens use half the gas required by an ERC-20 token. The deci-
sion to improve this aspect of functionality ultimately benefits and safeguards
our current and future participants.

Token Allocation
CLOUT’s 100 million token supply is allocated as so:
1. 2.5 million tokens distributed to project early adopters during pre-ICO sale
2. 10 million tokens (10%) will be distributed to project supporters during the
token sale.
3. 30 million tokens (30%) will be used to motivate developers and pay bounties
used to develop the CLOUT Platform.
4. 25 million tokens (25%) will be allocated to the CLOUT Fund and will be used
to invest in other blockchain projects over time, including ICOs and/or
cryptocurrencies. These investment decisions will be based on the highest
rated opportunities by the “up-voting” of the CLOUT platform members.
5. 22.5 million tokens (22.5%) will be used to motivate the CLOUT developers
and executives overtime.
6. 5 million tokens (5%) will be retained by the founders (To be released during
a 20-month period)
7. 5 million tokens (5%) to be released every 1 year over the next 5 years, based
on certain milestones in the CLOUT roadmap being achieved.
page13




Token Sale
To fund the development and marketing of the CLOUT platform and to ensure
a fair and transparent distribution method, CLOUT is hosting a token sale.
The CLOUT token sale will be divided in two stages, the pre-ICO and the main
ICO.
Pre-ICO
•2.5 million tokens (2.5%) will be distributed during the Pre-ICO at $1/ CLOUT
The Pre-ICO started on the 27th of September and will end on the 17th of
November or when 2.5 million CLOUT tokens are sold. During the Pre-ICO, fiat
currencies, BTC and ETH are accepted. There is a 1 BTC / 10 ETH minimum
participation requirement.
ICO
•5 million tokens (5%) will be distributed during Phase 1 ICO at $2.50/ CLOUT
•3 million tokens (3%) will be distributed during Phase 2 ICO at $5/ CLOUT
•2 million tokens (2%) will be distributed during Phase 3 ICO at $10/ CLOUT
The ICO will start on the 17th of November, following the Pre-ICO. The ICO
will last for 30 days (December 17, 2017) or until the 10 million tokens are
sold. During the ICO, BTC and ETH will be accepted. There is a 0.5 ETH
minimum participation amount.
Pre Sale and ICO will have a registration process where identity
documentation is collected, verified and married to the wallet address, phone
number and email provided. 2FA will be required to authenticate phone
numbers. Identity documents must verify residential address and email must
be confirmed. *Individuals from areas of “high-risk” or participation amounts
greater than $13,160USD need to provide additional data (source of wealth,
funds etc).
Hard Cap: $50 million Individual Cap: $1 million
page14




Distribution of the CLOUT tokens will be done via smart contract.  The
CLOUT smart contracts will be audited by the independent professional
company ICOrating (www.icorating.com).  Tokens not sold during the ICO
will be burned.
Funding breakdown
The CLOUT project will use of proceeds from the sale to fund the opera-
tions and development of the CLOUT platform. The following funding
breakdown was devised assuming the $50M USD cap is raised*:
•                                                                              40% Marketing (Growing CLOUT brand)
•                                                                              30% Research and Development (R&D)
•                                                                              15% Bilateral Business Relationships
•                                                                              10% Misc.
•                                                                              5% Legal
Marketing: Our marketing efforts include enhancing cooperation with
potential new members and operators to allow as many people to join the
platform as possible. Additionally, we plan to focus our efforts on market-
ing CLOUT to broad audiences on traditional social media platforms, estab-
lished cryptocurrency media outlets, and other traditional resources.
CLOUT tokens will also be used as incentives to join the network, creating a
network effect.
R&D: The CLOUT platform will be on the cutting edge of today’s technologi-
cal advancements. R&D funding will allow the team to research and devel-
op the platform, the CLOUT token, CLC daughter token and all their func-
tionalitie
page15




Bilateral Business Relationship: Establishing relationships with businesses
that can benefit CLOUT’s vision to decentralize media, ultimately catalyzing
the growth of Blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency community.
Miscellaneous: Unexpected financial situations such as the underestimation
of the previous categories’ funding allocations.
Legal: Retaining legal counsel for the CLOUT Platform.
Bilateral Business Relationship: Establishing relationships with businesses
*The expected breakdown may be altered as the project progresses.
Although team CLOUT has a clear plan to ensure that the value of the CLOUT
token can be upheld, the main value propositions come not from the value of
the token itself, but rather from the revenue streams that are open to plat-
form contributors.
Multiple Benefits for Users:
•                                                                                Crowd Wisdom
•                                                                                Referral Program Crowd Wisdom
The concept of “Wisdom of the crowds” is not new and it has been leveraged
by previous platforms within the blockchain space. However, CLOUT’s
approach to this concept is unique, leveraging it not as a betting or guessing
mechanism, but rather as a curation tool. This tool is powered by the CLC
token which acts as a reward for the participants.
page16




CLC tokens represent the user's voice on the CLOUT platform, allowing him to
take advantage the platform in its full capacity, with the ability to share, rate
and create content. Without CLC, users can still access the CLOUT network in
a “read only” mode but cannot contribute to the community, and therefore,
cannot be rewarded.
A user who creates a popular post, makes an accurate prediction or shares a
quality media post is rewarded with CLC. Users are incentivized to keep their
CLC so that they can interact with the platform and earn benefits while
CLOUT holders are incentivized to keep their tokens to receive auto-mined
CLC according to the defined economic model.
Referral Program
CLOUT token holders will receive a certain amount of CLC tokens based on
how many new members they refer to the CLOUT Network.
CLC will be rewarded to users who refer new subscribers to the CLOUT
network based on a tiered system. The earlier the referral on the CLOUT road-
map, the bigger the CLC reward. Referrals are rewarded as so:
• Referrals made post-ICO - December will receive 1 CLC.
• Referrals made Q1-2018- Q2-2018 will receive .75 CLC.
• Referrals made post-Q2-2018 will receive .5 CLC
page17




Longevity
CLOUT has an emphasis on long term growth built into its business
model. The goal is to be the place where media meets cryptocurrency.
So much so that CLOUT team members are to receive their CLOUT token
positions on a timed-release schedule.  Each CLOUT team member will
realize 5% of their total tokens per month for 20 months following the
completion of the ICO. This system ensures that no team member could
potentially compromise the growth of the token value in the open
market. In addition to self-monitoring within the team 5% of the total
number CLOUT tokens are set to be distributed over the course of the
project roadmap over the next 5 years. Over 40% of the total number of
CLOUT tokens are to be allocated to the advancement of the CLOUT
project. Over HALF of the total number of CLOUT tokens are to be rein-
vested into the CLOUT project in the long term.
By releasing 1 million tokens each year for the next 5 years CLOUT
intends on showing supporters it is not a “pump” token. Safeguards are
being built directly into the smart contracts created by CLOUT develop-
ers. The CLOUT team members main priorities are the advancement of
CLOUT and to make an overall positive impact on the growth of the
cryptocurrency community. We intend to grow with the entire market
and become the flagship platform of cryptocurrency.

CONCLUSION
Currently, cryptocurrency investors are forced to choose from a variety of
different social media platforms when looking to access quality informa-
tion pertaining to cryptocurrency. Platforms like Reddit, Facebook, Steemit
are the only option for users. These websites are social media networks
first and foremost and when crypto-related content is featured, it is always
reduced to a sub-category of the platform. Reddit alone has over 50 differ-
ent “sub-Reddits” dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.
Steemit’s reputation system largely compromises the integrity of informa-
tion on it because it allows a small group of users with a high “reputation”
level to dictate much of the content on the site.
Cryptocurrency has grown into a $100 billion-dollar market that will contin-
ue to grow exponentially as it continues to spark the public interest. Howev-
er, blockchain technology enthusiasts and investors alike are forced to
navigate multiple platforms, multiple subcategories. With what seems like
a never-ending sea of inaccurate or biased posts when looking for new
information.  The crypto-community deserves a platform that is exclusively
dedicated to it and only it: CLOUT - Media Decentralized.

page21




1. CLOUT Platform
1.1 CLOUT promotes and develops modern technologies and applica-
tions, especially in the fields of new open and decentralized software
architecture. CLOUT’s core focus (but not exclusive focus) is on the
promotion and development of the CLOUT platform and related technol-
ogies, as well and the promotion and support of applications that use
the CLOUT platform. The CLOUT is developing a blockchain based pro-
tocol aimed at providing decentralized solutions for SOCIAL MEDIA
PLATFORMs (the “CLOUT Platform”).
2. Scope of Contribution Terms
2.1 Save as otherwise set out in these Contribution Terms, these Contri-
bution Terms (including any terms incorporated herein by reference)
govern only your contribution to CLOUT for the purchase of Tokens
during the Contribution Period (as such terms are defined in clauses 3.1
and 3.2 respectively below).
2.2 Any potential future use of the Tokens in connection with provision
or receipt of services on the CLOUT Platform shall be subject to and
governed by such other applicable terms, conditions and policies relat-
ing to the use of the CLOUT Platform (“Platform Terms”). Such Platform
Terms will be made available to CLOUT Platform users, if the CLOUT
Platform is successfully developed and deployed.
2.3 For a more detailed description of the CLOUT Platform, please refer
to the CLOUT website at www.CLOUT.IO and the CLOUT Whitepaper (a
copy of which can be found at: https://www.CLOUT.IO/assets/-
clout-whitepaper.pdf . The information contained in the CLOUT White-
paper and on the CLOUT website are of descriptive nature only, are not
binding and do not form part of these Contribution Terms.
page22




3. Creation and issue of Tokens through the Smart Contract System
3.1 CLOUT has deployed a smart contract system (the “Smart Contract
System” or “SCS”) on the Ethereum blockchain for the purposes of
receiving contributions, creating its own proprietary CLOUT tokens
(“Tokens”) and issuing such Tokens to the Ethereum
wallet from which the contribution was received. The Token created
shall be based on the ERC223 token standard.
3.2 The Smart Contract System shall be made available to receive con-
tributions, create Tokens and issue Tokens for a defined period of time
(“Contribution Period”). The
Contribution Period shall commence on 17th of November 2017 at UTC
12:00 and shall end on satisfaction of one of the following “Completion
Conditions” (whichever is the earlier):
a) USD 50 million worth of Ether contributions are received by the Smart
Contract System; or
b) The expiry of 4 weeks from the commencement of the Contribution
Period.
3.3 The creation and issue of Tokens shall be initiated by the Contribu-
tor transferring an amount in Ether (“ETH”) during the Contribution
Period to the Smart Contract System, located on the Ethereum block-
chain at [the address to be published on
www.CLOUT.IO when the Contribution Period commences. The Smart
Contract
System’s receipt of the contribution in Ether from the Contributor will
trigger a smart contract operation whereby Tokens will be created and
issued to the Ethereum wallet address from which the contribution was
received.
page23




3.4 The Smart Contract System shall only accept contributions that are
made in ETH. The Smart Contract System will not accept any contribu-
tions made in fiat currencies or any crypto-currencies (other than ETH).
3.5 Only the Smart Contract System existing at the addresses referred
to in clause 3.3 will be able to accept contributions and create and issue
Tokens during the Contribution Period. To the extent that any third-party
website, service or smart-contract offers Tokens during the Contribu-
tion Period or facilitates the allocation or transfer of Tokens in any way
during the Contribution Period or at any time up to the release of the
Genesis Block, such third-party websites or services are, unless
expressly set out in these Contribution Terms or mentioned on the
CLOUT website referred to in clause 3.3,  not authorized by CLOUT nor
do they have any legal or commercial relationship in any way with
CLOUT, the Tokens or the CLOUT Platform. Contributors who send con-
tributions to any third- party website, service or smart contract that
offers Tokens in the manner described in this clause 3.5, risk losing
their entire contribution and CLOUT shall not be responsible or liable for
recovering or returning any such contributions to the Contributor nor
shall CLOUT be responsible or liable for any losses incurred by the
Contributor in this respect.
3.6 In order to receive Tokens created and issued by the Smart Contract
System as described in clause 3.3, you shall send contributions to the
Smart Contract System from an Ethereum wallet that supports the
ERC223 token standard (in other words the Contributor’s Ethereum
wallet must possess technical infrastructure that is compatible with the
receipt, storage, holding and transfer of the Tokens, being tokens that
are created based on the ERC223 token standard). CLOUT reserves the
right to prescribed additional conditions relating to the specific wallet
requirements at any time acting in its sole and absolute discretion.
page24




3.7 Contributions received by the Smart Contract System shall be the
sole and exclusive property of CLOUT, who shall be entitled to apply
such contributions towards the development of the CLOUT Platform and
for other operational expenses of the Company. Subject to clause 3.9
below, you irrevocably and unconditionally waive any rights which you
have or may in the future have to claim title to or reimbursement of any
contributions received by the Smart Contract System.
3.7 Token Price: During the Contribution Period, the Smart Contract
System shall create and issue 2.5M presale, 5M Tier 1, 3M Tier2, 2M
Tier 3
Minimum Target: CLOUT has imposed a minimum aggregate
contribution target
equivalent to USD 5 million (“Minimum Target”). If on conclusion of the
Contribution Period pursuant to clause 3.2b), the aggregate sum of all
contributions received by the Smart Contract System is less than the
Minimum Target, CLOUT shall, within a reasonable period of time,
exercise reasonable endeavors to procure that contributions are
returned to the Ethereum wallet address from which the contribution
was received.
4. Refunds, Refusals, Suspension and Termination of Contributions
4.1SContribution Terms are final and Contributors shall not be entitled
to any refund or return of contributions from CLOUT, except to the
extent required by applicable law.
page25




4.2 CLOUT reserves the right, through the Smart Contract System or
otherwise, to refuse or reject any contributions made at any time in our
sole and absolute discretion. To the extent that we refuse or reject a
contribution, we will exercise reasonable endeavors to procure that the
contribution is recovered and returned to the Ethereum wallet from
which the contribution was made, however, we do not warrant, represent
or offer any assurances that we will successfully be able to recover
and/or return any such contributions.
4.3 At any time prior to satisfaction of the Completion Conditions,
CLOUT may either temporarily suspend or permanently abort the
Contribution Period for security reasons. Any suspension or abort of the
Contribution Period shall be deemed to commence from the moment
that CLOUT publishes a notice to that effect on its website at
www.CLOUT.IO .
4.4 During any period of suspension or in the event that the
Contribution Period is aborted, the Smart Contract System will no
longer be able to receive and accept contributions, create Tokens
and/or issue Tokens to Contributors. Contributors who send
contributions to the Smart Contract System, after CLOUT has published
a notice that the Contribution Period has been suspended or aborted in
accordance with clause 4.3, risk losing their entire contribution and
CLOUT shall not be responsible or liable for recovering or returning any
such contributions to the Contributor nor shall we be responsible or
liable for any losses incurred by the Contributor in this respect. You are
therefore strongly advised to check the website link set out in clause
4.3 above before sending a contribution to the Smart Contract System.
5. Token Functionality
Ownership of Tokens carries no rights, whether express or implied,
other than a limited potential future right or expectation to use and
interact with the CLOUT Platform (as further described in the White
Paper ), if and to the extent the CLOUT Platform is successfully
developed and launched. .
page




PLEASE NOTE THAT CLOUT IS IN THE PROCESS OF UNDERTAKING A
LEGAL AND REGULATORY ANALYSIS OF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF
TOKENS. FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF THIS ANALYSIS, CLOUT
MAY DECIDE TO AMEND THE INTENDED FUNCTIONALITY OF TOKENS
IN ORDER TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LEGAL OR REGULATO-
RY REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH IT IS SUBJECT.
You acknowledge and accept that Tokens do not represent or consti-
tute:
a) Any ownership right or stake, share, equity, security, commodity,
bond, debt instrument or any other financial instrument or investment
carrying equivalent rights;
b) Any right to receive future revenues, shares or any other form of
participation or governance right in or relating to CLOUT and/or the
CLOUT Platform;
c) Any form of money or legal tender in any jurisdiction, nor do they
constitute any representation of money (including electronic money); or
d) the provision of any goods and/or services as at the date that these
Contribution Terms form a binding agreement between the Parties.
5.4   Protections offered by applicable law in relation to the purchase,
holding and/or sale of the instruments and/or investments referred to in
clause 5.2 above shall not apply to any contribution made under these
Contribution Terms for the purchase of Tokens or to your holding or
sale of Tokens.
5.5 CLOUT makes no warranties or representations and offers no assur-
ances (in each case whether express or implied) that the Tokens shall
confer any actual and/or exercisable rights of use, functionality, fea-
tures, purpose or attributes in connection with CLOUT Platform.
page27




6. Audit of the Smart Contract System
6.1 CLOUT has exercised reasonable endeavors to have the Smart
Contract System audited and approved by technical experts. The tech-
nical experts have confirmed that the Smart Contract System has, with
regard to both accuracy and security, been programmed in accordance
with best industry practice.
6.2 Notwithstanding clause 6.1, smart contract technology is still in an
early development stage and its application is currently of an experi-
mental nature, which carries significant operational, technological,
financial, regulatory and reputational risks. Accordingly, while the audit
conducted raises the level of security and accuracy of the Smart Con-
tract System, you acknowledge, understand and accept that the audit
does not amount to any form of warranty, representation or assurance
(in each case whether express or implied) that the Smart Contract
System and the Token are fit for a particular purpose or that they are
free from any defects, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, viruses or bugs
which could cause, inter alia, the complete loss of ETH contributions
and/or Tokens.
7. Security
7.1 You are responsible for implementing all reasonable and appropri-
ate measures for securing the wallet, vault or other storage mechanism
you use to receive and store Tokens that are issued to you by the Smart
Contract System, including any requisite private key(s) or other creden-
tials necessary to access such storage mechanism(s). If your private
key(s) or other access credentials are lost, you may lose access to your
Tokens. We are not responsible for any security measures relating to
your receipt, possession, storage, transfer or potential future use of
Tokens nor are we under any obligation to recover or return any Tokens
and we hereby exclude (to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law) any and all liability for any security breaches or other acts or omis-
sions which result in your loss of (including your loss of access to)
Tokens.
page28




8. Right to Request Information
8.1 We may determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, that it is
necessary to obtain certain information about you in order to comply
with applicable law or regulation in connection with creation and issue
of Tokens to you. You agree to provide us such information promptly
upon request, and you acknowledge and accept that we may refuse or
reject any contributions for the purchase of Tokens until you provide
such requested information and we have determined that it is permissi-
ble to create and issue Tokens to you under applicable law or regulation.
9. Indemnity
9.1 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify,
defend and hold harmless CLOUT and our respective past, present and
future employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, equity
holders, suppliers, vendors, service providers, parent companies, sub-
sidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors
and assigns (the “CLOUT Parties”) from and against any and all claims,
demands, actions, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including
reasonable professional and legal fees) that arise from or relate to: (i)
your acquisition or use of Tokens; (ii) the performance or non-perfor-
mance of your responsibilities or obligations under these Contribution
Terms; (iii) your violation of these Contribution Terms; or (iv) your viola-
tion of any rights of any other person or entity.
9.2 CLOUT reserves the right to exercise sole control over the defense,
at your sole cost and expense, of any claim subject to indemnity set out
in clause 9.1. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any
other remedies that may be available to CLOUT under applicable law. .
Disclaimers
10. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and except as
otherwise specified in writing by us:
page29




a) the Tokens are sold on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without any
warranties or representations of any kind, and we expressly disclaim all
warranties and representations relating to the to the Tokens (whether
express or implied), including, without limitation, any implied warranties
of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-in-
fringement;
b) we do not represent or warrant that the Tokens are reliable, current or
error-free, meet your requirements, or that any defects Tokens will be
corrected; and
c) we cannot and do not represent or warrant that the Tokens or the
delivery mechanism for Tokens are free of viruses or other harmful
components.
10.2 Neither these Contribution Terms nor the CLOUT Whitepaper con-
stitute a prospectus or offering document, and are not an offer to sell,
nor the solicitation of an offer to buy any investment or financial instru-
ment in any jurisdiction. Tokens should not be acquired for speculative
or investment purposes with the expectation of making a profit on
immediate-sale.
11. Limitation of Liability
11.1 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no circum-
stances shall:
a) CLOUT or any of the CLOUT Parties be liable for any direct, indirect,
special, incidental or consequential loss of any kind (including, but not
limited to, loss of revenue, income, business or profits, loss of contract
or depletion of goodwill, loss of anticipated savings, loss of use or data,
or damages for business interruption or any like loss) arising out of or
in any way related to the acquisition, storage, transfer or use of the
tokens or otherwise related to these Contribution Terms, regardless of
the cause of action, whether based in contract, through (including, but
not
page30




12.1 Risk of software weaknesses: the Smart Contract System concept,
the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the
Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage and unprov-
en. There is no warranty or assurance that the process for creating
Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk
that the software could contain defects, weaknesses, vulnerabilities,
viruses or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of ETH contribu-
tions and/or Tokens.
12.2 Regulatory risk: blockchain technology allows new forms of inter-
action and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing
regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain
technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current
setup of the Smart Contract System and which may, inter alia, result in
substantial modifications to the Smart Contract System and/or the
CLOUT Platform, including its termination and the loss of Tokens for the
Contributor. Additionally, regulation of SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM
applications is uncertain in various jurisdictions owing to the potential
crossovers that SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMs have into gambling, finan-
cial services and blockchain technology laws and regulations. It is not
known what regulatory framework the proposed CLOUT Platform and
associated applications will be caught by, the nature and obligations
that will be imposed on CLOUT in order to comply with any such regula-
tory framework or when/if CLOUT will even be able to apply to be regu-
lated so that it may lawfully carry out its proposed business activities.
12.3 Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement
Actions: the regulatory status of the Tokens and distributed ledger
technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to
predict how or whether regulatory authorities may apply existing regula-
tion with respect to such technology and its applications, including the
CLOUT Platform and the Tokens. It is likewise difficult to predict how or
whether legislatures or regulatory authorities may implement changes
to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its
applications, including the CLOUT Platform and the Tokens
page31




Regulatory actions could negatively impact the CLOUT Platform and the
Tokens in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only,
through a determination that Tokens are a regulated financial instru-
ment that requires registration or licensing. CLOUT may cease opera-
tions in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to
law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or com-
mercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to
operate in such jurisdiction.
12.4 Risk of abandonment / lack of success: the creation and issue of
the Tokens and the development of the CLOUT Platform may be aban-
doned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the
public, lack of fun12ng, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g.
caused by competing projects). You therefore understand and accept
that there is no warranty or assurance that, even if the CLOUT Platform
is partially or fully developed and launched, you will receive any bene-
fits through the Tokens that you hold.
12.5 Risk associated with other applications: the CLOUT Platform may
give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third
parties, under  which Tokens will  have no intrinsic value.
12.6 Risk of loss of private key: Tokens can only be accessed by using
an Ethereum wallet with a combination of the Contributor’s account
information (address), private key and password. The private key is
encrypted with a password. You acknowledge, understand and accept
that if your private key or password gets lost or stolen, the obtained
Tokens associated with your account (address) or password will be
unrecoverable and will be permanently lost. Additionally, any third party
that gains access to your private key, including by gaining access to the
login credentials relating to your Ethereum wallet, may be able to mis-
appropriate your Tokens.
page32




12.7 Risk of theft: the Smart Contract System concept, the underlying
software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum block-
chain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals
including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks,
consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Any
such successful attacks could result in theft or loss of Tokens or ETH,
adversely impacting the ability to develop the CLOUT Platform and
derive any usage or functionality from the Tokens. Furthermore,
because the CLOUT Platform is based on open-source software, there is
a risk that a third party or a member of the CLOUT team may intention-
ally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or defects into the core
infrastructure of the CLOUT Platform, which could negatively affect the
CLOUT Platform and the Tokens.
12.8 Risk of Ethereum mining attacks: as with other cryptocurrencies,
the blockchain used for the Smart Contract System is susceptible to
mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, ma-
jority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition
attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Smart Contract
System, expected proper execution and sequencing of Token transac-
tions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract com-
putations.
12.9 Risk of incompatible wallet service: the wallet or wallet service
provider used for the contribution, has to conform to the ERC223 token
standard in order to be be technically compatible with the Token. The
failure to ensure such conformity may have the result that Contributor
will not gain access to his Token.
12.10 Risk of Hard-Fork: the CLOUT Platform will need to go through
substantial development works as part of which it may become the
subject of significant conceptual, technical and commercial changes
before release. As part of the development
page33




an upgrade to the Token may be required (hard-fork of Token) and that,
if you decide not to participate in such upgrade, you may no longer be
able to use your Tokens and any non-upgraded Tokens may lose their
functionality in full.
12.11 Risk of Uninsured Losses: unlike bank accounts or accounts at
some other financial institutions, Tokens are uninsured unless you
specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event
of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insur-
ance arranged by us, to offer recourse to you.
12.12 Risks Arising from Taxation: the tax characterization of Tokens is
uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with acqui-
sition, storage, holding and use of Tokens, which may result in adverse
tax consequences to you, including, without limitation, withholding
taxes, transfer taxes, value added taxes, income taxes and similar
taxes, levies, duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements.
12.13 Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Ethereum and Other Curren-
cy Value: the CLOUT team intends to use the contributions received to
fund the maintenance and development of the CLOUT Platform. The
contributions received will be denominated in Ether, and may be con-
verted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of Ethe-
reum or other currencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the
Contribution Period, the CLOUT team may not be able to fund develop-
ment, or may not be able to maintain the CLOUT Platform in the manner
that it intended.
12.14 Risk of Dissolution of the Company or Network: it is possible that,
due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavor-
able fluctuation in the value of Ethereum (or other cryptographic and
fiat currencies), decrease in the Tokens’ utility due to negative
page34




adoption of the CLOUT Platform, the failure of commercial relation-
ships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the CLOUT Plat-
form may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dis-
solve.
12.15 Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights: because Tokens
confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the CLOUT
Platform or CLOUT, all decisions involving the CLOUT Platform or
CLOUT will be made by CLOUT acting in its sole and absolute discretion,
including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the CLOUT Plat-
form, to create and issue more Tokens for use in the CLOUT Platform, or
to sell or liquidate CLOUT. These decisions could adversely affect the
CLOUT Platform and/or the Tokens you hold.
12.16 Unanticipated Risks: cryptographic tokens such as the Tokens are
a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks set out in this
clause 12, there are other risks associated with your acquisition, stor-
age, transfer and use of Tokens, including those that CLOUT may not be
able to anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated
variations or combinations of the risks set out in this clause 12.

14. Taxation
14.1 You are solely responsible for determining whether your contribu-
tion into the Smart Contract System for the development of the CLOUT
Platform, the transfer of ETH, the creation, ownership, use or liquidation
of Token, the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of
TOKEN over time (if any), the allocation of Token and/or any other
action or transaction contemplated by these Contribution Terms or
related to the CLOUT Platform Protocol will give rise to any tax implica-
tions on your part.
14.2 You are also solely responsible for withholding, collecting, report-
ing, paying, settling and/or remitting any and all taxes to the appropriate
tax authorities in such jurisdiction(s) in which you may be liable to pay
tax. CLOUT shall not be responsible for withholding, collecting, report-
ing, paying, settling and/or remitting any sales, value added or similar
tax which may arise from your contribution and acquisition of Tokens
under or in connection with these Contribution Terms.

15. Miscellaneous
15.1 The User understands and accepts that the network of miners will
be ultimately in control of the Smart Contract System. The User under-
stands that a majority of these miners could agree at any point to make
changes to the official Smart Contract System and to run the new ver-
sion of the Smart Contract System. Such a scenario could lead to
TOKEN losing intrinsic value.
15.2 The User agrees that if any term, clause or provision of these
Contribution Terms is found illegal, void or unenforceable (in whole or
in part), then such term, clause or provision shall be severable from
these Contribution Terms without affecting the validity or enforceability
of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other
term, clause or provision of these Contribution Terms, which shall con-
tinue to be in full force and effect.
15.3 These Contribution Terms constitute the entire agreement
between the Parties in relation to its subject matter. These Contribution
Terms replace and extinguish any and all prior agreements, draft agree-
ments, arrangements, warranties, statements, assurances, representa-
tions and undertakings of any nature made by, or on behalf of the Par-
ties, whether oral or written, public or private, in relation to that subject
matter.
You acknowledge that by accepting these Contribution Terms, you have
not relied on any oral or written statements, warranties, assurances,
page40




representations and undertakings of any nature made by, or on behalf
of the Parties, whether oral or written, public or private, in relation to
that subject matter.
15.5 You acknowledge that by accepting these Contribution Terms, you
have not relied on any oral or written statements, warranties, assuranc-
es, representations or undertakings which were or may have been made

tribution Terms at any time before your acceptance of them (“Pre-Con-
tractual Statements”), other than those set out in these Contribution
Terms. You hereby waive any and all rights and remedies which might
otherwise be available in relation to such Pre- Contractual Statements.

ETH to the Smart Contract System and/or your receipt of Tokens) shall
be deemed to create any form of partnership, joint venture or any other
similar relationship between you and CLOUT and/or other individuals or
entities involved with the deployment of the Smart Contract System and
the development of the CLOUT Platform.
15.8 These Contribution Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of
or in connection with their subject matter or formation (including
non-contractual disputes and claims) shall be governed by and con-
strued in accordance with GIBRALTAR Law.
15.9 The Parties irrevocably agree that the GIBRALTAR courts shall
have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out
