Avoiding over-concentration risk
This factor is closely connected to mining adaptability. When analysing many of the current mining
operations that have been established for some time, we observed that in many cases the operations
were too focused on one particular coin. We wanted to avoid this and instead mine several coins, from
day one.. The layout of our data centre building lends itself very well to this as we can easily demarcate
our miners by coin, even down to individual bays. With planning permission already approved for a
second site, AX1 will build an additional structure that will also facilitate the above.

Appendix
The whole project has been designed from inception with scalability in mind. The target amount
to commence work on the second site in England is $10 million and when this amount is reached,
work will commence on the second site and funds deployed to fit out this custom built mining
centre. Planning permission has already been approved for the second site. If the crowdsale raises
more than can be deployed on these two sites, the issuer already has commitment for use of space
in an existing operation in Canada and is in discussion over precise terms - this will be operationally
integrated with, and controlled by, the base site in Manchester.

token’s value.
Summary
It is the considered view of the Executive Management team that the market place for cryptomining will be dominated
within a few years by large industrial operations where the barrier to entry for newcomers will be prohibitive - a
common feature of most developed business industries. The management team’s objective is to ensure that AX1 is at
the forefront of this anticipated oligopoly and that we are thereby able to secure value for our token holders.
