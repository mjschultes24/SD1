Be that as it may, online casinos are also a competitive and unpredictable
industry, driven by rising economic prosperity and social desire for entertainment.
However, to fully enjoy the platform and the online gambling experience, every
step of the game has to be transparent and inexpensive.
Up until the emergence of blockchain, a direct and fast exchange
of funds, along with indisputable
transparency and inability to tamper with the outcome of the games
were not possible in an online casino model. This fraudulent premise
is very often a sole and sufficient
argument against playing in an online casino - it is hard to prove that
a result is truly fair and without any
interference.
the recent years, the online gambling industry has been steadily
following an upward growth trend. In fact, the internet has become
a dominant gambling platform, even for casino chains which have been
present on the market for a while. It is a great time to be developing online,
dedicated platforms with opportunities for an international growth.

of new technological innovations,
a fair online casino model has

- entertainment.

Further expansion of this sector in
upcoming years will be driven by
increasing global financial prosperity, slacking of online gambling
regulations, but mostly through the
information technology development and seamless mobile broadband access around the world. With
the introduction of blockchain and
global online gambling industry has been steadily undergoing significant
growth over last couple of years. It was worth 41.77 billion USD in 2016,
followed by 47.11 billion USD in 2017 and is estimated to reach
59.79 billion USD by the end of 2020, at a CAGR of 10.8%1, which is 3
times faster than the global GDP. The projections for the global online
casinos show that between 2017-2025 the market will experience
a growth of about 130%, reaching 97 billion USD2.

TABLE OF CONTENT
Numerous online casinos are deliberately hiding data such as gaming
results, winnings or other financial
details from the public, thus making
it impossible to verify internal casino
mechanics.
Undisclosed way of choosing the
winner, mainly through random
number generator, accounts for inability to verify the fairness of the
games. To clarify - a process of random number generation is based
on two seed numbers (one from
the house, the other from the player) placed in an equation that provides a random number as a result.
However, before both unknowns are
substituted by the seed numbers,
there is a short time frame in which
the number provided by a client
can be uncovered allowing house
to choose one that will rig the bet.
If a player picks the seed number by
himself and leaves it unchanged for
the following games, a casino can
easily change its seed accordingly
in order to win the next bets. Also,
when a player decides for automatic
seed generation, it could actually be
generated intentionally by the casino.
urrently, online casinos struggle with users’ trust and loyalty. Why shouldn’t
they? There are many ways for an online casino to use unfair techniques in
order to increase its profits, mainly because all the calculations for online
casino games are done behind the stage, with no transparency whatsoever.
C

Problems
Another aspect of online gambling
with much room for improvement
are transactions. Withdrawal fees,
which could be as high as 9% in existing solutions, could be easily reduced, improving overall cost-effectiveness as a result. Daily withdrawal
limits imposed by casinos are also a
common practice. In addition, transaction processing time should be
even shorter than it is now. Besides
extra costs, standard payment methods take too much time to process,
in some cases up to 48 hours depending on the currency and service
provider. Even something seemingly simple - the process of deploying
a Visa or MasterCard payments - is
lengthy, complicated and involves
multiple intermediaries.
Besides the aforementioned shortcomings, there are other practices that online casinos use to drain
profits, even those based on Bitcoin blockchain. How? Well, even
though blockchain transactions are
fully transparent, it is not that easy
to figure out what each transaction
means and why they are carried out.
It is possible, for example, to manipulate the code of the game to make
one, specific wallet address a determined winner in every bet.

Moreover, thanks to an insight into these contracts, a doorway for disruptive profit
draining will be closed, as opposed to Bitcoin blockchain vulnerabilities. Being
able to verify every line of the code describing the set of rules for a given game
makes it impossible for casino to hide malpractices based on code manipulation
or other types of tampering.
When it comes to resolving an issue regarding transaction costs and their processing time, we have come up with a system and a set of solutions called simply
the Bitwin Network. This element of Bitwin ecosystem will not only allow us to
transfer just the final result of player’s wagers to the Ethereum blockchain, but also
enable near-instant payments with negligible transactional costs, even in case of
the lowest wagers.

efore blockchain-based solutions became available, online casinos
were just an alternative to the standard gambling establishments and
a convenient way of playing one’s favourite game without having to leave
the comforts of their home. No matter which option you chose, all the
unfriendly rules, like the large house edge and payout percentages,
still apply.
With the existence of blockchain in different forms, a new and better alternative
that fosters iGaming segment development is finally available.

Implementing blockchain technology in an online casino model solved the gambling price problem. Cost-effectiveness increased, resulting in a house edge as
low as 1%, whereas in land and normal online casinos that value could be as high
as 15%. Moreover, on-chain based casino eliminates the need for most of the costly intermediaries in the standard online casino, such as server hosting, service
providers or payment service processing, decreasing overall costs even further.
As a result, such financial perspective attracts more potential players and encourages online casino players to switch to blockchain based platforms.
What’s more, there is now a transparent way to run
a provably fair casino thanks to the auditable smart
contracts. That gives users an assurance of a fair
game, encouraging them to focus on entertainment
and still allowing a casino operator to profit.

The first and early Bitwin 1.0 platform, created prior to 2.0 version, was built with
the best standards in mind. Driven by clear and achievable vision, Bitwin dedicated all the resources at hand to design a visually sensational space that cannot be
challenged by any other gambling platform.
itwin was founded by a group of casino and sportsbook professionals
with years of vast experience originating from the gambling industry
who teamed up to create a distinctive and unique platform in the already
crowded iGaming space. Knowing that in order to become the platform
everyone looks up to, it has to remain competitive at every stage of the
challenge and at the same time offer the most attractive gaming
conditions and environment.

Graphical effort combined with a strong emphasis on a flawless user
journey led to the inception of a truly immersive, multisensory gaming
experience. As a result, Bitwin has created an online casino registered
under the Curacao Gaming license, with hundreds of ring-tested and
audited games running on 128-Bit SSL encryption, propped by another
crucial feature - random number generator tested in line with industry
standards.

So far, there is no prominent creator
of on-chain casino games. However,
we know how to gain that position
and become the NetEnt of blockchain gaming solutions. Our team
has gained immense knowledge
and experience in running an online
casino by years of working closely
with the leaders in the industry, such
as Yggdrasil or NetEnt.
This environment also allowed us
to gain detailed insight into the slot
games creation process. Bitwin team
is more than capable of providing the same, if not better, gaming
solutions - from the graphical point
of view, through technicalities, to a
complete, magical user experience.
itwin 2.0 will be a casino platform built on blockchain, with Bitwin Token
(BWT) at its heart. Our vision is to provide a truly transparent and provably
fair online casino experience with low transaction costs and instant
withdrawals of any amount. In order to accomplish that, we are building
on top of our current platform to adapt possibilities brought about with
blockchain technology. Bitwin 2.0 moves random number generation and
transactions to Ethereum network, while keeping the superb user
experience that our current users value so much.

of the main issues that trouble iGaming industry is transaction cost
efficiency, you either experience a long transfer time or a large fee for
withdrawing your funds. However, running transactions inside the platform
would not differentiate our platform from any other online casino.
That is why we came up with a novel solution to overcome that problem
and created Bitwin Network.

Bitwin Network
Bitwin Network is based on Raiden Network’s open source
project, providing a secure off-chain scaling solution.
Most important features are :
Sub-second confirmation time
Low-fees
Bi-directional payment channels
No fixed transactions per second limit
Payment routing
This allows us to create a payment mesh between players and casino, scaling upwards and downwards depending on the player
base. Only the final result of player’s wagers is being transferred to
the Ethereum blockchain, allowing Bitwin to decrease transactional
costs to negligible amount, even with the lowest wager amounts.
Among other benefits of Raiden Network implementation comes
sub-second confirmation time for transactions.
Making bi-directional payment channels a foundation of Bitwin Network allows for a first ever on-chain white label iGaming platform,
that is economically viable, provably fair and secure for the users,
since the casino never really holds any of their funds.
For the MVP phase, we prepared a solution based on Micro Raiden,
which is currently live on Ethereum Mainnet. There is a more robust
implementation of Bitwin Network under development, that we
plan to use to allow payment routing between all players enjoying
casino games at any given time.

thereum blockchain smart contracts, in their design, allow for carrying out
a pre-programed task in the exact same way every time they are called.
We wanted to take advantage of that and deploy a solution that is easily
verifiable, because fairness is currently one of the main concerns regarding
online casinos.
Considering these factors, we decided to use smart contracts to provide a provably fair random number generator. In order to generate random numbers, the
smart contract will be using repeated hashing function to generate a stream of
random numbers, as big as is required for the player to play the game seamlessly.
This solution allows anybody interested to verify the randomness by dehashing
last revealed hash output and comparing it to the outcome on Ethereum blockchain.
This method can be used not only in games such as slots, but also in a multi-player
games like Blackjack or Roulette. Each participants reveals his/hers hash function
output one at a time, thus generating one random number per round.

Figure 4. FansUnite sample Sportsbook layout.
The FansUnite Protocol (https://fansunite.com/) allows dApps such as the Bitwin
2.0 platform to leverage a decentralized network of incentivized oracles to supply
player and event data. These oracles are rewarded based on how accurately and
quickly they provide the requisite data. This network of incentivized data providers enables Bitwin 2.0 to resolve transactions requiring sports data to execute,
which includes sports betting, daily fantasy, or any other type of transaction that
needs sports data. As such, Bitwin will save on data feed costs through the oracle
network and will not require payment processor services by using the FansUnite
smart contracts, savings of which can be passed on directly to Bitwin users.

Ultimately, the FansUnite Protocol will significantly reduce the technical barrier

Inside the sportsbook platform all bets are placed using Bitwin Tokens and
resolved by a combination of smart contracts and oracles.
FansUnite provides a solution that is able to integrate with any ERC20 token and
their team will be involved in FansUnite Protocol roll-out of the Bitwin Platform.
We understand that sportsbook ecosystem needs time to grow, that is why we

our sportsbook. That is why we have created the Bitwin Vault, the primary
usage of tokens remaining in possession of the Bitwin Team.
Bitwin Vault will freeze BWT tokens for 6 month period after the launch of Sportsbook section. It will not be possible for Bitwin Team to use the tokens locked inside the Vault for any other purpose other than to wager and pay winnings to
players using our Sportsbook.
At the end of this period 50% of the frozen tokens will be unlocked to Bitwin’s
Team members. The sole purpose of the BWT tokens left in Bitwin Vault will be to
provide liquidity for Sportsbook. Our risk management team will set up wagers
with players until there is enough liquidity to enable participants to wager with

Considering the fact that the base platform of Bitwin 2.0 will be available to license
by other parties interested in running a blockchain based casino, autonomous
smart contracts will accumulate a percentage of winnings and make it available as
a first global, cross-operator blockchain jackpot.
However players should not be worried about Global Jackpot cutting into their
