MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                    2
1.i Highlights
This White Paper proposes the formation of a decentralized network of venture capital,
Blockchain development, publicly-traded and financial services companies packaged in
a unique and revolutionary structure which achieves the following for the first time
ever:
  We are connecting financial markets and Crypto markets with an operating model
that exists nowhere else in the world.
  Via structuring the primary vehicle in an offshore, tax efficient locale and utilizing a
unique private equity / hedge fund holding instrument with hybrid equity-issued /
non-incorporated status, Monkey Tokens cannot be used to undermine return
functions to investors nor can they in any way be classified as securities - and yet
from a risk standpoint, in our opinion they are safer than most traded shares
  We demonstrate how multiple Token issuances can create a cycle of perpetuated
digital asset creation for Token Holders as owners of MNY become eligible for free
Tokens pertaining to alternate same-portfolio asset ICOs managed by the same
decentralized group.
  We suggest a case study of how it may look to use an ICO for the purposes of raising
money for a hostile takeover of a large manufacturing company
  We illustrate how an investment in venture capital equity, opportunities by LOUD
Capital - in particular supply contracts with Elite Aerospace Group (Seed
Investment Target), who have customers such as Boeing, Embraer, and SpaceX -can
return Token investors up to 40% per year based on various mid and large cap
project contracts within the aerospace industry.
On balance, we feel that Monkey Capital’s unique MNY ICO is the first of many
innovative and game-changing value-additive issuances in the Token market.

PART I: INTRODUCING MONKEY CAPITAL




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                         7
1.0 OVERVIEW
1.1 What Is A Token?
Probably the most overlooked question in the field of digital assets todays is: ǲWhat is a
token? The main reason behind this is that seemingly there is a certain degree of
confluence of opposites here: specifically, less than one percent of the world knows exactly
what a token is, while 99% of the population has no idea. This dichotomy where such a
minor portion of the populace understands a form of value creation such an overwhelming
majority  has no idea about principles of leads to a lack of dialog regarding the most
fundamental of issues.
In this spirit, we want to open this White Paper establishing what it is that the paper itself
concerns. Otherwise, we would necessarily limit ourselves to a small confinement of the
world population that consists of insiders only, and that is not the approach Monkey
Capital is taking. The Monkey Capital model is an inclusive one, one which welcomes
newcomers as easily and readily as it does old hands. This is the way, after all, that we
intend to achieve our stated purposes (see Stated Purposes of Monkey Capital below).
In asking this question, we are simultaneously taking unprecedented pre-emptive legal
registration in the U.S.A under Rule 506(c)of Regulation D which means this offering (for
U.S. Residents) is only officially available to accredited investors (and US resident investors
will have to prove their accreditation before subscribing to this private offering.) And even
though we do not define this offering as a securities offering (Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act) we are taking the steps necessary in the event that that the SEC eventually
may, or does rule, that digital tokens are classified as securities. In fact we would like to be
the leaders in the industry and work with the regulators of the United States financial
exchanges to clearly define what a token is.  We wish to define what a token is and
implicitly, the reason for its existence.
First of all a token is not a share, nor is it a unit of spending power to be exact. It is not
money. It is rather a form of assigned digital value. In our case one of very specific value
assignment that marries digital asset value and real asset value creating a new, previously
undefined value. One we call the CoEval.
It is possible to have negative money and positive value, as anyone with margin on
securities or mortgages on property will be able to tell you. The same goes for digital
assets: while the holder may have bank loans or other unsecured debts in terms of their




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                          8
credit profile, they may also hold a large amount of value in the form of digital assets such
as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The reason someone might hold these two apparently
contradictory stances is clear: the holder believes that the value held will over time
appreciate at a significantly accelerated rate against the negative cash position assumed on
the other side of their personal balance sheet. Historically, this is a smart position to
assume. As examples from the stock markets have shown, over the long term, value trumps
money by an outstanding rate of increase.
A token, however, is not a security either, nor any other form of asset which has been made
readily available to a commercial investing public. The reason for this is that its attributes
are fundamentally different. To begin with, a token is a blank canvas when it comes to value
- you can paint on its face whatever picture you wish. A security, by contrast, has a very
fixed definition of value: specifically, it is a claim on the assets or earnings of an
incorporated entity. A token has no such restrictions in terms of value, and therefore, no
intrinsic value properties associated with it in the same way that conventional financial
assets do.
1.2 BLANK SHEET VALUE
The fact that there is no intrinsic value to a token is among the token’s strongest and
weakest characteristics. On the one hand, there is no basis for ǲsensibleǳ or ǲrationalǳ
valuation analysis. On the other hand however, because of the inherently unfixed
properties of its unitised value, there is a whole range of value attributes that can be built
into it, and virtually no limit as to the extent of depth or breadth of value that can be
applied, either.
This latter aspect to the token - that it is essentially a blank sheet - is what has drawn a
large majority of Millennial-generation individuals into the digital asset scene. Simply, for
over 20 years, inflation has been growing at a substantially higher rate than has wage
growth in most of the world. At the same time, the number of jobs available to the average
skilled worker has been falling. Combined with the effect of a much higher rise in education
relative to the previous population-heavy generation, the Baby Boomer’s; the Millennial
generation is one that is smarter, worse off financially and less in demand corporately than
any generation in history. The effect of this has been that upon leaving University, most
people today cannot afford to rent a condominium without some form of parental financial
assistance, let alone purchase their own, while they remain underpaid relative to their cost
of living, or simply unemployed, for long periods of time.
Naturally, a generation that harbours more intellectual ability and arguably, a much higher
ratio of creative and scientific talent than any that has come before, is not likely to willingly




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                      9
accept such a status quo before seeking solutions elsewhere. Thus, as increasing numbers
of digital assets followed the launch of Bitcoin in 2011, and digital forms of financing
became more possible via the introduction of crowdfunding, it was predominantly this
population that began to ascribe its own form of innovative, growth-oriented value to
concepts that are entirely foreign to all other generations that precede them.
1.3 UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF TOKENS
The reason that the concepts of value inherent in the token are foreign to almost everyone
except this core group of underpaid, overeducated talent is because the circumstances in
which this group finds itself are entirely unique. For despite more education, more creative
ability and access to much more efficient and intelligent scientific resources than any other
population in history, most find themselves in financial difficulty and lacking in demand of
commercial opportunity or employment on a regular basis.
The token is the population’s response to such circumstances: it is the blank canvas upon
which creative, technological and educated classes - whatever their financial or local social
status may be - drew themselves towards in finding a new form of value.
Naturally, the token, being the response to this generation’s social circumstances, is one
which addresses the immediate requirements that such circumstances might entail.
Specifically:
   It generates significant returns over comparatively very short periods of time via
harnessing the combined properties of all value configurations, and by being
essentially a network device that continues to harness those properties perpetually.
This fact enables large numbers of Millennial participants to join without
endangering the chances of others’ success. This is unlike a housing or share market
which due to the limitation of its rules and structural constraints, quickly overheats.
   Trading operates 24-hours a day, and does not favour one geography or region.
While today this is a relatively obvious concept, it is only so for Millennial
generation participants - trading is considered work by most other generations, and
as such, not for the evening. This antiquated definition of work began disappearing
as companies stopped providing the same level of commitment and loyalty to the
individuals they employed.
   Value and functionality are flexible and easily built into a token, with multiple
technological adaptions made possible. Partly due to this, the token is a unit that can
be passed freely over borders in digital format, an essential characteristic for a
generation that is largely interconnected by focus group, interest and/or physical

separation due to life circumstances (vs. person preference) in a virtual
environment.
2.0 ABOUT MONKEY CAPITAL
Monkey Capital is a Value CoEval. A Value CoEval is a collective non-incorporated entity
which is represented by two or more independent parties which agree to sell a minority
stake in their respective incorporated entities to the management company of the projects
they undertake to invest in together and which is managed exclusively for the purpose of
generating their own private capital returns (the financial markets equivalent of a
Decentralised Autonomous Organisation).
The difference between a DAO and a Value CoEval is principally the following:
   A DAO is an innovation and/or technology- focused group while a Value CoEval is an
investment-focused group real world bridge.
   A DAO is a legally-ambiguous term whereas a Value CoEval is an unincorporated
Joint Venture Partnership Agreement between different parties utilizing a
Partnership structure as a mechanism to combine.
   A DAO has no explicit mandate to protect investors’ money whereas a Value CoEval
by definition of its status as a configuration agent of value must take steps to do so.
2.1  VALUE COEVAL MEMBERS
The parties forming the Monkey Capital Value CoEval are:
1)  DMH&CO(Singapore)
2)  Monkey Capital LLC (Cayman)
3)  Monkey Ventures (DDF) (Austria)
4)  Monkey Investments LLC (USA)
5)  Monkey Capital LP (Lux)
6)  LOUD Capital(USA)
7)  Highway Capital Plc(UK)
8)  The Factory Banking Company(Singapore)
2.2 OUR MISSION
Monkey Capital’s mission is two-fold:




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                  11
1)  It is to further this value propagation process described herein and to bring it to a
wider number of people.
2)  It is to connect this value propagation process with the conventional financial
landscape and hence to integrate it into the mainstay of the wider economy.
2.3 PRODUCT VARIETY - F-TYPE TOKENS
A Value CoEval can be considered a process as much as a structure. When operating as a
process, it is depicted by three aspects, referred to as Token Families:
1)  Embryo Token: This is an F0 token issued by the Maternal Issuer - the engagement
force of the Value CoEval. This token is placed on the market prior to the Initial Coin
Offering (ICO) where it is traded prior to ICO, in order to establish pre-market
liquidity in the project. The Embryo Token also serves as a useful marketing agent
for the ICO itself. This is the backbone of the Tokens.
2)  Parent Token: The F1 Parent Token is a token that is emitted via the Embryo Token
at the point of ICO. It carries inside it multiple other tokens that are emitted at their
respective point of ICO. These tokens are called Child Tokens.
3)  Fʹ Child Tokens are specific aspects of the portfolio underlying the Parent Token’s
main portfolio, which in turn are built on real world businesses, equity, etc. The rate
between which a portfolio’s income payouts, (distributions) are divided between
the Parent-Child relationships, is referred to as Favouritism. For example, if an F1
Parent receives 30% less income from Child Token ͳ’s portfolio and ͺͲ% more of
income from Child Token ʹ’s portfolio, the Parent Token has 50% Favouritism for
Token 2 (see Part 3).

at varying rates. *example: Digital Developers Fund @ 26%.
2.  F3 Token- Cousin Tokens; pay into MNY at rates not less than 30% on a variable
basis.
3.0 Pre-ICO Sales
3.1 Discounted Token Purchases
Monkey Capital has not yet offered an official presale of tokens. There have been various
discounted offers for MNY discussed with certain individual parties for early and/or
substantial entry level purchases, but the official line of the organisation remains that there
exist no such offers. This is because we consider our offering to be superior in class to any
other ICO to date to the extent that such offers are not required to bring in large amounts of
capital.
3.2 COEVAL & Discounted MNY Distributions
While there are no discounted offerings officially offered, there is an Embryo Token that
DMH&CO, Monkey Capital’s original founding entity, has offered to investors in the Value
CoEvals upcoming ICO. The Embryo Token in question is called COEVAL.
COEVAL offers 10,000 MNY for every 1 COEVAL held at the point of ICO. The distributions
will be made direct to the Waves Wallets using as a guide the active (i.e. non-locked,
unburned) COEVAL holding wallets at four hours from 11.59pm UCT on 9/9/17 in phased
distribution over a period of 7 days. Recipients of MNY Tokens may retain possession of
COEVAL even after receiving the MNY tokens in their wallets, and are free to trade them on
the exchanges offered at the time of distribution and throughout the ICO process.
3.͵ COEVAL’s Status as Core Digital Base Value of Monkey Capital Value CoEval
Value CoEvals should have their own Digital Base Value via which all distributions,
incentives, payouts etc. to token holders are made and through which all Crypto
transactions officially take place. For Monkey Capital, this DBV is COEVAL.
COEVAL will be the DBV via which all distributions are paid out to token holders by
Monkey Capital Pte. Ltd. This enables Monkey Capital to plausibly concede that
distributions are not being transferred directly to token holders, but rather being
employed to repurchase more tokens in the market, the sum of which are redistributed on
a pro-rata basis in exactly the same way that MNY is first distributed to holders of COEVAL.




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                         13
There are several advantages here. The first advantage with such purchase and distribution
activities is that as the organisation grows in size, so the distribution sizes should increase.
As a result, the amount of COEVAL that Monkey Capital will be required to repurchase off
the exchanges will increase, further bolstering the value of COEVAL.
The second advantage is: while there can only be a fixed number of token offerings, which
cannot dilute, dilution options in                                                                 order to raise cash or purchase
businesses for the LP can be                                                                       carried out via the public company’s
issuance of new shares. In                                                                         effect, token holders benefit from

the same time suffering no such                                                                    effects themselves. In our view, this is
likely to make many shareholders                                                                   of the public company stock

3.4 Markets of Perfect Cooperation
When decentralization takes place, at first there is a scramble for control and as such,
extreme competitive behavior. But after that, where it used to be competitiveness -a sort of
willful cooperation emerges among autonomous parties as the realization sets in that
things will not change much without a free-flow of dialog, ideas, and ultimately, action.
Therefore, the key effect of decentralization is the encouragement of willful cooperation
(perfect cooperation) in place of forced cooperation (imperfect competition). The problem
with centralization is not that it enhances control, since - control is an essential aspect of
any sort of operating reality. It is that by the implication of forcing a cooperative paradigm
upon a body of operations, objectives become skewered in the madness of imperfect
competition.
In reality, centralization never allows for a market of perfect competition. For, if perfect
competition was allowed to flourish, without the undue authoritarian influence of forced
cooperation presiding over the corpus laborus  then it would put its own power and
control at stake. This dichotomy is felt in many supposedly democratized environments
today, where despite the supposed right to elect and freely participate as an equal player at
a financial, political or even purely social event, forced cooperation erodes the natural
competition supposedly inherent in the democratic framework in which we are
participating.
Until recently, this less-than-adequate response to democratic institutionalization has been
left aside as one of the inherently unfixable hypocrisies of the system. But in an economic
context, this is beginning to change. The development of the Blockchain, an independent
autonomous, mutually-assured internet protocol that combines the value constructs of a
value chain, a value shop and a value network all in one, has brought decentralization for
once into view as a potentially realistic solution to eradicate the forced cooperation
dilemma.
Still, proponents of decentralization focus on the removal of authority as the key shift in
emphasis. While certainly a notable shift, the removal of control is not a sincere shift, since
control is never removed, but rather supplanted elsewhere. What is much more important
is the potential then for markets of Perfect Cooperation to evolve so that in turn,
decentralization can harness minority (individual) authority and action.




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                    15
3.5 How Monkey Capital Applies The Cooperation Advantage
By simultaneously employing both centralized (public company) and structurally
decentralized (LP / Tokens) architecture in its overall construct of operations, Monkey
Capital achieves the fundamental benefit of decentralist application -cooperative operating
harmony - while nevertheless having a binding control force on the top floor in the form of
a Cayman LLC.
It is not just the tax advantages of locales such as Cayman, Luxembourg and Singapore
which drew us to these destinations, but the lack of requirements for burdensome and
cumbersome filling out and filing of forms and other legal procedure. Robust structures
make for better up-times and easier downtimes. Monkey Capital’s mix of public-private,
share-token, asset-earnings driven growth, shares all the key strengths of a 21st century
organization in a new way the likes of which have never been witnessed before.
3.6 Top 10 Holders - COEVAL Distribution
Monkey Capital is aware of the holders of 62% of all COEVAL. Total percentage of tokens in
circulation is 49% of those at issuance, representing roughly 490m MNY tokens. COEVAL
has an issuance value of 0.1 BTC. The Entire Management of Monkey Capital collectively
agrees to halt any market or on-exchange sales of tokens from the stated accounts above
until end of the ICO period.

PART 2: DIGITAL & FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                               17
1.0  THE DIGITAL ASSET MARKET
1.0.1   PRODUCT OVERVIEW
Since the development and launch of Ethereum and ERC-20 compliant tokens, over $600m have
been raised from Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Investors have noticed broad-based returns of 5-10x
capital invested.
However, contrary to contemporary perception among new entrants to the digital asset market,
this trend in successful, widely-crowdfunded ICOs is not confined to Ethereum’s network protocol.
There were ICOs before Ethereum even existed, that took place on the Omni protocol, the
Counterparty protocol. The NXT asset exchange has been very active; up until 2014 Peershares also
featured successful ICOs (NuShares and B&C exchange).
In fact, when considered in the context of recent history and of the overarching development
timeline of the Blockchain more generally, the events of 2017 really amount to a second wave of
ICO popularity that came to a halt temporarily during an aberration in the digital currency market
from 2014-2016 after Bitcoin’s market value dropped about ͹Ͳ% or so.
Up until 2014, NXT was spearheading the ICO market, with hosted issuances totalling more than
$150m worth of tokens on what amounted to around $80m worth of NXT digital currency. To put
things in perspective, this was at a time when Bitcoin was just $500.
As a consequence of these and other factors (such as what we understand to be the natural
exponential evolution of token utility among online users), we do not immediately associate ICO
popularity with Ethereum’s protocol novelty, despite the ETH price increases being at least
superficially ascribable to a certain renewed enthusiasm for digital assets.
Rather, we understand this latest wave of popularity in the token market as a more fundamental
search effort for sustainable platform evolution and best-execution capability of the underlying
technology being engaged in the process of the listing and wider utility and reliability of the
functionality of the token as its own sui-generis asset class. It is chiefly with this purpose in mind
that we decided to focus the experience of our team now on this subject and undertake our own
ICO. Quite simply, we feel strongly that we can contribute to and greatly enhance the next-stage
evolution of token issuance as its own multi-purpose asset class.
Despite the strength in the token market, offerings remain thin on management experience,
business strategy and detailed execution timelines. In many cases, big-picture proclamations (e.g.
ǲwe want to be the world’s first decentralised bankǳሻ remain the status quo sales pitch.
Specifically, although smart contracts enable the payment of dividends, this feature appears yet
unusable for the foreseeable future as most of the token offerings centre around early-stage




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                               18
venture capital raises. Further, the instability of the Ethereum network remains a troubling
consideration for investment management companies that are responsible for the management of
money belonging to investors.
The lack of sophistication among ICO applicants combined with the network instability of the
Ethereum platform and the simultaneous propagation of alternate Token platforms such as Waves
along with the unique technological and financial expertise of the Monkey Capital team opens up a
substantial opportunity for market dominance in the Blockchain sphere.
At the present moment there is an opportunity to offer tokens on the market over the forthcoming
years that are not only benefitted by the rampant growth of the digital asset market as a whole, but
furthermore by the current performance of the assets underlying cash flow positive supported ICO
issuances.
1.0.2   KEY ADVANTAGES  FOR  MONKEY  CAPITAL
The digital assets market is perfectly poised for a timely dominant positioning and rapid expansion
oversight. Monkey Capital is a first-of-its-kind financial services and Blockchain development
company, being as it is a merged entity between a private investment company and a vintage
Blockchain / Exchange developer. Specifically the company counts among its core strengths:
   Professional financial team with over 40 years of structuring, syndicating and originating
high margin capital markets transactions
   Highly-skilled and best-of-breed technology development team with excellent
understanding of practical financial application of Blockchain technology
   Access to high-quality assets at deep discounts and/or zero-sum purchase values enabling
high-margin securitisation (e.g. Highway Capital call options)
   Knowledge of IPO, RTO and M&A transactions, enabling quick value production for token
holders
   Unique, value-generative investment products that can be quickly assembled, sold and
securely maintained by in-house tech development team.
1.1 MONKEY (MNY) PROPRIETARY INVESTMENTS
In addition to making investments in spin-off ICOs (like the acquisition of Digital Developers Fund
finalised on Aug 26), the objective of utilization of a part of the funds is specifically to build the
value of the organisations forming the Value Coeval.
In particular, we have identified significant value opportunities in terms of making a proprietary
investment in LOUD Capital, which has direct access through seed investments in Elite Aerospace to
invest in Space X contracts, Embraer and Boeing. The Monkey Capital team has developed a robust
timeline of ICO’s over the next ͳʹ months that directly coincide with major Infrastructure and




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                             19
Energy project throughout Africa. For example Monkey Capital through it’s affiliation with a major
US DOD contractor has access right of first bid on UN, IMF and World Bank Funded Development
projects. The management at Monkey Capital have the right market positioning, expertise and team
to penetrate the Asia-Pacific and China markets in Blockchain infrastructure systems for banks and
digitally issued state currencies. Highway Capital PLC, where an immediate value uplift opportunity
exists. We have scheduled for early December the EVM Evareium ICO,  the first ever blockchain
linked Real Estate Equity Management company based in Dubai, expecting to hold $100 Million in
managed assets in the first year of operation which will then be exited into a DIFC licensed REIT.
There are also valuable trading opportunities that we will continue to develop within our Token
infrastructure system that will lead to licensed managed trading accounts capitalizing on market
movement between our Tokens, BitCoin, Ethereum, XRP and others. We are already in talks with
several exchanges about a MA opportunities as well as starting new location specific platforms built
on yet the massively unexploited arbitrage within crypto-currencies and digital tokens that is
already a very serious and growing source of revenue.
MNY token holders will therefore benefit from the following:
  Upcoming ICOs held by Monkey Capital and the investments underlying them, some of which
are detailed in this White Paper
  Returns on investments in the actual managers and parties hosting the ICOs which will sell a
portion of convertible debt as outlined in this White Paper for income and capital gains share
to the limited partnership structure feeding the Token value
  A diversified and simultaneously Blockchain-linked growth trajectory which promises to
enhance value underlying the Tokens over the long term
  Returns on investments in flourishing Blockchain networks which are not specifically detailed
in this paper due to proprietary information (competitive purposes)
  An internally and externally management-audited and custody-enhanced value creation
process designed exclusively with the Token Holder (i.e. not just the project itself) in mind
  Returns from Contracts and Revenue share from our Investments in LOUD Capital
  Returns from Contracts and Revenue share from Infrastructure, Development and Capital
Projects
  Returns and revenue from the Real Estate Equity Management company Evarei and its Token
distributions




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                                20
2.0 ABOUT MNY TOKENS
Multi-token issuance was selected as a strategy for the  management of the projects proposed by
the Value CoEval members to counter the inherent economic disincentive of the B-shareholders to
pass on portions of their future gains in such projects to the Token Holders.
In respect of the mutual consent of the separate parties forming the Value CoEval known as Monkey
Capital, specifically in order to accommodate additional crowdfunding subscriptions assigned to the
LP, MNY is made available as potential units of value linked to the success of projects managed
within MCLP.
2.1 DISTRIBUTION PAYOUT DILLEMMA WITHIN ICOs TODAY
In previous ICOs during 2017, we have noticed how glaringly conflicted the interests of the
investing parties and the management parties are, wherein Tokens are distributed with a patent
disregard for this conflict of interest that exists between the two.
Specifically, management teams of the project beneficiaries related to the Token Holders’
investments are purely incentivised to raise money for long-term hard to value projects and to
leave out distribution payouts as an afterthought, or to retain as large a share of the distribution
payouts for themselves as possible due to the structurally ambiguous status of the Tokens.
In practice, although distributions might be proposed in an ICO White Paper, the legal reality is that
Token Holders have little claim on project returns from such investments and the Tokens are
therefore little more than a best-guess at not just which project manager is more able to generate
returns, but also more likely to do so if and when such returns materialize.
At best, return possibilities are on a ǲfrom time to timeǳ basis, and are subject to the mutual consent
of the shareholders of the project management entity, to where collectively 100% of the gains of the
project are at first ascribed.
MNY Token Holders share in much more assuredness of returns via the possibility of receiving
financial returns subject to the financial incentive and legal status of the General Partner of the
Value CoEval.
2.2 MONKEY CAPITAL’S MULTI-TOKEN ISSUANCE COEVAL SOLUTION




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                                21
Because MNY Tokens represent a permissible - but not legally enforceable or in any way
mandatory - claim on the potential gains paid out by MCLP, there is a clear conflict of interest vis-à-
vis the Value Coeval members’ interest in funding projects which they profit from vs. those of the
buyers of MNY Tokens at the ICO.
This conflict is resolved by separating the voting and the distribution shares out between two
parties in an LP structure, as is possible under Luxembourg incorporation law. For despite its legal
status as an unincorporated entity, the Lux LP is denominated in shares due to the affordance of
such structures under the Luxembourg law.
In accordance with the Luxembourg law, the GP and LP have a private General Partnership
Agreement (GPA), where the Agreement stipulates that the General Partner of the LP will be paid
out in percentage terms 1/20th of AUM annually of whatever percentile-equivalent of the
distributions received by the B-shareholders is waved by the B-shareholders in lieu of the Token
Holders.
In other words, if the Token Holders receive 100% of the distributions, then the General Partner
will receive 5% AUM. Since the General Partner is project-agnostic and is not a B-shareholder, but
instead a 100% A-shareholder, the GP is not incentivised to maintain any of the distributions within
the B-shareholding at all. Rather, the GP is incentivised directly to enhance the returns received by
the Token Holders, or he gets paid less.
MNY as a base digital token
2.3 RESULTANT LONG-TERM VALUE CREATION FOR MNY TOKEN HOLDERS
As a result of the formation of a decentralised Value CoEval in the Monkey (MNY) ICO, and as a
consequence of the segregation of project funding compartmentally into further individual Token-
related Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) structures similar to the MNY SPV structure, we have created
a resolution to this dichotomy.
The only way in which the General and Limited Partners of the project can hope to realize
consistent income share is if the Token Holders do as well.
Further, by virtue of owning 100% of the A-shares of the LP, the GP is the only party capable of
making the dividend waiver decision in favour of the Token Holders anyway, despite the income
shares being entirely owned by the other members of the CoEval.
This is because the question of where the distributions are paid out is one that is fundamentally a
voting issue, not one that is in itself an income issue, despite the nature of the issue concerned.
The constant receipt of 100% of distributions by the Token Holders at all times gives the MNY
Tokens an implicit - though still not legally-binding, and therefore, a non-equity status - intrinsic




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                                                            22
value measurement which over time will greatly enhance the durability of MNY Token value as
more ICOs are undertaken.
We feel this long-term value durability of the Token will greatly enhance its status as a utilisable
value proposition on what is a network of multifarious exchanges and niche pools of liquidity with
variable price premium mechanics, especially as hype surrounding the digital asset
LOUD
sector saturates the market return aspect of Token purchase activity.

Fig  1: Monkey Capital’s Value CoEval  - In the diagram above, the Value CoEval members receive income  derived from
the  benefits  of  payouts  made  via  Token  payments  which  are  held  in  Trust  by  Monkey  Capital  Pte.  Ltd.  Projects  are
managed  by  the  responsible  members  of  the  Value  CoEval,  while  capital  is  managed  via  a  decentralised  independent
way via The Factory Banking Company. Unlike the other members of the Value  CoEval, The Factory Banking Company is
compensated on a fixed-return basis expressed as a  percentage of AUM tied to the percentage of income received by
the  Token  Holders.  Therefore,  the  scenario  is  one  in  which  distributions  are  constantly  deferred  to  Token
Holders, whereby Monkey Capital Pte. Ltd, receives  a share of  20% of all distributions which it divides among the
members  of  the  CoEval  according  to  private  agreement.  In  order  to  assure  mutual  performance  standards  are
continually upheld and are done suitably diversified in the interests of MNY Token Holders  (and are  therefore not
tied  solely  to  the  activities  of  a  single  project  manager),  multiple  projects  pay  out  various  dividends  via
separately-issued Tokens in the multi-ICO process.

2.4 BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK CHOICE: WAVES
Monkey Capital has initially selected Waves as the platform of choice for its immediate multi-token
issuance strategy mostly due to security and stability factors, as well as the supreme integration of
the Waves platform. Waves approach to tokens gives more focus on the stability and security of the
system than features. Ethereum is very flexible in what it can do, due to Turing-completeness of its
smart contract system. However this also makes its attack surface essentially unlimited and
constantly exposed to threats and attacks. We appreciate Waves’ approach to the matter, where
functionality is theoretically limited but still delivers all the desired functionality.
The long term goal is to build a robust blockchain infrastructure that has functionality like Waves
but built specifically and exclusively for the Monkey Capital Ecosystem.
Specifically, arbitrary code execution surface attack is not possible with Waves, which makes the
system much safer than Ethereum. As seasoned investors we prefer stability over flexibility,
especially when big money is at stake. We also appreciate how integrated the Waves ecosystem is,
with fiat gateways and decentralized token markets.
Due to our status as a combined group of established firms that are all profitable in their own right,
the reputational risk of possible attack on the Ethereum network is simply too great a risk to run
for us. In summary, Monkey Capital would make itself a target for manipulation, theft and
ultimately, substantial reputation damage by employing the use of an ERC20-compliant smart
token. Waves solution mitigates such risks.

2.5 DELIBERATE TOKEN HOLDER-BIASED STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO
The Monkey Capital portfolio is a single individual portfolio (fund) managed by The Factory
Banking Company Pte. Ltd., a Singapore-based management and investment consulting firm, for
and on behalf of Monkey Capital Pte. Ltd.
The portfolio is managed by one third party for another third party, which is normally a
registration requirement in both Singapore and in Luxembourg where the fund is based (Monkey
Capital LP). However, by virtue of the status of both entities as a majority subsidiary holding of
Daniel Mark Harrison & Co. Pte. Ltd. (DMH&CO), a Singapore-based Family Office, the structure falls
outside the requirement for registration with either Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)
and/or with the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), since it is evident that
DMH&CO is managing money on its own behalf, a privilege afforded it without any reporting
requirement as a private Family Office.

   The assets underlying the token issuance include but are not limited to the following:
  DMH&CO’s stake in Highway Capital ሺinvested into the SPV by DMH&COሻ
  a stake in SVS Securities PLC which will ultimately be sold to Highway prior to
Highway re-listing on the LSE (thereby giving the SPV an enlarged equity
position in a listed financial services company with multiple synergies with
Monkey Capital);
  revenues derived from asset management partnerships with regulated AMs
  underlying assets which are securitised via a holding in the sub-LP
   LP cash raised from the Token issuance will be used to fund the assets purchase and
structuring as outlined above in addition to co-establishing a digital currency trading fund
   As a consequence of performing these tasks, Monkey Capital will successfully bring to the
market:
  the first token with earnings-, assets- and investment returns-backed distributions
  with discounted value features for VCs in the management / parent entity

  Monkey Capital is the first Blockchain development company to effectively synergize equity,
revenue, share value, and token issuance
5.0   PROJECTED FINANCIALS
Monkey Capital will have three core sources of earnings:
  The issuance and sale of digital tokens backed by assets(IP, patents, real estate), revenue,
equity, dividends from shares in a public company and
  The trading of assets with digital asset values into portfolios belonging to the SPVs which
underwrite the token issuances
  Consulting
For FY17, Monkey Capital expects to launch 3 direct tokens, and one cousin token(ICOs) and has
already acquired 1 Step Child token. Cash fees for the combined issuances are expected to amount
to $2.5m upfront, assuming a total $50m raise, with consulting and SPV management fees coming to
an additional $1.3m. With approximately 15% of all tokens withheld by Monkey Capital, the
company will earn an extra $6.25m in token value at issuance. The average performance of ICOs
throughout 2017 has been 500%; if this is the case across the 3 primary token issuances planned
then Monkey Capital will earn an additional $25m in increased proprietary token sales and trading
revenue for a total of $32.5m in proprietary token sales and trading revenue.
Additionally, there are revenues expected for Blockchain (technology) consulting contracts which
will amount to $300,000 (in line with historical average for Digital Developers Fund) and income
gained from selling assets at a mark-up (held under DMH&CO into the SPVs which underwrite
token issuances). We have estimated the mark-up only for sales of SVS Securities PLC stock and
Highway Capital PLC call options, both of which are owned currently by DMH&CO. The mark-up
income will amount to $6.637m.




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                               28
40% of revenue from investment into LOUD Capital will be delivered back to MNY holders (the
specific number are deliberately withheld due to contract clause with Space X.)
With equity mark-ups included, Monkey Capital conservatively expects to earn $16.387m during
the financial year of 2017 on a relatively conservative cost basis, with burn rate factoring in around
$200,000 a month.
*Projected revenues from other investments are on a case by case basis, and will be individually
identified and delineated in subsequent individual project prospectus.  Net revenues distributed to
Token holders will be done on a bi-annual basis, and are targeted at a minimum rate of 25% of net
revenue per project for the first year (allowing for reinvestment and expansion) up to a maximum
of 75% of net revenue as early as year five.
6.0   VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO
The portfolio of Private Tokens (PVT) will be kick-started with an injection of the following
diverse range of top-tier venture capital investments by LOUD Capital over the previous 3+
years.

Via a successful seed stage investment it made with Elite Aerospace, LOUD Capital brings the
opportunity to invest into a supply contract with parts-supplier Elite Aerospace Group. Elite
Aerospace will undertake an IPO in the next 2-3 years. Before that point, there exists an investment
opportunity, in buying shares of Elite Aerospace for $2 a share, with current value at $5 a share.
Based on Net Present Value, that is a return of over 30% per year for the duration of the period
until IPO. The funds will be used to purchase supply equipment for manufacturing to fulfil contract
orders from Boeing, Embraer, SpaceX, and many other suppliers to aviation and aerospace
companies.

7.0   CASE STUDY OF A HOSTILE TAKEOVER OPPORTUNITY
Because of their inherently decentralized status, tokens make for the ideal source of
funding for hostile takeovers of poorly-managed companies with high Capex and low re-
investment in R&D.  In 2015, DMH&CO analyzed a potential target whereupon the
quantitative data in the present day is almost identical. A Token that acted in the form of a
Token Note would be a potentially effective way to finance the cornerstone of such a
purchase.
The following is a summary of a case study of how such a decentralized Token-enabled
hostile takeover would work. Essentially, a Token with Bond-style attributes would be
issued; we call this Token a Token Note (NOTE). Token Notes would pay a fixed rate of
return and a variable rate of return based on the performance of the underlying
investments.

BAIN & CO. ǲACQUISITION STRESS TESTǳ
Bain & Co., the private equity firm, suggests applying five key questions/headline points to
all acquisitions. These points are in bold and the answers in normal typeface.
   Capture the ǲquick hitsǳ - early gains make all the difference
Instantly free up cashflow and deploy to CapEx in markets such as India where the firm has
lost all its market share. At $200m+ in revenue, this market represents too much lost
business to leave alone.
   Develop a multiyear strategy to change the business
i)                                                                                              A focus not just on printing and security solutions products, but leveraging the brand
name and its strong ties to printing cash products in order to enter financial services
ሺeither via buying existing brokers or starting them upሻ to create a ǲGoldman Sachs of
Asiaǳ.
ii)                                                                                             A focus on updating and staying ahead of crucial printing technologies, buying mid-
stage 3D printers and investing in R&D so that when the time comes, the company is
ahead of the rest in terms of innovation there.
   Roll-out robust value creation program in Year 1
By instantly freeing up $220 million of cashflow and reinvesting in the above opportunities,
in addition to consolidating all debt into one, easily-payable Token Note issuance, the

financial costs of the business will go down about 5.5x in total. This leaves excess capital to
reinvest in existing plants and factories and bolster the balance sheet further, as opposed to
sitting on and repurchasing stock that is declining in value.
   Focus on talent and build high-performance organizations
A proper global HR strategy needs to be put in place, focused on the individual, whatever
hierarchy he/she might fall under in the organization. Among manufacturers generally,
there is still almost zero use of smart, keen, hard-working talent on the ground in Asian
factories etc. There needs to be a fast-track identification process to speed the ǲbrightest
and the best’ whoever and wherever they may be, directly to the top floor.
   Turn good ideas into great ones
Having an organization that participates in security products that are hard to forge and
costly and difficult to design is a good way to have a monopoly market share. But an even
better way is to become a mainstay in the culture where you are placed. The company
prints money and currency, and is involved in operating and innovating some of the most
sophisticated technologies in the world. There should be room for two different strands of
the organization to develop: finance and technology. In addition, the firm should return to
its third traditional focus: media. By organizing the organization thus, slowly it becomes
invulnerable to potential harm done to revenue streams as the society transitions to
cashless, credit card free payment systems. In fact, in such a case, it’s already the one
making the cashless payment systems and value networks on the
same principles and same technology that was making stamps at the turn of the 20th
century.

MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                     33
7.1.1   INCOME STATEMENT
Gross profit has declined by a total of 73% since 2012 on 24% in declines of sales in the
same period while operating expenses have remained more or less the same (about a 10%
decline). Clearly, such a huge reduction in profit on what is a bad, but manageable, decline
in sales implies that somewhere extra cash is being eaten up although it is not obvious from
the income statement where that area is.
7.1.2   BALANCE SHEET
Balance sheet items are kept almost at standstill for the most part since 2011, implying no
great investment in equipment, plants, assets, projects etc.
This is confirmed by the swelling in retained earnings. Retained earnings ate the earnings
of the company that are not accounted for in operating costs because they are used to pay
dividends to shareholders and for stock repurchases.
In this case they have increased 11,700% in 5 years, to a loss of GBX 139 million in 2015.
This is where the majority of the offset in earnings is being consumed.
Thus, assuming that such costs were controlled, there is an estimated GBX 60 million - 100
million in potential annual cash flow that could be used to service debt repayment costs as
well as to invest in rebuilding the company if the company is taken private. This easily
meets the financing plan laid out via the 13% dividend-paying Token Note outlined on the
separate excel and summary.
7.1.3   INCOME & ASSETS
A glance at the ratios between Revenue, Operating Income, Capital Expenditure
(Investment) and Dividend Payments also reveals hidden cash flow that is being used to
stabilize financing concerns rather than act as business reinvestment.
While Revenue/Operating Income and Revenue/Capital Spend Deviation (Variation) Ratios
are relatively low (correlated) at 1.4 and 5.8 respectively, Revenue/Dividend, Operating
Income/Dividend and Capital Spend Variation/Dividend ratios are 923, 630 and 157,
respectively. In other words, there is no correlation between income, earning and
expenditure fluctuations and the consistency in which dividends are being paid to
shareholders or financing costs are being met.




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                     34
This is further supported by the fact that in the past 5 years, Book Value/Share has
declined an average of 178% per year while retained earnings losses have increased a
remarkably similar average of 155% per year.
7.1.4   CASH FLOW STATEMENT
The Cash Flow Statement provides yet more corroboration for the estimation of GBX 60
million - 100 million in cash that is annually locked up in stock repurchase schemes and in
dividend payouts, with a cumulative GBX 430 million used for these activities since 2011
and in the year-to-date period combined. De La Rue claims that costs related to the foreign
exchange competitiveness of overseas firms have hampered its annual profitability, but this
is simply not true: such costs are a fraction (around 5%) of the costs that are incurred in
financing activities.
7.1.5   TOKEN NOTE ISSUANCE
The Token Note issuance laid out on the alternate XLS and Summary allocates an amount
between GBX 33 million - GBX 50 million in principle repayments and dividends (as part of
the shareholder offer) for the first six years, allocating an approximate minimum of GBX
250 million for Capital Reinvestment during that time frame.
Gradually, over the next decade, this amount increases to an eventual final year payment of
GBX 119 million, which is similar to what the company spends today in financing
shareholder dividend payouts and stock repurchases.
By Year 15, the company will have made an approximate minimum of GBX 1 billion in
additional capital expenditure (reinvestment) payments, generating annual cumulative
returns, a portion of which are paid out as a dividend to the investors taking up the buyout
offer.
The high real interest rate of around 8.5% per year is easily serviceable in one lump
One lump sum payment at the end of the term of the Token Note under such conditions
(and high enough to be refinanced easily at a lower cost if necessary).
7.2                                                                                            PRICE SUMMARY
Price is currently 5% below analyst target consensus for 2015 and just 9.6% over the 52-
week low with a 34% discount to the year high. On Oct 25-Nov 7 the stock will move to a
new 5-year low, thus the opportune moment to make a bid for the company is sometime in




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                     35
Sept before the value becomes momentum-bound and while uncertainty over
management’s new objectives is still prevalent.
The high-low gap on the stock on a 52-week basis right now is around 6:1, but as this gap
closes beyond 3:1 any offer loses exponential appeal to shareholders beyond that point.
Thus there is a very short timeline in which to make a bid and get shareholder approval for
buy-out of the company.
7.3                                                                                            OFFER OUTLINE/PROPOSED ACQUISITION SPECIFICS
Offers have been made for De La Rue, mostly from privately-owned competitors in Europe;
these offers have all been rejected by the company’s management.
Once rejected, the offers were not pursued in a hostile fashion. Offers were made in the
750p-950p per share region, variously from 2004 right up to 2015 in January.
A hostile offer that is likely to succeed would look like the following: Consideration per
share: 820p Earnings multiple (gross): 25x. Term of dividend payments: 15 years Min.
Dividend of applied multiple: 1.28%
Thus, in the current scenario, investors would receive a total consideration of GBX 830.66
($1,287m) upfront, representing a per share premium over the 52-week target of 58%.
Factoring in the dividend payment, the offer stands at a premium of 85% to the 52-week
target and is a healthy 25% higher than the 52-week peak, not including the possibility that
the dividend may be reinvested.
In order to purchase the company, the best possible method is to sell a Token Note entirely
secured on the contracts the company has in place with high-quality clients such as Bank of
England.
This Token Note repays the Token Noteholders (Principle-Annual Dividend Min.) with a
lump sum repayment at the end of the Token Note’s term of ሺCum. Interestሻ.
The Dividend Min. is a repayment fraction representing the next years’ hypothetical Capital
Repaid amount (if the Token Note had another term) and serves as a guaranteed minimum
dividend payment over the term of the Token Note for the shareholders who accept the
offer.  If earnings remained just at the 2015 level (GBX 38.9m/$60.27m) then the total
market cap (GBX 1,167/$1,808m) * 25x * 1.25% is equal to the dividend payment (GBX
12.15m/$18.83m).

Thus the total offer without accounting for reinvested dividends and assuming that 2015
earnings remain flat comes to GBX 975.88m ($1,500m) or 999p per share.
The minimum the investors can expect to receive in annual dividends is GBX 10,496,641
per year which comes out of the payments made from the principle repayments to the
Token Noteholders.
The following is an example of a Token Note that would operate as a form of medium-
/long-term financing for the hostile takeover described:

1.0 MONKEY CAPITAL’S DYNAMIC VALUE MODELLING
MONKEY CAPITAL LLP
MONKEY CAPITAL PTE.                                                                                MONKEY CAPITAL PLC

Arbitrage: MNY (Crypto) - Shares (FIAT)
Traditionally, Value has been a very static device: it is linked in some intrinsic fashion to an
asset base, an earnings schedule etc.
In fact, so unusual is the notion of unhooking value from these variables that the chief
stumbling block of many people today in understanding how a token evolves as its own




MONKEY CAPITAL ICO WHITE PAPER - JULY 2017                                                      39
sui generis value property or how it functions in an economic context is trying to
comprehend how a unit of value can exist without dependence on the latter.
The core innovation at the heart of Monkey Capital’s arsenal is our ability to experiment
with and create what we call Dynamic Value. Dynamic Value is where two functionally
independent asset classes - for example, a share in a public company and a token trading
on a digital exchange - converge to form a type of arbitrage whereby risk and management
are the only outside variables one is calculating.
When we showed our model to some professional investors, their comments were that the
token holders clearly advantaged from the LP earnings of the structure more so than the
shareholders of the public company, but that this should be the case as well, since the token
holders depended on the trust of the management team of Monkey Capital to a much
greater extent in order to receive their income.
This is a valid observation. However, what it does not include as a footnote is the
observation that Monkey Capital too depends upon its standing within the token buyers
community for its own enhanced Goodwill. Goodwill is a type of intangible asset value
ascribed to a firm’s strength of branding in the market. For Monkey Capital, Goodwill is
pretty much all it has to rely on to generate liquidity in the marketplace for its tokens, to
establish a robust presence in Crypto trading, and therefore to exist in the first place.
Thus, Dynamic Value is created for the very first time in history here: one in which there is
an interdependence between the customer and the management to such an extent that the
two roles are constantly in synch with one another.
1.1 DIFFERENTIAL PROPERTIES OF UNITS
Due to the inherently diluted status of a shareholding, we are most certain that the
shareholders of the public entity will soon become token holders as well, in both COEVAL
and the Parent-Child Tokens, which is to say MNY, KEY and CAPS, and the subset Tokens
EVM and MNV.
This is simply because it would make little sense to receive an annual distribution which is
a fraction of the public entity’s earnings and not share in the larger pool of the winnings
after Goodwill has properly been established between the company and the end user of the
investment product spectrum. Shares are inherently diluted whereas in the case of hard
cap Tokens they are not, meaning that as the public entity utilizes its share purchases to
expand the asset base of the Limited Partnership, the exponential value arbitrage offset
upon the Token-Equity unit exchange is massively enhanced. Ultimately, this will give us
and our customers a chance to extract an additional form of value: the arbitrage value

inherent in the Crypto-FIAT Embryo/Parent-Share exchange. But this is a subject for the
following update of the White Paper. The main point is this - the value creation
mechanisms, when Dynamic in form, are simply endless.
