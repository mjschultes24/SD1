The Movement DAO
WHITEPAPER VERSION 1  /  10.09.17
ABSTRACT
The Movement is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization  (DAO) that is
entirely owned and shaped by its participants. By harnessing the power of
the Ethereum computing platform and related cutting-edge technologies, the
world’s first fully crowdsourced DAO is being created. Without any central
leader and built from the bottom up, the Movement supports humans on the
internet to come together and create freely.
New and innovative spaces are emerging, communities and markets governed by
internet citizens are arising. Independent from government agendas or corporate
entities, the Movement uses the latest technology to offer a decentralized and
unstoppable breeding ground for people from all around the world to connect
and create.

Today, people from all around the world have access to the internet, allowing
anyone to potentially interact, cooperate, and create. Decentralized blockchain
technology can be utilized to facilitate new opportunities for connecting with
fellow humans, allowing friendship across cultures to be made and enhanced.
With access to the growing capabilities of the digital world, before us lie unima-
ginable ways of collaboration. In today’s world society that is growing more and
more intertwined, people can have the power to personally create and recreate
parts of both the digital and analog environments that they live in by cultivat-
ing networks based on trust and friendship, thereby transcending organizational
boundaries.
The ever-increasing digitalization brings with it both new benefits and issues.
By focusing on the human roots of technology, the beneficial power of the inter-
net can be fuel for positive social activity. In this interwoven analog and digital
1




world, the true power of decentralized movements by and for humans comes to
light. The Movement aims at building bridges between existing forms of orga-
nizations, be it social groups or full-fledged non-government organizations, and
decentralized blockchain technology. Its core idea is not against governments
but for people a priori - guided by the vision of creating valuable environments
and sustainable networks.

The Movement is establishing a virtual meeting point for participants to interact
and create. In addition to traditional channels such as websites and forums,
anyone with access to the internet and a web browser will be able to immerse
in Greenpoint, a place in a 3D open virtual reality world. Having acquired 50,000
MANA (50 LAND, 1000 MANA = 1 LAND) in the original Decentraland token
sale, the Movement is securing its headquarters for the community within the
virtual world of the future.
By using our own decentralized LAND, we build an environment that thri-
ves to create new opportunities for human collaboration. No matter where you
reside, the virtual world offers a meeting point to connect to at any time. On
top of that, Greenpoint is owned and fully shaped by the Movement’s partici-
pants, creating an immutable record of ownership. Within the land, you can
use Decentraland’s native currency MANA, as well as The Movement’s TAO
token.
We will begin by building a virtual coffeehouse for people to get together.
Greenpoint is a place where people can meet, new organizations can be created,
and existing organizations can connect. Whether you would like to hang out
with friends, lead stimulating conversations, or start a new social movement, the
green meeting point is a vibrant place to get started. You are heartily invited
to come around.

Host a meeting or a party in the virtual world. Create a study or research
group. Connect with likeminded people and make new friends. Engage in crea-
tivity exercises. Start a social movement. Do what you love. Greenpoint is a
place to connect.

To incentivize activity within the organization’s movements, as well as to allow
participants to vote and take part in the creation and governance of the DAO’s
parts, The Movement introduces TAO. The TAO token is based on Ethereum’s
ERC20 Token Standard. No ICO has been held, and no funds have been raised.
The Movement, in essence, is not for profit but for people.
On August 06, 2017, a bot called Dropper  (Bitcointalk ID 1091123) posted
the Movement’s original announcement thread on the Bitcointalk forums, al-
lowing Bitcointalk members to apply for a free so-called airdrop by sending
a private message to the bot. Thousands of accounts applied to become early
participants of the organization, and eventually, about 700 founding members
were accepted. To ensure widespread distribution only one account per person
is allowed - alt accounts, automated signups, and robots are effectively removed
by an extensive audit system. Over the course of several weeks, the Movement’s
founding members voted the airdrop to end on August 31, 2017.
In order to distribute TAO in a fair and beneficial manner, every partici-
pant’s activity towards the project is measured. Before the official genesis snap-
shot and the establishment of The Movement on the Ethereum blockchain,
all participants can increase their activity and earn a higher share by actively
participating in creating and extending the DAO’s infrastructure. TAO is distri-
buted proportional to each participant’s contributions towards the DAO, and
according to the below scheme consisting of both Bitcointalk Activity Ranks
3




and Movement Activity Ranks. The number next to each rank is the respective
activity value.
Bitcointalk Ranks: Newbie 2, Junior 1.75, Member 1.5, Full Member 1, Se-
nior Member 0.9, Hero 0.8, Legendary 0.7 (Decreasing numbers: higher reward
in TAO)
Movement Activity Ranks: Idler 0.5, Mover 1, Contributor 1.75, Ambas-
sador 2, Developer 3 (Increasing numbers: higher reward in TAO)
In total, 3,000,000 (3 Million) TAO will be created and distributed according
to the below formula (where ∆ = founding member and τ = TAO):
{(3, 000, 000τ/(∆total ∗ ∆rank)) ∗ (∆activity + boni)}
The absolute amount of TAO distributed to each participant will become
available on the official data spreadsheet. TAO will be distributed between the
end of September and the first half of October 2017. It will be solely in the hands
of the community and can be used to incentivize activity and the creation of
value. If you are a founding member it is a wise idea to redistribute a part of
your TAO tokens and reward people for valuable contributions. The DAO is not
affiliated with or controlled by any third party entities, and it is solely governed
and shaped by those who take part in its development and governance.

The Movement will run on the Ethereum blockchain and make use of advanced
technologies such as the Aragon Network (which acts as a digital jurisdiction
that makes it easy and friendly for organizations to operate on the blockchain),
the District0x Network (which is a network of decentralized markets and com-
munities), as well as the Decentraland Open Virtual Reality Platform (which
builds a virtual open world that runs on open standards).

This symbiosis constitutes the foundation for the Movement’s decentralized
organizational structure. Holders of TAO will be able to make proposals and
vote. In the virtual meeting place Greenpoint, people can get together. The
Movement DAO’s infrastructure will be built over time and is a collective work
of the community. Core developers are working on the technical infrastructu-
re, and all participants together are building and growing the Movement by
“painting the walls with many magnificent colors”.

No matter if you are among the approximately 700 founding members of The
Movement or simply interested in its endeavor, please feel free to join and take
part anytime you wish. Simply start by visiting one of the official channels and
reaching out to members of the community. Founding members are responsible
for TAO’s redistribution by offering TAO rewards. Make new friends and create
value.

The name DAO refers to “Decentralized Autonomous Organization” and is often
linked to “TheDAO” which was founded in 2016. However, The Movement DAO
is not an investor-directed venture capital fund as TheDAO manifested. The
Movement does not raise any funds, and its token, TAO, is distributed as a
free gift. Once the Movement is established, TAO is its fuel. There is no central
5




frequently  asked  questions
authority that owns TAO or can create more TAO. The token can only be
obtained by either participating in the community or by acquiring it on the open
market. Whereas TheDAO aimed at providing an entirely new model for the
organization of both commercial and non-profit organizations, The Movement
aims at providing a breeding ground for new ways of social collaboration. Fully
crowdsourced by and for the people and thereby built from the ground up, The
Movement is not designed for profit but for the advancement of cross-cultural
and transnational human interaction in conjunction with blockchain technology.
It is a decentralized organization that can evolve freely.
