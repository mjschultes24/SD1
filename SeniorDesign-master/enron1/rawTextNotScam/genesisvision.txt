contracts. We unite exchanges, brokers, traders, and investors into a decentralized, open and fair network, making
the financial market even more global. This will allow successful traders to rapidly scale their trading strategies by
attracting investments from around the world. The smart contract technology that underlies the platform will
provide an automated and absolutely transparent system for investment and profit distribution.
The Genesis Vision platform is the solution for the most crucial industry problems, such as limitedness due to the
lack of information, lack of transparency and, consequently, lack of trust.
Fundraising and the use of GVT (Genesis Vision Token) will help to finance product development, marketing and
advertising for the development of the platform. GVT is an internal currency of Genesis Vision platform and will be
used for all investment operations and profit distributions.
2. Market Description
2.1 Market Participants
Managers
Management funds/traders are companies/individuals with a proven trading history, ready
to acquire investors' money for management. The profit, received as a result of
management of the total funds, is shared proportionally between the managers and
investors. Managers receive a commission for management and a commission from the
profit (success fee).
Investors
Investors do not trade in the market directly. Instead, investors transfer their funds to
experienced traders who manage the funds for them. Investors get their shares from their
managers’ profits.
Brokers
Brokers are companies that have the appropriate licenses to carry out brokerage activities.
Through brokers, traders have access to trading financial instruments on exchange and
over-the-counter markets.

Traditional Trust Management
From a technological point of view, traditional fiduciary management systems are a black box to potential investors,
because how they work is not always known or understood. In any event, all of the current solutions boil down to
the investor using some software to transfer money to a financial manager and then waiting to receive profits.
However, investors have no opportunity to control their own funds. Furthermore, the fiduciary management system
itself doesn't give investors any technical abilities to ensure that their funds are returned, nor does it provide an
understanding of how the money is used.
The investors receive a statistic on the use of their assets and the financial manager's performance, but this statistic is
determined entirely by the company and financial manager. At present, investors have essentially no way to verify
this information. Too often, the real situation is understood too late, when the money can no longer be returned.
Dishonest companies exploit this, scheming to attract customers by using high figures that turn out to be not so
promising in reality.
Our system adds transparency and, on a technological level, increases asset security and information reliability.
Decentralization guarantees that one person won't be able to use the entire system for his personal interests.
3. Description of the Problem
Despite the industry's steady growth, existing trust management mechanisms do not meet the requirements of
modern investors and managers.
Managers, and consequently their investors, are tied to their brokers/exchanges. Simultaneously, there is no
consolidated reliable source of information or statistics. This deprives investors of flexibility in their choices and limits
the manager’s ability to attract new funds.

The lack of transparency further exacerbates the situation. Brokers have the technical ability to influence the data on
the trade history and statistics of their managers. The potential investor does not have the ability to distinguish the
real trade history from the counterfeit, and the existing graph of the manager's profit from the "drawn". The
mechanisms of investment, distribution of profits and commissions are hidden inside the realization of trading
platforms and are not open to market participants.

- Information can’t be verified
A large number of fraudulent conducts in the trust management market was detected in recent years[1]. A lot of
Ponzi schemes were created under the guise of currency, stocks and other assets trading. Fraudsters used the fact
that technological solutions for trust management by default are very complicated and non-transparent for users.
As a result, customers lost their money overnight, and investor’s confidence in the market as a whole began to fall.
The natural reaction for this situation was tightening the regulations in this sphere. Nowadays companies have to
come a long and expensive way in order to obtain licence for trust management activities. Conscientious
companies have to implement complex and costly reporting and auditing systems as well as to impose serious
restrictions for investors. Obviously, neither companies nor investors benefit from that. However, offshore companies
continue operating without licences and deceiving their clients.
All of these factors lead to serious limitations on the potential of market participants, lack of usability, and lack of
trust.
Despite the visibility of the existing problems in the industry, for the past 10 years,  the mechanisms of interaction
between market participants have not undergone significant changes. This indicates the need to introduce new
technologies that will change the current situation.
We believe that one of such technologies can become the blockchain. Implementation of blockchain will allow
trust management market to achieve transparency and efficiency on the technological level. This will help to regain
the trust to the market. Besides that, it will attract the attention of new companies and the investors of the new
digital generation.

4. Our Solution
Genesis Vision is a decentralized trust management platform built on blockchain technology and smart contracts.
Blockchain technology provides indispensable advantages, such as openness, immutability, and
censorship-resistance of all stored information, whereas smart contracts, which will be carrying out investment and
profit distribution, make these processes completely transparent and open.
Each manager in the Genesis Vision network has his own cryptocurrency. The size of the issue depends on
successful trade statistics. The process of transferring funds to the manager is carried out by buying a manager's
cryptocurrency on the internal exchange.
From manager’s point of view, the trade process will not change. The trader will continue to operate on the
exchange or through a convenient broker. Genesis Vision, in turn, represents a common open source of reliable
information about the statistics of the network participants' activities and an absolutely transparent system of
investment and profit distribution, built on smart contracts.

Internal exchange of managers’ cryptocurrencies
Internal exchange of the Genesis Vision platform is the place where investors can purchase and sell managers’ coins.
Managers have a limited amount of coins, which depends on their level. Initially, these coins can only be purchased
directly from the manager for a fixed price. Afterwards, they can be freely traded among the investors on the
internal exchange. In this case, investors set their own price for their managers’ coins. The cost of these coins will
depend on the success of a manager’s trading because the manager’s profitable trading makes his/her coins
"profitable."

Platform
6.1 Connecting a Broker
The broker's connection scheme is as simple as possible: the owner of the trading platform only needs to install the
Genesis Vision software, which is free and distributed with an open license.
Brokers can also provide potential managers’ access to the Genesis Vision Manager registration function in their
client application - generally a "Become a Genesis Vision Manager" button.
17




6.2 Connecting Managers
Traders submit applications either through their brokers’ websites, connected to the Genesis Vision network, or
directly through the website http://genesis.vision. Under simple conditions (having a minimum amount of one’s
own funds in a trading account), the trader becomes the manager on the Genesis Vision platform. From that
moment, all managers’ trades will be automatically verified, uploaded, and recorded in a smart contract, building a
trustworthy trading history and statistics.
A new manager registration triggers the emission of his own cryptocurrency in the initial amount of one thousand
coins, available for purchase to any member of the network. Additional issue of coins (i.e., attraction of additional
funds to management) depends on the level of the manager, which, in turn, directly depends on the success
indicators of a particular manager’s trading.
Available investments depend on the level of the manager:

The manager trades using both his capital and the funds invested by investors. The profit received as a result of the
trade is automatically distributed proportionally between managerial token holders at the end of the reporting
period. Managers themselves choose the length of the reporting period, according to their trading strategies. The
choice is limited to options such as one week, two weeks, one month or three months
18




6.3 Managers’ Coins
Investing is performed by purchasing a manager's cryptocurrency. This method has several advantages over the
traditional scheme of transferring money to a manager’s account:
The manager's coin itself is an asset. At any time, the investor can transfer/sell this cryptocurrency on the
internal exchange. The investor has the right to return the coins to the manager. However, the return occurs
only at the end of the reporting period.
The additional element of gamification appears. Unlike the traditional scheme, the user does not just give his
money to an unknown until the end of the reporting period. Instead, the user buys “tangible” coins that are
displayed in his or her personal cabinet and can be cashed at any time. This encourages investors to
potentially assemble large packages of different coins, which is a contrast to traditional investing.
There is an additional factor of involvement and user retention. In the traditional investment scheme,
investors are not involved in the process that occurs between the moment of investing and making profits. In
our case, they will be able to constantly monitor the exchange rates of their managers' coins and the issuance
of new coins, trade cryptocurrency on the internal exchange and so forth.
When investors purchase coins, GVTs are transferred to a broker's account, where they are converted to required
currency and transferred to a manager's trading account. Coin holders receive part of the manager's profits,
according to their share, minus the manager's commission and fee. The investor has the right to transfer coins or sell
on the internal exchange.
The investor can withdraw invested money, but only at the end of the reporting period, having previously created an
application for withdrawal. In the case of returns, the investor receives the money according to his or her share, and
the coins are returned to the manager for further sale on the internal exchange.
6.4 Detailed Process Description

Reporting period
During the reporting period, the manager trades on his or her trading platform with the amount of funds
available at the beginning. The history of its trading is unloaded from the trading platform and recorded in
IPFS in real time.
The manager can leave a request for deposit/withdrawal of his own funds from his trading account, which
will be processed at the end of the reporting period. In this case, the amount of remaining funds should not
be less than the minimum amount.
Investors can buy the manager’s coins on the primary market for GVT. In this case, the transaction is recorded
in the manager's smart contract and will be implemented at the end of the reporting period.
Investors can freely transfer and sell their coins on the internal exchange.
Investors can leave requests for withdrawal of their invested funds, which will be processed at the end of the
reporting period.

6.5 Managers’ Trading History Control
One of the most important problems solved by Genesis Vision platform is the managers’ trading history control and
verification.
If we were able to record all transactions in blockchain in real time, it would be a possible solution. But this is not feasible for
a number of reasons:
Blockchain technical limitations. Processing of such a large number of transactions will create considerable
load on blockchain platform.
Not all managers will agree to publish all their transactions in real time out of concern for their trading
strategies protection.
The problem of blockchain limitation can be avoided by using a number of existing technologies and new solutions:
The broker’s trading platform plug-in writes all transactions in IPFS.
An off-chain communication channel is created between members of the network (using the  Whisper
protocol or any other). After each manager’s transaction, a hash of the current trading history is sent to the
network.
20




Special service verifies that there were no history amendments, using received hashes and IPFS data.
Publishing managers’ trades in real time potentially endangers their unique trading strategy. That is why traditional
trust management systems usually offer an option to hide trading history during the reporting period.
In Genesis Vision it would be implemented as follows:
At the beginning of reporting period, broker’s trading platform plug-in generates a crypto key for the
manager.
All managers’ transactions are written in IPFS encrypted.
At the end of reporting period, a key for decryption is published and the entire trading history becomes
public and available for validation by hashes.
7. The Implementation of the Genesis
Vision Network
All code will be open and distributed with the maximum open license.
Brokers will be able to install software for integration, if their trading platform is supported.
Any developer or company will be able to add support for additional trading platforms.
Trading instruments, exchanges and markets are not limited.
Connection to the Genesis Vision network is free of charge and is performed by the brokers or exchanges on
their own, or with the help of our partners.
Brokers and exchanges operating in crypto-markets will be involved.
7.1 Capturing the Market
The Genesis Vision project team has a number of advantages that will allow the project to be successful, and, most
importantly, to be applied in a real operating business.
Our partners' companies have been engaged in technological maintenance and software development for
brokerage companies, mainly in foreign exchange markets. Their experience allows them to integrate all of the
necessary software into the industry without unnecessary costs and delays or difficulties from the broker’s side. For
example our partner Tools For Brokers inc. is servicing more than 250 companies from thirty different countries
(35% - Europe, 35% - Asia, 25% - Middle East, 5% - Others).
All of these companies are potential brokers for the project. At the moment, Tools For Brokers already sells a similar
centralized solution that is installed in the environment of a particular broker. This software was purchased by more
than eighty different companies around the world. The total turnover of funds through this trust management
21




system amounted to more than $100 billion.
Considering our more than 400 contacts with brokerages among our partners and advisers, we expect at least 100
brokerages to join our distributed system within 2 years.
This will attract more than 100,000 investors and roughly 10,000 financial managers. According to industry reports,
the average trading volume for a single investor is 5 Lots (500,000 USD including leverage) per month. Thus, the total
trading volume in our distributed system could reach 50 billion USD.
Since this statistics involves only existing customers, it will make Genesis Vision one of the largest blockchain
applications.
Current situation on the potential market shows that a new project with a decentralized transparent system is in
demand in an industry in which regulation has become tougher, and transparency has become the main
competitive advantage. It will soon become the only way to work in the market, which is why cooperation with
financial brokers was chosen as the starting point of the project.
Trust management industry receives much negative feedback due to persistent stereotype of sticky-fingered brokers
and overall lack of understanding of the industry operation mechanisms. We want to make it cleaner and better by
using the latest technologies. Thanks to the Genesis Vision project, we will do it.
This will allow the project to move from the idea phase to an operating business as soon as possible. We will also
further develop the project for all other markets including stock markets, cryptocurrency markets, futures markets,
and so forth.
7.2 Possible Problems and Their Solutions
Blockchain restrictions
ICO tokens sale and Genesis Vision platform prototype development will take place on Ethereum platform. We
have chosen Ethereum because it is currently the most popular and functional blockchain platform. However,
Ethereum has a number of serious and well-known flaws, the most critical being its lack of scalability and its high
transaction cost.
At the early stage of our project, it’s not a serious problem. However, the expected scale of Genesis Vision platform,
according to the number of our potential broker clients, represents tens of thousands of managers, hundreds of
thousands of investors, and millions of transactions. This level of load currently cannot be handled by Ethereum.
Despite Ethereum's flaws, we love its technology and are following its development plans closely. Vitalik Buterin has
already announced many promising features in Ethereum's upcoming versions. We hope that these features will be
able to improve the current situation.
At the moment, we are continuing our platform development, based on Ethereum. But in case we reach
Ethereum's capabilities’ limit (presumably it can happen in a one-year period), we can decide to switch to another
blockchain, which will be able to meet the needs of the project.
Blockchain technologies are developing rapidly, and there are already some promising alternatives.
22




But in a one-year period, a new favorite may appear, and the choice will be obvious.
In case of blockchain platform change, all Ethereum tokens will be migrated. Token quantity and conditions for
holders will remain unchanged.
Currency conversion problems
Brokers will receive money from investors in GVT, but they will need to transfer funds to the manager's account in
the manager's account currency.
Brokers are currently working with several currencies, and many of them are starting to also support
cryptocurrencies:
https://www.allfxbrokers.com/brokers/deposit-options/bitcoin
https://www.100forexbrokers.com/bitcoin-brokers
In this way, brokers are able to cope with this problem on their own. However, in order to simplify this process for
them and to increase the number of potential customers, Genesis Vision will offer brokers the following solutions:
The opportunity to quickly exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat (as well as the reverse). For this purpose, we will
have exchange partners and exchangers.
A solution providing the service of supporting GVT as currency of trading account. This will help to avoid
converting.
A solution to help in risk management for brokers.
8. Genesis Vision Fund
5% GVT will form the Genesis Vision fund. Tokens from this fund will be regularly invested in successful platform
managers. We plan to keep the fund operating regardless of the profit it generates, constantly stimulating Genesis
Vision managers’ activity.
The main objectives of the fund are:
Attracting managers in the system and stimulating their activities
Providing additional liquidity of GVT on exchanges
Providing additional liquidity of managers’ tokens
8.1 Genesis Vision Investment AI
Investment decision-making process will be carried out by GV fund management AI. This system will utilize both
Genesis Vision’s and our partners’ robust financial expertise and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

9. Project Economics
9.1 Sources of Project Profit
The project will receive profit from commissions on investment operations. Each investment will be charged 0.5%³
of the operation amount.
The project will also generate profit from managing its own fund and by investing it in successful managers of our
platform.

10.1 Genesis Vision ICO Options
Recent ICO campaigns identified a number of problems in this process:
People who have been following the project for a long time can simply be late to invest money.
A large influx of transactions in the first minutes after the launch of the ICO creates difficulties for ICO
investors and other Ethereum blockchain users.
Due to the geographical dispersion of investors, participation for many of them may be compounded by the
fact that the launch of ICO falls on a deep night in their time zone.
Early investment bonuses are often given not to actual first supporters, but to those who managed to be the
first to carry out a transaction in the blockchain.
To solve these and a number of other problems, Genesis Vision team is launching an option program for ICO
participation.
Conditions
Genesis Vision option guarantees the right to acquire GVT tokens at a specified price during the ICO. Genesis Vision
option token is based on ERC20 Ethereum token standard.
The option price is 5% of the desired amount of investment.
Options will also give additional bonuses for tokens’ amount:
To acquire the option, an ICO investor pays 5% of his total desired amount of investments. The amount of tokens
available for the purchase during the ICO is calculated according to this formula:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                          A GVT
C op                                                                                                                   - the price of the option

Example:
An investor wants to invest $1000 in an upcoming ICO.
Suppose the current ICO bonus is 30%.
The price of the option is 5% of the total amount - $50. Investor can pay corresponding amount in any of supported
currencies. The amount of GVT available with this option will be:
1000
A GVT                                                                                                                        +      30%   1300 GVT
1
The price of each GVT will be:
                                                                                                                             1000   -     50
C GVT                                                                                                                                                $0.73 per token
1300
In this example, investors are guaranteed to be able to purchase up to 1300 GVT by the price of $0.73 per token
during the first day of ICO.
On the first day⁴ of ICO, tokens will be sold to option holders only. When option holder purchases GVT during the
ICO, his option (or a part of the option) is exercised: option tokens are burned and a corresponding amount of GVT is
acquired.
If investors didn’t exercise the option on the first day of the ICO, they can do it on any other day, but in this case the
option will be exercised only if the ICO pool has enough tokens. If option holders do not exercise their options
during the ICO, the options will be cancelled. Options can be exercised partially.
Options are non-refundable; money collected from sold options can be spent by Genesis Vision immediately on
platform development and marketing.
11. Genesis Vision Token
Genesis Vision has its own token:  GVT ( Genesis Vision Token). GVT is based on ERC20 Ethereum token standard.
GVT will be used for all investment operations, profit distributions, and managers’ token trading on the internal
exchange.
All tokens will be created during the ICO period. The number of tokens is limited, and the subsequent issuance of
tokens is technically impossible. Unsold tokens during the ICO are burned.
The GVT is based on the Ethereum blockchain. Its implementation corresponds to a widely distributed standard.
This allows token holders to easily store and manage them using existing implementations of Ethereum wallets.
The  GVT will be freely traded on crypto-exchanges.
[4] This period can be changed in case of emergency situations during the first day of ICO                                   26




11.1 Factors Influencing GVT Price Growth
Because the number of tokens is limited and subsequent issuance is not all allowed, the price of GVT will be
determined by demand. Demand for GVT will grow due to the following factors:
All investment operations will be executed in GVT. Accordingly, increase in Genesis Vision network members’
trading volume will increase demand for tokens.
The volume of the potential market supported by GVT significantly exceeds the tokens' market capitalization
at the time of the ICO.
Genesis Vision has a well-thought-out development and marketing plan that will consistently increase the
project's audience and the amount of investments.
Genesis Vision already has partners preceding its launch who will provide an active client base (our partners
include 400 brokers around the world).
12. Development Plan
The budget and components are planned, assuming that our fundraising efforts will reach the estimated
maximum amount. Otherwise, a part of the components will have to be abandoned, and the budget will be
reduced for the remaining features.
