ODEM Technical Whitepaper v1.4 November, 2018
1                                                                                              OVERVIEW
Overview
Introduction
ODEM, a global educational provider, has the world’s first blockchain-driven software
platform built on top of Ethereum’s decentralized ledger technology. ODEM aims to make
blended education more affordable, accessible, verifiable, and transferable by leveraging
blockchain technology and Ethereum’s ERC-20 based ODEM Tokens (ODE).                           n ODEM’s
presale and main token event in early 2018, ODEM sold approximately 100 million ODE (about
10,000 ETH, which was worth about $10 million at the time).
ODEM facilitates blended education (and eventually live streamed and online programs)
through several core services.
Platform Technology Overview
ODEM creates a marketplace through an open source onchain Ethereum-based ERC20 utility
token used to transact ODEM digital assets and sets of corresponding smart contracts to
manage transactional data related to education programs and credentials. This along with
an offchain proprietary cloud-based platform provides students, educators, employers,
and other stakeholders easy-to-use tools to participate in academic programs and receive
blockchain-based educational certificates.
ODEM Platform
Unlike the onchain DApp, the Platform resides in a central location. Built with standard web
and HTML technologies, the Platform is connected to the Ethereum blockchain using a web3
JavaScript library.
Within the ODEM Platform, users will see:
•   Their profile
•   Programs
•   Events
•   Certificates obtained

ODE (ERC-20)
The ERC-20 ODE sold in the crowdsale will provide access to the ODEM Platform through
the staking process. The ODE economic model is based on the Sweetbridge Foundation’s
discount-token research. The design isolates the utility of ODE on the Platform from external
market forces, ensuring that use of ODE is always advantageous.
The ODEM staking architecture is based on adoption of the Ethereum ERC-900 interface. A
student stakes a desired program by committing a small amount of ODE. Educators stake
courses they intend to teach. Staking assists the Platform in assessing levels of student and
educator interest. If a participant backs out, their staked tokens are forfeited. Using ODE
eliminates issues associated with fiat, including high fees and lengthy processing times.
ODEM Credits
ODEM uses the ERC-780 protocol for creation of ODEM-Credits (ODEM-C). Adaptation of the
protocol will account for a more general payload and limit the transfer method. ODEM-C are
digital certificates stored on the blockchain that are given to users who successfully complete
educational offerings.

The ODEM-C includes the name of the student, educator, program, and institution, the
program’s date, and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) hash where the physical certificate
can be accessed with a passphrase.
ODEM Student Education DApp Solutions
Our solution architecture is broken down by value proposition for the student, our core
consumer on the ODEM Platform. We are creating a series of smart contrac                        hat
will be made available for use on the Ethereum blockchain in early 2019.
ODEM Platform Use Cases Introduction
1. Accessibility
Education Program Staking (EPS) is when a student makes a commitment to enroll in a
program offered on the ODEM Platform. The student will typically stake, or deposit, about
10 percent of the full price of the program. Staking helps the Platform assess demand and
discourages students from frivolously signing up for programs. If a student stakes a program
and later backs out, the stake will be forfeited. Educators are also required to stake their
intention to offer an ODEM program.
2. Verifiability and Transferability
Since educational diplomas and credentials are still managed almost entirely by centralized
learning institutions, verification of one’s education for the purpose of either employment
or continued education is completely dependent on the physical institutions’ centralized
authority.
ODEM leverages the trustless nature of blockchain technology to move the authority of
education verification onto the blockchain. Once mass adoption occurs, it allows other
decentralized educational providers to offer programs and be recognized as legitimately
credentialing bodies. This will create opportunities for new and nontraditional education
models to be recognized and legitimized in the search for gainful employment and better
transferability for relocation and future education.

To achieve this, ODEM has created a set of smart contracts and interfaces through its
Platform that allow educational certificates of any kind to be created, signed, verified,
secured, shared, and managed entirely on the blockchain. These applications include:
ODEM’s ERC780 Certificate created using Digital Education Certification (DEC). DEC
acts as a blockchain instance of a student’s education certificate representing a completed
educational experience digitally signed and verified by the educator (and if applicable, the
institution). ODEM DECs are immutable certificates on the blockchain owne
dbytihestudentr
The core data includes the public key of the stakeholders and their transactions live and
onchain. The corresponding metadata reflecting this education program is captured and
managed securely and offchain on the ODEM Platform. Students can view digital certificates
through a combination of accessing their onchain certification and logging into the Platform.
ODEM requires a small amount of ODE for each certificate created on the blockchain.
As students accumulate blockchain certificates, their experiences can be managed in
aggregate through an Education Activity Repository (EAR). An EAR is a secure record of an
individual’s educational history as verified by the educational institutions that the student has
attended.
Should a student lose access to their educational identity such as in the case of displaced
refugee populations, ODEM has a social claims verification process where a student’s
educational records can be recreated through a process called Identity Through Education
(ITE). Once recreated, the students records become part of their immutable EAR.
Independent Credentialing Verification (ICV): Allows academic records to be automatically
transferred from the blockchain to an academic institution’s database.
Education Skill Badges (ESB): Digital badges of a student’s accomplishments and on-the-job
skills verified by an employer that are stored on the blockchain.
Training Education Records (TER): An employee’s training credentials issued by an employer
that are stored on the blockchain. They collectively represent a lifetime of learning and
personal improvement.

3. Affordability
The ODEM Platform reduces the cost of education by offering short-term academic programs
(instead of more expensive four-year degrees) and allowing students to bid on courses
and programs.
Not only can students have complete control over their educational records through ODEM
certificates, they can also receive ODE by letting employers and other interested parties view
their certifications through the Education Certification Viewing (ECV) contract. This allows
third parties such as employers to purchase access to students’ digital certificates. Access
fees are shared with opted-in users. ODEM charges an ODE fee for viewing (the fee is split
some % between ODEM and the students).
Program Revenue Sharing (PRS): Using smart contracts to automatically distribute revenue
to ODEM Platform Partners, including speaking and literary agents, when their services are
delivered through the ODEM Platform.
Perpetual Curriculum Royalty (PCR): ODE are sent to educators when their licensed
curriculum is used by other educators for teaching. Smart contracts automatically send ODE
when third-party educators access licensed material through a passphrase. There is an ODEM
fee associated with this process.
Education Token Sponsorships (ETS): Similar to scholarships, ETS fund the cost of studies for
disadvantaged students and use smart contracts to ensure that conditions on the donations
are being fulfilled.
Professional Skills Network (PSN): Informs ODEM’s employment partners of students who
have completed specific program requirements for potential hiring.
Currency Agnostic Settlement (CAS): ODEM will leverage blockchain-based mechanisms to
use ODE as a voucher for use on the platform. ODE will be used on the Platform to ensure
fast, reliable, cross-border, transactions with multiple parties on each side regardless of
currency type.

Excelorators Partnership and Beta Adoption
The ODEM team was inspired by the success of its partner, Excelorators Inc. For six years,
Excelorators has provided high-quality educational services to overseas students, managers,
and executives on the campuses of top U.S. learning institutions. Excelorators’ clients will
test the ODEM Platform in preparation for mass adoption. ODEM will stake on behalf of
Excelorators’ students and educators during testing.
White Paper
Through the achievement of operational efficiencies in the ODEM Platform, Excelorators
expects to reduce the cost of its educational programs.

ODEM Development Environment
ODEM Decentralized App (DApp): Open Source
The DApp forms the backend to the ODEM Platform. The DApp’s smart contract links
students, educators, and service providers considering educational offerings.
ODEM is creating a set of smart contracts, protocols, and standards to interact with ODE on
the Ethereum platform. These self-executing contracts incorporate unique terms and criteria
such as a program’s value in ODE, duration, and location. The contracts manage transactions
in ODE to educators and the issuance of students’ certificates. The DApp stores data about
participants to assist on decisions about their future engagement in academic programs on
the Platform.

Private Keys
ODEM is providing integration of online and hard wallet providers with front-end user friendly
wallet management of private keys. ODEM will not hold private keys or ODE directly for the
users of the ODEM Platform.
Necessity of ODE
The ODE, in addition to being used for staking, drives the ODEM-C smart contract. Controlling
staking requirements is used to tune the system. Maintaining a properly tuned staking
requirement is difficult if secondary market forces dictate the staked tokens’ utility. By using
ODE, the effect of external market fluctuations will be reduced.
Velocity Problem
With instantaneous transactions, there is a problem with velocity where a token that is spent
does not have any real consistent forces on the price. By staking ODE, a function for the
Token of just passing through is created. For more about the velocity problem please click
here.

Documentation
1. Educational Program Token Staking (EPS)
Students and educators will use ERC-20-based ODE to commit to academic program
offerings by staking. Participants commit ODE to lock in their financial com                  t. ODEM‘s
staking model follows predefined conditions that grant reward ODE for following through. It
docks fees when commitments are not upheld. When a program is scheduled and participants
have met all conditions, the staked ODE will be unlocked.
The process is applicable to individual offerings and programs. They do not require another
smart contract. Programs can be set up by configuring educational offerings as defined by a
set of prerequisites.
Users will be able to see each other’s educational history and credibility scores based on
information stored in the Platform, DApp, and blockchain.
ODEM stakes = Percent of stake (based on Oracle / whitelist contract) x number of seats
created x cost to register for a seat.

pending the receipt of a sufficient number of students
2.   A student stakes ODE to request an offering or register for a program. A typical stake
will be as little as 10% of the final price of an academic program
3.   An educator can commit to teach an offering that a student requested
4.  When all the conditions are met, a program is ‘locked’
5.   A locked program triggers definitive collection of ODE in ODEM’s Settlement System
6.  The educator finishes the events within the program and issues digita                         rtificates to
students
7.   Staked ODE are unlocked and ODEM pays educators and service providers
ODEM Program Selection Generator
The ODEM Program Selection Generator uses data stored within the Platform, DApp, and
blockchain to make recommendations about educational offerings. A student, for example,
would request a preferred program, date, value in ODE, educator, location, lodging, and travel
options. The generator finds the closest matches to trigger program creation. It also creates a
smart contract for fulfillment, delivery, and ODE transfer.
Renege Policy
Penalties will apply for reneging on program commitments. ODEM reserves the right to levy
fines after observing user behavior. ODEM aims to incentivize responsible behavior and avoid
penalizing excessively. Some cases, such as a death in the family, may be unavoidable.
Surveys
ODEM users who participate in an educational offering will receive a questionnaire. Users
will be asked to rate other ODEM participants who attended the program. Survey responses
will influence the user’s educational rating on the Platform, DApp, and blockchain. Survey
participants may also be rewarded with ODE.

2. Digital Education Certification (DEC)
DEC refers to immutable digital records of academic accomplishment created for use in these
ways:
1.                                                                                             Permanently inserting the certification on the blockchain
2.   Creating indelible proof of participation and completion of programs on the ODEM
Platform for students and educators
3.   Creating a mirrored digital record of proof of completion of certificat                   on through other
traditional academic institutions or certification programs
ODEM will obtain a fee in ODE in exchange for the certificate creation from the issuing body
or institution.
3. Education Activity Repository (EAR)
Student transactions are hard to confirm, therefore, ODEM provides an Education Activity
Repository (EAR), which is a ledger that keeps track of educational activities.
Request                                                                                        Temporary

5. Education Certification Viewing (ECV)
ECV allows employers, universities, students, educators, and service providers to access
secure data. The information includes digital certificates, program activities and completion
rates, educator participation from opted-in users, and aggregated information within ODEM.
ODE are used for ECV access. The ODE used to access the ECV and aggregated data goes to
ODEM. Opted-in users whose data was viewed also receive ODE.

6. Perpetual Curriculum Royalty (PCR)
Educators will receive ODE in royalties when their licensed passphrase protected blockchain
stored curriculum is used by other educators. Smart contract execution of this process would
have an ODEM fee associated with it. Educators may want to use licensed courses instead
of creating their own as many are established successful courses, which tend to be more
economically efficient. In the ODEM Platform, educators will be able to see existing licensed
curriculum in which they can use for an educational offering.

by providing needed resources. Sponsorship includes paying for another student’s program,
curriculum, or program expenses. Sponsors can specify the types of students they want to
support. Selection criteria may include geography, family income, age, gender, and scholastic
record.

9. Independent Credentialing Verification (ICV)
ICV allows records to be automatically transferred from the blockchain to an academic
institution’s database. The institution can select the specific information they want to transfer.
10. Education Skill Badges (ESB)
ESB are students’ on-the-job skills that have been verified by employers that will be posted to
the blockchain. This will help students further their career. Students can stake ODE to attest
to skills to be validated by past and/or current employers. They will receive their stake back
upon the verification of the skills by the employer. A small amount of ODE will be used to post
the skill badge on the blockchain. The employer will receive a reward in ODE for participating
in this program.
11. Training Education Records (TER)
Employers can use ODE as vouchers to post employee training credentials on the blockchain.
Training credentials are from training programs taken internally with the employer that can be
used for employee advancement within the organization.
12. Incentive Management Program (IMP)
The IMP is an ODE reward system for ODEM Platform participants who complete actions such
as registering on the Platform, creating a profile, and/or completing an academic program.
13. Professional Skills Network (PSN)
Students who participate in training or obtain certificates on the ODEM Platform are eligible
for professional utilization via ODEM employment partners.

Glossary
Decentralized ledger - Also known as a blockchain. A system for recording transactions on
many computers that share control of the data.
Decentralized app (DApp) - An application in which the backend code runs within the
Ethereum blockchain. DApps must be completely open-source (without restrictions of
copyright or patent) and use a cryptographic token (such as ODE) for access.
ERC-20 - Defines a common list of rules for all Ethereum tokens to follow, including how
tokens are transferred and how users can obtain data about a token.
Ethereum - An open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and
operating system that was specifically designed to allow smart contract functionality.
Ethereum blockchain - A digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all Ethereum transactions.
Hash - A function that converts an input of letters and numbers into an encrypted output of a
