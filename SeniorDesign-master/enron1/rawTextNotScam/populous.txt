1.                                                                                             Abstract
Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are always in need of short-term financing
especially when there is a sudden and immediate need for increased working capital to
fund wages or the purchase of raw materials.   They will very often take out short-term
loans from their bank which is not the ideal solution and the short-term finance industry
is dominated by banks and other lending institutions such as the traditional invoice
finance companies.   However, newer and more innovative P2P (peer-to-peer) invoice
finance platforms have recently entered the industry.
These P2P invoice financing platforms operates in the same manner as the traditional
invoice financing companies by providing short term liquidity on invoices for short
durations of up to 90 days.  Rather than waiting for their customers to settle invoices that
have due dates of 45 to 90 days, the invoices can be sold to invoice financing companies
to access “immediate” funds.   P2P platforms are unique in that they connect invoice
sellers directly with invoice buyers making the rise of P2P as an alternative lending
platform more attractive to businesses globally.
The global invoice financing market was valued  $3 Trillion in  2013 and due to a
slow-down in the world economy the invoice financing market experienced a slight
contraction to approximately  $2.6 Trillion in  2016.   The business environment has
become more challenging and making it a more favorable environment for new fintech
start-up like Populous.
However, to  operate  in  this  industry without  a  deep  understanding  of  credit  and
underwriting principle can result in serious financial loss for the company as well as
investors.   Our in-depth knowledge and expertise in the short-term finance industry
allows us to build a P2P invoice financing platform using credit scoring and bankruptcy
formula such as the Altman Z-score.   We will also identify potential borrowers using
K-means cluster analysis.
When these formulas are combined with the XBRL data set we can perform “enhanced”
credit  risk  analysis  on  targeted  potential  borrowers,  linked  companies  and  their
customers.    Using Blockchain technology we can leverage smart contract to create a cost
effective  and  efficient  solution  by  providing  a  streamlined  funding  solution  to
businesses.   Blockchain technology also affords some security against fraud and can
prevent duplication in the selling of invoices.

Keeping a positive cash flow is the most important part for any SME, even more so in an
economy which is currently recovering from a recession. After all, having access to the
monies owed to an SME allows that SME to create new opportunities, develop existing
plans, purchase new equipment, pay salaries and negotiate the best terms with their
suppliers.
Unfortunately, keeping a regular flow of cash in the business is often easier said than
done especially if late payments to the SMEs are holding them back. It is currently
estimated  that  late  payments  are  costing  UK  SMEs  of  more  than                       £2bn  a  year
(Musaddique, 2017). If an SME is selling its products or services to other businesses on
credit terms, invoice factoring or invoice discounting also known as invoice finance, could
help.
It's a form of funding that releases the cash tied up in an SME’s outstanding sales
invoices instantly at a cost that both the SME and investors agree on. There are currently
over 40,000 businesses across the UK using invoice finance to support   them at various
stages in their business life cycle (Business Comparison, n.d.).
Furthermore, there are businesses across the UK at this moment using this form of
finance particularly at a time when more traditional financial institutions have been
turning down funding requests. As of 2016, approximately 50% of SMEs accounted for the
UKs total turnover (White, 2015) of £3 Trillion and 46% of SMEs experienced some form
of cash flow problem and late payment (Lobel, 2015).

Reporting Language “XBRL”
XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) is a global standard for exchanging
business information and is freely available to anyone. It is developed and published by
XBRL International, Inc. and it is used to define and exchange financial information.
Companies submit financial statements to government regulators each year using the
XBRL reporting format which standardises these data so they can be reviewed and
compared regardless of geographic origin.
HM Treasury made it a requirement to file all annual accounts and corporate tax returns
in XBRL format in April  2011  (GOV.UK, n.d.).    Following the announcement of this
requirement,  approximately                                                                 1.9  million  companies  now  file  annual  accounts  and
corporate tax returns in this format to UK Companies House and HM Revenue and
Customs (XBRL, 2015).
HM Revenue and Customs uses XBRL data to assess annual accounts and tax returns,
helps guide tax risk and policy decisions, judge the consequences of legal challenges and
gain a better understanding of the business. The government has indicated that the
implementation of XBRL filing have been extremely successful.

UK Companies House made available 6 years of worth of XBRL data at no cost and covers
over 1.9 million UK companies.  This data presented a good starting point to analyse past
financial data and forecast credit risks on companies covering a wide range of industries
and sectors.  Using these data we built a XBRL back-end to extract approximately over 2.8
billion points of data which formed part of our in-house credit reference system and
targeted marketing database.
3.1    Using XBRL in Targeted Client Acquisition
We have already tested the XBRL data extraction tool using 2012 data sets available
from UK Companies House.  The two data sets available for testing were the charge data
and accounting data.  Our goal in the test was to assess the validity of the extracted data
to  determine  whether  the  data  would  be  useful  to  selected  financial  institution’s
customers.
The following analysis results explain how we intend to target clients efficiently and
effectively.  This will ultimately lead to more SMEs obtaining invoice finance from us and
resulting in corresponding increase in our revenue model and hence increase in liquidity
for funding invoices on the platform.
Variables accounted for in this analysis are:
Company Number                                                                                 Company registration number
Company Name                                                                                   Name of the company
SIC Code - 78109                                                                               SIC code - activities of employment placement agencies
Debtors                                                                                        Debtor’s value
Creditors Due within 1 Year                                                                    Creditors who the business has to pay money for goods or
                                                                                               services or loans within a year
Cash Bank in Hand                                                                              Cash in hand or at the bank
Person Entitled to the Charge                                                                  Bank/person who lent the company money or took out the
charge on the company
Description of Charge                                                                          Type of charge registered

Our findings showed a number of observations favorable to what we wanted to achieve.
We took a deeper look into how the data can provide useful insight using cluster analysis
to give a different approach towards understanding patterns within the data set. In the
cluster analysis, we placed emphasis on three variables which are considered key lending
parameters in the finance industry, namely; debtors, creditors due within one year and
cash bank in hand.
Debtors   (£)                                                                                           Creditors Due Within One Year   (£)   Cash Bank Value (£)

Approximately  60  observations  were  recorded  and  we  selected  8  observations  to
demonstrate our finding in the cluster analysis.   The observations were further broken
down into 4 clusters to represent the four financial institutions we have used for this
analysis.  We considered the following financial institution in the cluster analysis:
BIBBY FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED
HSBC BANK PLC
LLOYDS TSB COMMERCIAL FINANCE LIMITED
RBS INVOICE FINANCE LIMITED
The clustering algorithm used to carry out this analysis is called the K-means Algorithm
and which have been statistically implemented on the dataset using the R-Programming
Language (Macqueen, 1967). The objective was to form clusters on the basis of common
behavior between the companies being considered based on the three key variables.
The K-means clustering output gave cluster sizes  18, 1, 31 and  6 for the financial
institutions considered.

3.2    Understanding the Analysis
The cluster analysis was very revealing and presented us interesting and useful metrics
of the finance industry. For example, there is a larger concentration of companies in
cluster 3 than in the other clusters. This indicates that most lenders according to the data
set would prefer to lend to companies that have variable values similar to the mean
variable values found in cluster 3.
Furthermore, the cluster analysis for Lloyds was found to contain more customers than
others. This type of analysis would be very useful to a competitor who may want to know
why Lloyds are gaining a larger market share and what level of lending they are
providing to their customers to acquire such a large customer base.
Cluster 2 showed HSBC only targeting the large companies when providing funding. The
analysis reveal a possible strategy worth pursuing in the knowledge that no other lender
were willing to lend to a company of that scale. To a lender with deep pockets, this could
prove to be a perfect strategy if executed correctly in a growing economy.
A lender armed with this sort of analysis can very quickly and easily identify the type and
size of companies needing finance, and most importantly its competitors’ strategies. This
information can form the basis to formulate strategies to grow market share and take
business from competitors.  Used Strategically, you can even dominate a relatively young
but strongly growing sector of the asset based lending industry even before it appears on
the radar of your competitors.
The K-means cluster analysis can form the basis on which a company can be objectively
parameterized. It will also form the groundwork for further analysis, for example, whether
the company is borrowing money greater than its peers within the same industry.
3.3    Using XBRL in Conjunction with Bankruptcy Credit
Formulas
The ability to extract over 1500+ data points from the XBRL data set on each company is
a game changer and this gives us a great opportunity to analyse the credit risk of a
company in question, their trading partners as well as the whole industry.   XBRL data
submitted daily by companies to UK Companies House are updated on our system

The combination of extracted XBRL data and the Altman Z-Score formula have not only
allowed us to bypassed the need to use an external credit reference agency, but have also
allowed us to gain a technological and financial edge over our competitors.   We have
effectively created our own in-house credit rating system which is more advanced than
the current industry standard.

The Z-score formula published in 1968 by Edward I. Altman is a standard formula used
globally in the financial industry. The formula provides three predictive measures:
the probability that a business will go into bankruptcy within two years,
whether a business will default on obligations,
a control measure for financial distress.
The Z-score uses multiple corporate income and balance sheet values to measure the
financial health of a company.
4.1    Accuracy and Effectiveness
In its initial test, the Altman Z-Score was found to be  72% accurate    in predicting
bankruptcy two years before the event, with a Type II error (false negatives)   of 6%
(Altman E. I., 1968).
In a series of subsequent tests covering three periods over the next 31 years (up until
1999), the model was found to be approximately 80%-90% accurate   in predicting
bankruptcy one year before the event, with a Type II error (classifying the firm as bankrupt
when it does not go bankrupt) of approximately 15%-20% (Altman E. , 2000).
From  about                                                                                    1985  onwards,  the  Z-scores  gained  wide  acceptance  by  auditors,
management accountants, courts, and database systems used for loan evaluation. The
formula's approach has been used in a variety of contexts and countries, although it was
designed originally for publicly held manufacturing companies with assets of more than
$1 million.
Later variations by Altman were designed to be applicable to privately held companies
(the Altman Z-score) and non-manufacturing companies (the Altman Z-score). Neither the
Altman models nor other balance sheet-based models are recommended for use with
financial companies. This is because of the opacity of financial companies' balance sheets
and their frequent  use of off-balance  sheet  items.

The transparency of events along the supply chain via the Blockchain is itself a major
enabler of faster payments and improved financing, increased efficiency, reduced risk of
fraud, and lower costs. Exchanging information related to these events in a distributed
ledger facilitates trigger events that need to take place for goods to arrive at their final
destination and for suppliers to receive payment. But the capability of the Blockchain to
facilitate these trigger events does not end with the mere exchange of information along
a supply chain.
The use of smart contracts to not only trigger events but actually carry them out
automatically represents a bold evolution that is being actively explored by a few today.
Smart contracts are self-executing computer codes that automatically carry out functions
once a triggering event has taken place. It is a linear contract that can include multiple
parties                                                                                        (investors, borrowers, buyers, sellers  etc.)  and  that  cannot  be  altered   (EBA
Association, 2016).
For example, if a smart contract is written between an invoice seller and an invoice buyer
to say that once the invoice buyer is victorious in a crowd funding process, 80% of the
funds will be released to the invoice seller, a smart contract would automatically
disburse    payment    once confirmation is entered into a distributed ledger that the
crowd-funding   process as closed. The confirmation of approval by the crowd-funding
process is not a triggering event requiring action by a bank; the payment is automatically
made once confirmation has been entered into the system.
With a smart contract, legal stipulations are embedded in the computer code, which
enables the automatic execution of functions defined by a legal contract. It also provides
protection against duplicate invoice financing, as the contract will not allow for an
invoice that has already been financed to receive additional financing. A smart contract,
therefore, acts as an application layer that is built on the Blockchain.
The development of the Blockchain that supports the smart contracts we are developing
is already built and readily available and globally known as Ethereum Virtual Machine
‘EVM’ in a number of countries. Some see smart contracts as the future of the Blockchain,
as they enable    more efficiencies in legal contracts through a decrease in manual
processing and initiation of contract terms, risk reduction through the elimination of
manual errors and duplicate invoice financing, which could make value propositions such
as micropayments more feasible.

5.1    Actors
Administrator
The platform administrator approves and manages clients’ accounts and actions.
Invoice seller
Clients can register as an invoice sellers to sell invoices on the platform. The
invoice seller must be reviewed and approved, before he can sell invoices on the
platform.
Invoice buyer
Clients can register as an invoice buyers on the platform to bid on auctioned
invoices. The invoice buyer if using fiat must be reviewed and approved before
he  can  use  the  platform.     However,  invoice  buyers  using  supported
cryptocurrencies or PPT can used the platform anonymously.
5.2    System Modules
The full Populous smart contracts   system specification   is beyond the scope of the
current document and we will review only some of the main modules of the system -
bank module, auction module and external tokens module (implements the Ethereum
ERC  20  token  standard  (The  Ethereum Wiki, n.d.)). They provide  the  programming
interface for interaction with the system.
Access to the bank and auction modules’ functionality is restricted to ensure the business
operations will be performed only inside the platform. Parts of the external tokens
module’s functionality are restricted as well (minting and destruction of tokens), while
the functionality described   in the ERC 20 specification   is publicly accessible to every
Ethereum address, which has tokens (Vogelsteller, 2015).
Bank
The module manages the internal ledger for all platform accounts and the
connection between the internal ledger and the external tokens.
Auction
The module manages auction operations. The administrator creates auctions
based on the data provided by the invoice sellers. Invoice buyers can use the
platform to create bidding groups for invoice auctions and make bids on them.
The auction module is logically connected to the IPFS distributed web - every
invoice auction has hash references to related documents uploaded on the IPFS
web.

External tokens
Every worldwide government currency, which is supported by the platform, has
a corresponding smart contract, which implements the Ethereum ERC 20 token
standard. Clients can withdrawal their funds outside the platform into these
smart contracts, to gain sovereign access to their tokens.

1 -  Ends auction automatically when the sales goal is reached, or automatically when the auction period expires or
manually by the invoice seller.
2 -  When the invoice seller receives payment from his customers and deposits the money to Populous. The funds are
automatically disbursed back to the liquidity pool and interest paid to the invoice buyer. The funding is then closed.
3 - The invoice seller can manually terminate the auction early and select the first bid with the lowest interest rate.
4 - Both invoice buyers and sellers must provide KYC data before their accounts can be approved.
5 - Clients can exchange Pokens for any supported currency. For example: convert Poken USD to Poken EUR.

5.4    Invoice Auctions
When the invoice seller registers, he must provide information and documents
about his company.
The administrator approves or places a hold on his account based on the provided
information.
Before the invoice is approved for sale - the invoice sellers  provides  information for the
invoice and the administrator approves or rejects the invoice:
The invoice seller provides documentation and related information for the invoice,
and requested sales goal.
The administrator generates a credit score for the seller’s invoice.
The administrator approves or rejects the invoice based on the credit score of the
Invoice.  Service fees are also defined.
When the invoice is approved, the auction of the invoice starts. All auctions are for the
duration of 24 hours. Invoice buyers can bid individually or create bidding groups to bid
on the invoice as described in 3.2. The auction can end in three ways:
1.  A bid matches the asking sales goal within the 24 hours bid duration.
2.  The invoice seller decides to terminate before the auction duration have expired.
- He can accept the funds from the first best bid offered, even if the bid have not
reached the asking sales goal.
- He can cancel the auction.
3.  The auction duration expires. Invoice seller doesn’t receive bids matching the
asking sales goal.
- He can accept the funds from the first best bid offered, even if the bid have not
reached the asking sales goal.
- He can restart the auction again.
- He can cancel the auction.
When the auction is successful:
The invoice seller receives funds from the winning buyer or group, which
have won the auction.
16




Funds are return to the losing buyers or group(s) for their bid. The invoice seller
exchanges the Pokens to fiat and make a withdraw. When the invoice seller receives
payment from his customer he deposits the money with Populous and make
payment to settle the loan.
When the payment is made by the invoice seller, the funds are disbursed back to the
liquidity pool and interest paid to the winning bidder or bid group.   Each invoice
buyer  who  bid  in  a  group  will  receive  interest  proportional  to  his  bidding
contributions.
If the auction is not successful:
The invoice seller has the options to restart or cancel the auction.
If the auction is cancelled:
The invoice buyers from all bidding groups are refunded their bids.
5.5    Bidding on Auctions
Invoice buyers will receive Pokens to bid on invoices by depositing PPT into the
platform. To receive an address to deposit PPTs, all invoice buyers must provide
personal KYC information before they are approved.
The administrator approves or places a hold on his account based on the provided
information.
In the case of approval, the invoice buyer can use the platform to:
1.  Deposit PPTs and receive Pokens.
2.  Browse active auctions and bid groups.
3.  Create bidding groups for active auctions. Every bidding group will specify a bid goal
which must be same as the asking sales goal or less.
4.  Bid on auctions in bid group(s).
17




5.6    Wallets
Financial transactions such as deposits and withdrawal are performed in “Wallets”.   All
transaction records of PPT are recorded there.  Exchange of deposits to Pokens will also
be facilitated in “Wallets” and you can also search the history of all transactions made.
5.6.1    Flow of Funds
The flow of funds within the platform is realised by the use of custom stable tokens
called Poken.   Poken is the in-platform crypto-currency and is the sole crypto-currency
used on the platform to transfer value between sellers and buyers. Poken is a fiat-pegged
crypto-currency and the Poken GBP is the base crypto-currency used on the platform.
The value of 1 Poken GBP is equivalent to 1 GBP.
The use of Poken allows us to operate on the Ethereum Blockchain to take advantage of
smart contracts while avoiding the direct usage of Ethereum and associated volatility.
Pokens can be exchanged for fiat currencies (subject to exchange rates) and withdrawn
from the platform.   Pokens are similar to any other crypto-currency and can also be
withdrawn from the platform.
Pokens within the platform
Populous manages an internal ledger of   Poken balance for invoice sellers and invoice
buyers for each currency denomination they may hold. Only Populous have access to this
internal ledger and records internal transactions between accounts on behalf of the
invoice sellers and invoice buyers by their actions on the platform.
Pokens outside the platform
Poken is an ERC20 compatible cryptocurrency and behave just like any Ethereum based
cryptocurrency and can be withdrawn from the platform to external Ethereum based
wallets.   Pokens of any currency denomination can be withdrawn.   For example, Poken
EUR can be withdrawn to wallets external to the platform.  This allows the possibility to
access the Poken independently of the platform.
5.6.2    Deposit of Funds
When a deposit of PPT is made, users may receive a discounted amount of Pokens into
their wallet. This discount rate is subject to change.
18




Deposit worldwide government’s currency
Currently only fiat denominated in GBP, USD, EUR or Yen can be deposited and all other
currencies will be converted to GBP based on prevailing exchange rates set by the
London Stock Exchange.
Poken is pegged to fiat at a ratio of 1:1 and this applies to all supported fiat denominated
currencies.  For example, 1 Poken GBP = 1 GBP, 1 Poken USD = 1 USD, 1 Poken EUR = 1
EUR or 1 Poken Yen = 1 Yen.
Deposit Poken
Pokens obtained outside of the platform can be deposited onto the platform.
5.6.3    Withdrawal of Funds
The platform offers three ways to withdraw funds:
Withdraw worldwide government’s currency
Fiat in the support currency denomination can be withdrawn from the platform.  Pokens
are first exchanged for fiat before withdrawal can be made.   Fiat will be transferred to
registered bank account anywhere in the world.  Platform fees apply upon withdrawal.
Withdraw Pokens
Pokens  can  be  withdrawn  from  the  platform  to  external  Ethereum  based  wallets.
Platform fees apply upon withdrawal.

6.                                                                                            Incentive
The cost of credit insurance can sometimes rise up to 3% for an invoice seller with an
invoice value of  £100,000. With the implementation of our XBRL system, we see a
reduction in this cost for an invoice seller, whose invoice is valued at £100,000. Our
approach to credit risk analysis will lead to better understanding of the industry as a
whole when making crucial credit decision as well as finding investment opportunities
for our invoice buyers and funding for our invoice sellers.
The use of credit reference agencies and third party data providers will be minimal as we
are currently aware that major data providers such as Dun & Bradstreet, Experian etc. are
yet to implemented XBRL and still rely on predated methods of compiling their data,
which would bear a huge burden on an invoice factoring platform budget should they
wish to perform analysis at will which is demonstrated earlier on in this whitepaper.
With an overall reduction in the cost subscription to third party services and the reliance
on third party data, our resources can be put to greater use in bringing potential
customers to the platform and creating value for invoice buyers on the platform.

Many companies have not yet come to the realisation that integration of blockchain with
XBRL data will play an important role in the finance industry going forward and Populous
is the exception.   Banks and traditional invoice finance companies will soon follow suit
and try to utilise XBRL data to make credit risk based funding decisions.
Due to the availability of sophisticated algorithms that aid credit decision making for
banks and existing invoice finance providers, the use of XBRL data as an effective tool to
assess credit risk have not been adopted.  Financial data is rarely available in the format
needed to develop and perform in-depth credit risk and industry analysis.  However, we
have built a P2P lending platform that leverages XBRL data, smart contracts and the
Blockchain as a solution to automate the whole funding process from start to finish on
the platform.
Establish data providers such as Experian, Fame and Dun & Bradstreet provide financial
data at a high cost and anyone in the financial industry requiring credit risk or any
financial related information will find costs prohibited.  It is important to note that there
is no real substitute for a stringent underwriting process and more importantly the
on-site due diligence of clients.   While we are yet to see the emergence of a platform
similar to Populous, there is already a fintech competitor attempting to replicate what we
have done.
