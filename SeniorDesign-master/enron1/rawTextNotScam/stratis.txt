Summary
Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) offers a radically different paradigm
of storing and managing information online. Decentralised ledgers lack the points of
failure and associated security issues of traditional databases and top-down protocols,
whilst at the same time posing their own unique challenges for effective deployment and
maintenance.
The advantages in terms of costs, transparency, immutability, security and confidence
that  are  characteristic  of   blockchain  solutions  mean  that   financial  businesses,
government departments and other organisations are exploring applications of all kinds
with  a  view  to  delivering  services  more  profitably  and  efficiently.  However,  reliable
deployment of a new blockchain fit for purpose entails extensive overheads in terms of
network infrastructure, development, security and ongoing maintenance. Moreover, use
of  an  existing  blockchain                                                                       (such  as  Bitcoin)  comes  with  numerous  problems  for  a
mainstream business, not least because users have no control over blockchain features
or future development.
An attractive model for blockchain service provision exists in cloud computing. Cloud
services may be tailored according to the needs of the organisation and infrastructure,
platforms and software provided as services via web interfaces  - without businesses
having to take on the maintenance of these themselves.
Stratis will take a similar approach to blockchain deployment, enabling organisations to
provision their own private blockchains, tailored to their precise needs but secured on
the parent Stratis chain. This approach means there are few unnecessary overheads
whilst  allowing  businesses  to  secure  the  benefits  of  a  blockchain-based  solution,
developing services via powerful APIs and lite web-based clients.

Blockchain: a distributed ledger
What is the blockchain?
A blockchain or distributed ledger is new way of storing and transferring information.
Centralised databases have been employed for many years by financial corporations and
other organisations to store customer details and record transactions of one kind or
another.  These  are  carefully-guarded  and  closed  systems  in  which  only  privileged
operators are allowed to make entries. When a customer transfers money from one bank
account to another, they make a request to the bank to do so on their behalf rather than
engaging directly with the database that holds information about balances. Centralisation
is inherent in the paradigm.
This carries certain implications. A centralised system is one that by definition has a point
of failure. It is also one that implies a power differential because the privileged operators
have the prerogative to intervene - for example, by unilaterally reversing a transaction
or imposing new charges.
The blockchain offers a radically different approach. The Bitcoin protocol,[1] launched in
2009, established for the first time the viability of transferring value on a peer-to-peer
basis over the internet, without the need for a trusted intermediary. Satoshi Nakamoto,
the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, solved the ‘double spend’ problem: the issue that
digital  information  can  easily  be  copied,  and  therefore  a  centralised  authority  was
previously required to reflect where funds were located.
At its simplest, the blockchain is a digital record stored on a network of computers around
the world. Instead of securing information by restricting access, the blockchain shares
information amongst all users. Ownership of funds  (for example) is cryptographically
verified, and the full transparency and mutual ownership of the system means that a bad
actor is immediately recognisable as such and any transactions submitted by such a node
are ignored.
The decentralised structure of the blockchain brings several key features in contrast to
traditional centralised approaches:
    Transparency: it is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one
account to another.
    Immutability: once confirmed, a transaction cannot be reversed. No one can
interfere with a completed transfer.
    Low cost: transaction fees are minimal.
    Cross-border: funds can be sent as easily to someone on the other side of the
world as they can to someone in the next room.
    Speed: due to the flat and transparent nature of the blockchain, transfers show
up almost instantly and are typically confirmed in minutes, rather than hours or
days.

for adoption by real-world financial businesses.
The  rise  of  Bitcoin  and  similar  protocols  was
accompanied  by  a  rapid  re-evaluation  by  governments,  regulators  and  the  financial
services  industry  of  the  existing  paradigms.  Due  to  Bitcoin’s  position  outside  of  the
control of state and financial authorities and its potential for misuse as a tool of fraud,
money laundering and other illegal activity, as well as other concerns such as its volatility
and the unregulated  nature of the exchanges on which  it  traded, the first reactions
tended to be scepticism and concern. However, an increasing number of actors have also
recognised the potential of blockchain technology and the broad range of use cases to
which the distributed ledger lends itself.
A noticeable shift has occurred towards the end of 2015 and in 2016, with a series of
national  governments  and  major  banks  now  actively  undertaking  research  into
distributed ledger technology (DLT) as a means of creating more effective money and
delivering more efficient public services - not least the UK government[2], China, South
Korea, Goldman Sachs and UBS, amongst others. Around  $1 billion  was  invested  in
Bitcoin-related companies in 2015 alone.[3]
The benefits of blockchain technology for companies and organisations of all sizes and
types are becoming ever clearer. However, until now there have been few options for
those who wish to deploy or use blockchain technology. They either have to invest the
time and funds to create and maintain their own protocol from scratch, or use an existing
open platform (such as Bitcoin itself), with all the limitations and problems that entails.

Cloud computing
What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing refers to the practice of accessing data and IT resources via a remote
provider, rather than relying solely on in-house hardware and software.
In the internet era, businesses and individuals no longer need to purchase and maintain
their own hardware, or even run their own software platforms. Instead, these can be
housed by third parties in dedicated data centres and accessed as and when required.
The benefits of such an approach are extensive. It means that resources can be allocated
and paid  for  according to  need,  rather  than  purchased  inefficiently  and  in  advance;
economies of scale are inherent in cloud provision. This allows for far greater flexibility
and control over budgets, as well as enabling companies to scale rapidly when required.
Consequently, almost all of us now use cloud computing in some form, particularly for
email  (including popular webmail platforms like Gmail and Yahoo) and storage  (cloud
drives such as AWS, OpenDrive, iCloud, Dropbox and so on).
Although storage is one of the most popular applications of cloud computing, almost any
IT  resource  an  organisation  needs  can  be  provided  in  this  way.  Over  and  above
Infrastructure-as-a-Service                                                                     (IaaS),  which  includes  servers,  storage  and  network
provision, there is a growing move to meet all computing needs via the cloud. Platform-
as-a-Service  (PaaS)  comprises  the  delivery  of  development  tools  and  frameworks,
databases  and  execution  environments,  whilst  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS)  allows
applications to be run from the cloud.

What is the Stratis platform?
Overview
Stratis is a powerful and flexible blockchain Development Platform designed for the needs
of real-world financial services businesses and other organisations that want to develop,
test and deploy applications on the blockchain. Stratis blockchain apps can be developed
in pure C# and can also utilize the Microsoft .NET framework, while also taking advantage
of  the  powerful  Stratis  APIs  and  framework.  Stratis  significantly  simplifies  the
development   process   for   creating   Blockchain   applications   and   accelerates   the
development lifecycle for blockchain development projects. Stratis private chains allow
businesses to deploy their own customised blockchains without the overheads inherent
in running their own blockchain network infrastructure. Stratis’s turnkey solution enables
developers  and  businesses  to  create,  test  and  deploy  blockchain-based  applications
quickly and easily, all without the costs and security concerns that would otherwise arise
from an in-house implementation.
Stratis  will  be  developing  a  Bitcoin  full  node  in  C#  utilising  the  trusted  and  proven
architecture of Bitcoin. The Stratis Platform will then be built on top of this innovative
C# fully validating node (tailored to Stratis’s own needs) whilst also adding a broad range
of powerful new features on top of it. In addition, Stratis will enable the deployment of
customisable sidechains.
Stratis will continue to maintain and further develop the Bitcoin version of the NStratis
Full Node. The Stratis Bitcoin Full Node and the NStratis framework will be open source,
so anyone can inspect it, clone/modify it and use it for their own purposes - contributing
to a healthy ecosystem and the mutually beneficial sharing of ideas and development
efforts.

Page 6 of20




Architecture and development
The  Stratis  platform  will  be  built  on  the  C#  Stratis  Bitcoin  Full  node  platform  and
framework.  The  Stratis  Bitcoin  Full  node  will  be  developed  on  top  of  the  NBitcoin
library,[6] a near-complete port of Bitcoin Core written in C# and  .NET by blockchain
developer Nicolas Dorier. There will also be a C++ Wallet and full node version based on
Bitcoin Core, though the majority of nodes on the network will be NStratis (C#) nodes.
NBitcoin is a complete and proven blockchain framework that is already in use, and will
enable accelerated development.
Stages in NStratis development will include:
1.  Development of the Stratis Bitcoin Full Node
2.  Fork the Stratis Bitcoin Full Node for NStratis
3.  Implement the required changes to NStratis and port Elements sidechains to C#.
Benefits
There are several advantages to building Stratis on the NBitcoin platform.[7]
    It was developed in pure C# and it utilizes the Microsoft .NET framework, which
is easier to maintain and develop further than the traditional C++ Bitcoin Core
source code.
    C# is one of the dominant languages in business application development and it
offers several advantages over C++.
    NBitcoin is currently the only cross-platform alternative Bitcoin implementation
available.  Stratis  will  upgrade  the  code  base  to  .NET  Core,  Microsoft’s  latest
version of .NET that can run natively across even more devices.

Architecture of the Stratis Bitcoin Full Node
A full node is an application whose goal is to keep track of valid blocks in the blockchain.
It is essentially composed of several layers:
   Network Layer - this deals with which messages are exchanged between full
nodes, and how.
   Consensus Layer - this sets the (blockchain-wide) rules for what is considered a
valid block.
   Node Policy Layer -   this adds more restrictive rules than the Consensus Layer to
prevent DDoS (node-wide rule).
   Infrastructure Layer - governs how to store and verify blocks and transactions
efficiently.
   Interface Layer - API for developers to query the state of the node, and/or user
interface.
Interface Layer
Infrastructure Layer                                                                             Stratis Bitcoin Full Node (C#)
                                                                                                 Bitcoin Core
Node Policy Layer
(C++)
LibConsensus (C++)
Consensus Layer
NBitcoin (C#)
Network Layer
While Bitcoin Core deals with all these layers in the same source code, Stratis Bitcoin
Full Node will only have to deal with the Node Policy Layer, Infrastructure Layer and
Interface Layer.
The Consensus Layer is an integral component in the Full Node architecture that should
ideally not be modified without industry-wide consensus, since a bug in this layer could
cause a fork in the Blockchain and result in loss of funds. As a result of this risk Consensus
Layer should be as close to Bitcoin Core as possible.
Bitcoin  Core  provides  part  of  the  consensus  code  in  a  library  called  LibConsensus.
NBitcoin will be used to fill in any gaps. To simplify the transition to the Stratis Bitcoin
Full Node, all of the RPC API endpoints available in Bitcoin Core will be provided, so users
and businesses will not have to rewrite their software to utilise the Stratis Bitcoin Full
Node. Stratis Bitcoin Full Node in C# and Microsoft’s .NET Framework

Stratis Bitcoin Full Node
Bitcoin was originally developed by Satoshi Nakamoto as a piece of software that bundled
together several different functionalities. What users called  ‘Bitcoin’ was at the same
time the protocol, the wallet, the key storage, the mining software, the infrastructure for
other apps, and the full node.
As with all maturing technology, the Bitcoin industry became more and more specialised,
and the functionality once provided only by Bitcoin Core has now been diffused among
different players in the industry. An all-purpose piece of software has now been replaced
and complemented by multiple specialised parties and applications.
The most basic layer of Bitcoin on which everybody depends is a full node. Changing the
code of a full node is a controversial matter, as the consequences impact virtually every
company in the ecosystem. On the other hand, if consensus about an improvement to
Bitcoin is reached and a new feature is successfully implemented in the full node, then
the benefits ripple out across the whole industry. A typical example is the new OP_CSV
and  Segregated  Witness  improvement  that  will  allow  the  development  of  off-chain
payments, which will permit Bitcoin to scale as a currency.
At present, the most popular Bitcoin node is called Bitcoin Core and is developed in C++.
The Bitcoin Core team is a group of highly skilled developers who generally adopt a very
conservative approach to accepting improvements. One of the reasons for this is that a
full node is such a critical component for Bitcoin that any new features require extensive
reviews and testing. Contributors to Bitcoin Core generally work on it for free, and their
review time is valuable but limited.
We believe that one way to allow improvements to be implemented faster is to develop
a full node in C# instead of C++. Highly skilled C++ engineers are in short supply in the
corporate world, which tends to prefer higher-level languages like C# or Java. Higher-
level languages are also easier to review and learn, and it is harder to make coding
mistakes.
As such, we propose that the Stratis Bitcoin Full Node will be based on the NBitcoin
framework, which is the most complete and portable library for developing blockchain
applications and platforms in C# and Microsofts .NET.

Stratis: key features
Stratis  allows  the  creation  of  distinct,  private  blockchains,  launched  by  third  party
organisations and tailored to their needs but secured on the main Stratis blockchain.
They can be accessed via lite clients and simple but powerful APIs. Because these Private
chains are based upon the code of the main Stratis chain and side chains are compatible
and transfer between the two is straightforward.[8]
Stratis Private chains
A secure  blockchain  network will typically consist  of hundreds  or even thousands  of
computers running the same protocol. Consequently, there are significant advantages to
employing an established network with proven stability and security, rather than starting
from  scratch.  Although  it  is  possible  to  develop  applications  on  top  of  the  Bitcoin
blockchain, the first and still the best-known and most secure cryptocurrency network,
there are good reasons why few businesses would want to so. Bitcoin has comparatively
slow  10-minute confirmation times, and periodic attacks on the network means that
transactions  can  be  delayed  for  hours;  addressing  these  effectively  requires  a
controversial hard fork and the pace of development is slow. Businesses have no control
over upgrades or other changes to the network such as the capacity of each block and
the rate that transactions that may be processed. Thus Bitcoin’s security advantages
come at a cost of significant rigidity and unpredictability.
By contrast, Stratis private chains allow developers complete freedom to customise their
implementation for their specific needs, whilst the underpinning  ‘parent’ blockchain is
established enough to give users a high degree of confidence in its security. For example,
if a business requires large block sizes
to  accommodate  a  high  volume  of
transactions;   rapid   block   times   to
enable low-latency trading; controlled
transactions  so  that  only  approved
users  can  submit  a  request  to  the
network; a given rate of inflation; or
additional space for metadata in each
block,  any  or  all  of  these  can  be
specified at launch. The private chain
can  be  accessed  by  straightforward
APIs,    meaning    that    stand-alone

Stratis blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS)
Given both the advantages of cloud computing and the benefits of blockchain technology,
there  is  a  strong  business  case  for  deploying  distributed  ledgers  in  the  same  way,
tailoring them according to the needs of the organisation in question. As with other forms
of cloud usage, this allows an on-demand payment model, as well as scalability and
removing the need for costly hardware and specialist expertise. BaaS enables an off-the-
peg approach to blockchain use, placing it within the reach of any organisation.
The nature of the blockchain means that it cannot readily be located within the traditional
framework of IaaS/PaaS/SaaS. Blockchains are software, run on distributed networks of
computers. Moreover,  ‘blockchain’ is a catch-all term for an approach to storage and
consensus; blockchain protocols can provide a breadth of services as straightforward as
value transfer (Bitcoin) to the execution of smart contracts (Ethereum). Thus there is a
case for considering BaaS as the provision of infrastructure, platform and software at the
same time.
Specifically, BaaS allows developers to test and deploy their bespoke blockchain-based
applications  in  the  cloud,  without  having  to  maintain  the  network  or  full  clients
themselves. The implementation of the blockchain can be tailored to their needs and
accessed via lite clients or APIs.
Decentralised app hosting
As well as offering the services integrated in its own blockchain, Stratis will specialise in
providing hosting and consultancy for decentralised applications (Dapps) on top of the
Ethereum blockchain. This enables a complete off-the-peg approach to smart contracts.
Stratis will work closely with businesses to determine their needs, before deploying nodes
if required and organising hosting. This allows clients to focus solely on creating dapps
without expending time and resources on infrastructure.
Bitcoin, Ethereum, LISK node provisioning
These solutions will not be confined to the Stratis chain and private chains. Stratis will
enable one-click provisioning of other major blockchain platforms aside from its own,
including Bitcoin, Ethereum, BitShares and LISK - each of which has its own character,
community  of  developers  and  use  cases.  Thus  if  an  organisation  wishes  to  test  out
different networks, or use them in parallel to employ different functionality, there is
nothing to stop them doing so quickly and easily.
For example, Ethereum’s smart contracts and the WAVES decentralised asset exchange
offer  functionality  not  implemented  by  Stratis  but  that  will  be  useful  to  certain
businesses, either in combination with Stratis or on its own. Stratis Consultancy will
provide consultancy services for many different blockchain solutions and can advise on
which blockchain-based solution is most appropriate, and how businesses might go about
deploying this, as well as installing required software and provisioning nodes if required.

This  off-the-peg  provisioning  reduces  the  unnecessary  overheads  for  blockchain
deployment  to  near  zero  and  makes  Stratis  the  most  convenient  and  cost-effective
solution currently available.
One-click deployment
Stratis makes it easier than ever before for organisations to deploy private blockchains,
taking a cloud services approach to provisioning. A one-click process means that new
chains  can  be  launched  with  unprecedented  speed,  tailored  for  the  needs  of  the
organisation.  A  broad  range  of  variables  including  block  time,  size  and  space  for
metadata are customisable, making it incredibly flexible. Essentially, an entire network
can be bootstrapped on the back of the main chain, giving a ready-made cryptocurrency
ecosystem for developers to use out of the box.

Three-tier architecture
The Stratis platform uses a three-tier architecture typical of the Microsoft® ASP.NET
application style. This is a good fit as the Stratis Full Node, Stratis Blockchain API and
the  Stratis  SPV  technology  are  developed  in  C#  and  run  within  the  Microsoft  .NET
Framework and common language runtime.
In the client tier, Browsers, Desktops, Mobiles, and IOT  (Internet of Things) devices
connect to the various services in the application tier. They receive blockchain data by
querying the Stratis Chain API via HTTPS.
The application tier is composed of the Stratis Chain API, Cloud Stratis Management
portal, Cloud Stratis API and Secure Payment Verification (SPV). All of the components
in  the  application  tier  are  developed  in  C#.  The  application  tier  handles  Blockchain
requests and SPV proofs for Lite clients that do not download the full blockchain. It also
provides access to the Stratis Cloud management portal and API.
The server tier consists of the Stratis Full blockchain Node, the Cloud Stratis hosting
layer and the Stratis payment protocol.
Stratis consultancy
The Stratis’s headquarters will be based in London, a global financial centre and a hub
for fintech services.
As  thought  leaders  and  practitioners  of  distributed  ledger  technology,  Stratis  will
leverage its own expertise by offering consultancy services to other businesses working
in the sector, thereby driving forward blockchain adoption and forging key partnerships
where opportunities are presented.
London’s  light-touch  approach  to  regulation  means  that  many  other  cryptocurrency
businesses  are  choosing  the  city  for  their  headquarters  and  there  is  a  growing
concentration of skills and experience, as well as extensive access to traditional financial
services businesses. Although Stratis’s consultancy work will predominantly be within
the UK, it will be expanded worldwide if there is demand. The work will focus on several
key areas:
Blockchain consultancy
Stratis's consultancy arm will work with businesses to help them explore how blockchain
technology  can  help  them.  Distributed  ledger  technology  offers  numerous  specific
benefits, but it is not a panacea and is not necessary or helpful in all cases. Stratis will
help businesses and organisations of all sizes to pinpoint where they can save money

and increase efficiency, transparency and security using blockchain technology, and the
solutions that are best suited for their circumstances and needs.
Active development for the Bitcoin ecosystem
Stratis's  developers  will  actively  contribute  to  the  development  of  Bitcoin  Core  and
Elements side chains,[9] while also further developing NBitcoin, the most complete C#
.net Bitcoin  library.  The team will develop the  Bitcoin version  of NBitcoin  while also
creating their own NStratis version, rather than forking the code and developing this
independently. Core to the aims of Stratis is to contribute to the ongoing development
of other key projects in the relevant space.
This will not only help to advance blockchain technology more broadly, but will position
Stratis as one of the top blockchain companies. Stratis will be based on the latest version
of Bitcoin, so it will be a simple matter to implement any technology developed for Bitcoin
(and in many cases from Stratis to Bitcoin).

Scalability
Scalability is a major issue for cryptocurrency protocols. Because every transaction is
stored on the blockchain for transparency and immutability, in an unoptimised blockchain
the size of the chain is a function of the number of transactions. This can cause serious
issues. Bitcoin’s 1 MB block sizes limit it to a low throughput of transactions per second
(tps), and tensions between different stakeholders in the Bitcoin ecosystem (including
miners,  large  holders/advocates  and  end-users)  have  meant  that  the  problem  has
proven extremely difficult to fix. The result has been that there have been periods when
transactions  have  been  delayed  because  there  is  not  enough  space  in  a  block.
Consequently, few serious businesses would voluntarily expose themselves to the risks
of using the Bitcoin blockchain for third-party applications, having no control over the
future of the protocol and no influence over any improvements that might be made.
For Bitcoin, the problem of transaction volumes may yet be solved by a hard fork to
enable larger blocks, but this is still a suboptimal solution. As transaction volumes grow
exponentially with greater adoption (in the best case scenario), block size will also have
to grow exponentially. This places greater demands on full nodes in terms of bandwidth
and disk space. Despite expected advances in storage and connectivity technology, this
will  likely  lead  to  an  even  greater  centralisation  of  mining,  in  which  only  the  best-
resourced  nodes  can  afford  to  maintain  the  network.  Aside  from  any  political  and
ideological concerns, this has implications for network security.
Stratis  addresses  these  problems  in  several  different  ways.  Firstly,  every  private
blockchain is configurable, meaning that an organisation can choose how large blocks
should be - reflecting their own needs and resources.
Related to this, instead of using a single ledger for every application, Stratis comprises
a host chain from which financial businesses can deploy their own ledgers depending on
their specific requirements, rather than directly using the same blockchain as the whole
Stratis network (or the whole Bitcoin ecosystem, if the Bitcoin blockchain was employed).
This offers the remarkable versatility of an extensive 2.0 platform, combined with the
full  control  of  a  private  chain                                                                  -  secured  by  the  host  blockchain  but  tailored  and
administrated by the owning organisation.
On a separate note, Stratis employs a proof-of-stake approach to consensus which aligns
the interests of end-users (businesses) and those tasked with securing the network (full
nodes). This means that a business can run a full Stratis node as well as nodes for their
own blockchain without the overheads associated with specialist mining hardware.
Lastly, a series of measures will be used to combat bloat on the main chain, which
ultimately  serves  as  a  means  to  secure  child  chains  and  can  therefore  be  kept  as
lightweight as possible.

Bitcoin compatibility
Because Stratis’s Private chains are based on the same code as the main blockchain, the
interface for private chains is 100% compatible with that of the main Stratis chain. Stratis
will provide the same RPC API as Bitcoin Core initially, which means that any applications
or platforms that use Bitcoin’s RPC or command line can be ported quickly to Stratis.
New functionality is provided by Stratis-specific API calls.
The compatibility between main and Private chains also means that it is a simple matter
to incorporate new features developed for Stratis into a private chain - and potentially
vice versa, since any feature developed by a business could be released into a future
update of Stratis. However, this would only take place with the express consent of the
business. Although Stratis’s customers de facto have full use of every feature on the
Stratis  blockchain,  there  is  no  onus  on  them  to  make  privately-developed  features
available to others.
Conclusion
Stratis’s private blockchains offer several significant advantages over the creation of a
new chain from scratch, and for most organisations will provide all the required benefits
without  either  being  unnecessarily  restrictive  or  entailing  the  significant  overheads
involved in creating and maintaining a cryptocurrency network.
The  cloud  provisioning  approach  to  blockchain,  or  blockchain-as-a-Service                 (BaaS),
makes deploying a new chain a process as simple as signing up for an account and
selecting  required  parameters.  These  tailor-made  solutions  are  accessible  via  web
interfaces and APIs, although users can run full nodes for both their private chain and
the host Stratis network if they wish. Compatibility with Bitcoin means that Bitcoin-based
services can easily be ported to Stratis for additional functionality and convenience. As
a result, Stratis is positioned strongly for an entry into the BaaS space.

Case Studies
Proof of Existence
The immutable and transparent nature of the blockchain lends itself to applications in
which the existence of a file or document must be proved for a particular point in time.
Blockchain solutions are already informally used as a kind of digital copyright. Users take
a ‘hash’ - a cryptographic digest of a file that serves as a unique fingerprint - and upload
it to the blockchain. 2.0 blockchains that allow arbitrary messages to be recorded are
convenient for this purpose, but Bitcoin and other first-generation blockchains allow short
strings  of  characters  to  be  embedded  in  transactions.  Because  each  block  is  time-
stamped and each hash represents a specific file (changing even a single character of a
document or a pixel of an image results in a completely different hash), this proves with
beyond any reasonable degree of doubt that the file existed at the time that the hash
was uploaded. This is an approach that can be extended from copyright and patents to
contracts of all kinds, and even to establishing the physical condition of a property or a
hire car before it is used by a customer.
Clearing and settlement
Clearing and settlement is a major pain point for the banking industry, costing many
tens of billions of dollars every year. Recent research by Santander suggested that a
near real-time digital ledger for clearing could save over $20 billion per year. [4]
Many of the cost savings centre on the clearing and settlement cycle that is a feature of
most current investment markets. Counterparty balances across a wide range of markets
and financial institutions around the world are matched and reconciled on a rolling three-
day basis. Currently this takes place on technology that is more than 40 years old as
payments  are  batched  and sent  at  intervals  by a  system called Automated Clearing
House  (ACH).  There  are  significant  benefits  to  moving  this  process  to  a  blockchain
platform, as some major banks are now actively considering, thereby clearing payments
almost instantly. This could also potentially reduce the capital financial institutions have
to hold against trades.
For some multinational organisations where several different currencies may be in use
and funds moved between countries and departments on a daily basis - and particularly
for the remittance industry - such an approach could prove invaluable for cross-border
financial transfers. The blockchain potentially cuts the time for reconciliation down from
a day or more to just minutes. [5]

Creating a private blockchain
TradeCorp  is  a  financial  services  business  that  wishes  to  deploy  and  test  a  trading
platform that utilizes blockchain technology. As part of their Agile development, they
decide to develop a proof-of-concept platform to explore the issues they will face when
bringing their idea to market.
Due to the anticipated volume and speed of transactions, they require 10 MB blocks and
30-second  block  time,  and  hence  Bitcoin  is  not  fit  for  their  purposes.  Instead,  they
engage Stratis to deploy and host a Private Chain for them. This is achieved with the
following steps:
    Create an account on the Stratis Cloud Portal
    Purchase Stratis to fuel your Private Chain.  (There will be a simple process for
purchasing Stratis with many different payment options)
    Visit the provisioning tab on the Cloud management portal and select  ‘Deploy
private blockchain’. Provide the required blockchain specifications outlined below:
    Identifying Name of the blockchain
    Target block time (e.g. 30 seconds)
    Privacy level - any peer can join the network; private network; private or public
transactions
    Mining rewards  (private chain mining only). E.g.  100 native currency units per
block, halving every 100,000 blocks.
    Ports for P2P connections and the JSON-RPC API, e.g. 6060, 5721.
    Permitted transaction types, e.g. paytoaddress, paytomultisig, paytoscripthash.
    Maximum block size, e.g. 5 MB.
    Maximum metadata per transaction (OP_RETURN), e.g. 4,096 bytes.
    Click confirm/create new blockchain
    TradeCorp’s private blockchain has now been provisioned and their primary node
can be accessed via SSH on the IP/port displayed in  the Stratis management
portal.
TradeCorp now have a Private blockchain that is secured by the Stratis parent blockchain,
which  also  meets  their  exact  requirements.  They  also  have  access  to  the  all  of  the
technology developed by the Stratis projects, which can be deployed to their blockchain
with little development overhead.
The whole process can be completed in as little as 10 minutes.
Stratis is designed to make provisioning customised blockchains as easy as possible and
with the needs of the financial services industry in mind. These features mean that it is
a versatile solution for most businesses, from SMEs up to large financial organisations.

Fiat gateway
Financial  services  company  RemitCo  wishes  to  facilitate  the  remittance  of  funds  by
migrant workers in the Middle East back to their families at home. Although remittance
is a  $600 billion market, there is little competition in many locations and low-income
workers  may  be  heavily  penalised  in  various  ways.  Unofficial  services  run  by
unscrupulous operators leave them open to risk, and fees can be high - as much as 10%
of monthly pay. A lack of documentation and the comparatively small amounts of money
involved mean that many cannot access official banking and money transfer services.
Nevertheless,  a  high  proportion  are  web  literate  and  own  internet-enabled  mobile
phones.
RemitCo deploys a private blockchain on top of the Stratis network and creates a token
representing units of the local fiat currency in which migrant workers are paid. A service
in  the  host  country  collects  funds  from  employees  and  acts  as  a  gateway  to  the
blockchain. The workers now send these fiat tokens back to their families, which takes
seconds  or  minutes  instead  of  days,  costs  almost  nothing  and  is  fully  secure  and
transparent - there are no unwanted middlemen and no hidden costs. A separate branch
of  RemitCo  in  the  receiver's  country  acts  as  a  gateway  for  funds  back  out  of  the
blockchain.
Because RemitCo’s blockchain is private, there are no concerns about fraud or money
laundering since only approved personnel can move funds into and out of the blockchain.
Similarly,  the  use  of  fiat-equivalent  tokens  means  that  users  are  not  exposed  to
exchange rate volatility, as they would be if they used Bitcoin or other open protocols.
The remittance process is streamlined and cost-effective, meaning that RemitCo can
charge a smaller fee than the unofficial money transfer businesses, whilst offering a
better service for its customers. Thus Stratis offers advantages for RemitCo that would
not be available with a fully public blockchain.
Blitz sidechain
The Blitz blockchain already has a dedicated community and a series of services built on
top of it. These include the Fitalize platform, which uses fitness devices such as the Fitbit
to reward users with crypto coins on a per-step basis, and The Viral Exchange (TVE), a
social media project that leverages cryptocurrency payments to incentivise users to like,
share and follow posts for rapid publicity and growth.
In this example, the Blitz developers and community decide to move their blockchain to
the Stratis ecosystem, thereby gaining a series of benefits:
    Accelerated development. Blitz is now able to follow closely the code base of
Stratis, rather than spend time and resources maintaining its own version of the
network software. Very little development is required in order to update the code.

    New features. As well as its own features, Blitz can now use all of the features
offered by Stratis - again saving the time, money and effort otherwise required
to develop these from scratch on a separate chain.
    New network and network effect.  Blitz  will  keep  its  own services  and  the
businesses    it has built up around it, but it can now provide those to the whole
Stratis ecosystem  - enabling the community to access new markets and other
businesses.
    Continued independence. Blitz retains its own unique character, community
and     use-cases,  new  potential  users  notwithstanding.  The  developers  and
community  can  make  their  own  decisions  about  the  direction  taken  by  the
platform, facilitated but not restricted by being part of Stratis.
